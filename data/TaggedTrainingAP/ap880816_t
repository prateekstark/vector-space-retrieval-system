 Vanquished presidential candidate <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> appealed to his conservative, largely fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> supporters Tuesday and urged them to `` rally with wholehearted support'' behind <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` This party is about to nominate a man that I have come to respect and admire,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told the Republican National Convention in television prime time. `` This man can and will lead our nation proudly into the future.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, the TV evangelist whose presidential star faded quickly in an often-acrimonious primary campaign, described <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` a principled conservative'' and dismissed suggestions that his backers would sit out this election. `` We care because it does matter,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. As expected, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s backers, who had hoped to make the convention their own, staged only a brief demonstration waving blue and white signs and brightly colored umbrellas. His late-night speech came as many attending the convention began slipping out of the hall for the evening, leaving big blocks of empty seats. Two of the networks cut away from his speech in favor of other convention coverage as <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> went several minutes past prime time. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has spent the convention's opening days preaching party unity, and praising the conservative direction the party charted in its platform. Now, he said, it's time for conservatives and fundamentalists to join the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. `` I release my delegates and alternates who have come to this convention and urge you and all of my friends across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to give your enthusiastic support to our party, our candidates and our presidential nominee,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` It matters to us and our children whether we vote Democrat or whether we vote Republican,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> also attacked <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` the most liberal candidate ever put forward for the presidency by any major party in American history'' and said Democrats `` do not speak for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today.'' In one of the sharpest attacks of the convention on Democrats who held their convention last month, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> insisted `` the liberal mind set reigns supreme'' in that party. `` Now the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has discovered the family,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` But let's keep in mind that they want you and me to be in one family with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as the daddy, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> as the momma and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> as the big brother. `` They offer unlimited government, massive transfers of wealth from the productive sector of society to the non-productive, and ever-increasing regulation of the daily lives of the people and their children.'' In his prime-time speech and in a joint appearance with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the vice president's son, earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> sought not only to bring his supporters into the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp but also to cement his role as a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s conservative wing and guarantee a future that might include another run for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, backers said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s presidential hopes died early this year in an often bruising campaign, and some strategists worried that his backers, many of them fundamentalist Christians involved for the first time in politics, would simply drift away without strong urging from <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, an organization dedicated to removing all public affirmation of religious faith in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. `` As president, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will pack the federal courts with <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> radicals.''

 The big summer heat wave rolled on Tuesday with temperatures boiling past 100 to record highs from the eastern Plains to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, but the steamy Northeast finally got a break with a surge of cooler, drier air from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Utilities posted more records for demand for electricity as air conditioners and fans were turned on full blast. Some school districts in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> plan to open schools early and reduce class periods by almost half when school opens next week to avoid the hottest part of the day. `` By noon during summer school, it was very uncomfortable. If it was 90 outside, it was 95 to 100 in the classrooms. That's not a good atmosphere for learning,'' said associate principal <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokarski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rantoul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> -RRB- High School. `` I think this will be the hottest weather of the summer, taking both temperature and humidity into account,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Reitmeyer </PERSON>, a meteorologist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` We've had an oppressively hot and humid summer without a doubt,'' <PERSON> Reitmeyer </PERSON> said. `` But particular days such as this or tomorrow are rare.'' The temperature at <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, reached 102 degrees and <PERSON> Reitmeyer </PERSON> said that and the humidity would push the heat index, a measure of how hot it feels, the opposite of winter's wind chill factor, to 115. He said that is near life-threatening for some people. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> has had a total of 48 days of above-90 degrees this summer. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> reached a record high of 100 degrees, and that made it a record five times the city has hit 100 or higher this year. The old record was four times in 1936. Some other records included 90 at <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; 104 at <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>; 103 at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; 103 at <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, S.D.; 102 at <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>; 102 at <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; 101 at <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, S.D.; and 102 at <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. The 103 degrees at <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was the hottest reading since July 27, 1955. <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crosse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, marked the 44th day that the temperature achieved the 90 degree mark, another record. The 102-degree heat wilted about 10,000 competitors wearing heavy uniforms and carrying musical instruments at the <ORGANIZATION> Drum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Championships </ORGANIZATION> on the artificial turf at <LOCATION> Arrowhead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` You can feel it right through your tennis shoes,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDougall </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Edmonton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strutters </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` One of our melophone players almost passed out.'' The 136th <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> State Fair opened Tuesday with livestock exhibitors taking extra precautions, like putting ice in front of large fans to keep animals cool. Four chickens that were to be entered died when their owners left them in cars with the windows rolled up, fair officials said. The official high in the 48 contiguous states at 3 p.m. EDT was 105 degrees, not in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> or southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> but at <LOCATION> Chamberlin </LOCATION>, S.D. But nature's own air-conditioning _ in the form of a cool front from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ settled over the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>. Unfortunately, forecasts said the heat would soon return. After 32 days of 90-degree temperatures and swamp-like humidity, including a high of 97 Monday, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had a high Tuesday of merely 86 degrees. And the humidity was only around 39 to 42 percent, making it feel almost like early autumn compared to preceding weeks. `` The downturn in temperatures is certainly going to help not only <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> but all <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> utilities,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, spokesman for the utility that supplies <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s power. <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> had a record demand Monday of 10,160 megawatts of electricity. The failure of several feeder cables on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> knocked out service to more than 13,000 customers. And earlier Monday, the utility cut off power to 16 large apartment buildings on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> to prevent a wider blackout after several feeder cables failed, blacking out some 10,000 residents. The cooler air also brought relief for utilities in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was forced to impose a 5 percent voltage reduction Monday. But the clash of the hot and cool air also touched off thunderstorms, which knocked out power to thousands of customers across the state Monday. Farther south, utilities across <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> reported record electrical demand Monday and expected to exceed those amounts Tuesday, but no problems were reported. `` We've been going wild this summer,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovegrove </PERSON>, a spokesman for Ashland-based <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, which had records for power use almost every day during the past week. <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> has set all-time peaks 13 times this summer, said spokesman <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, the big federal utility, hit another record peak summer demand Tuesday of 21,304 megawatts. A record Monday of 20,618 megawatts forced the utility to buy about 2,500 megawatts from neighboring utilities, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, senior vice president of power for <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION>'s all-time power peak was in the winter of 1983 at 22,478 megawatts.

 Former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said Tuesday that Democratic chants of `` Where Was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' unfairly distorted and belittled <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s accomplishments in a long career of government service. In a speech to the Republican National Convention, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his experience and competence, saying, `` For 45 years <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been at the center of the action in the service of this great republic.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not deserve to have Democrats ask: `` Where Was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' The 38th president was joined at the lectern by his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, who said she was delighted to work to send <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` to the White House where they belong.'' The convention was a half hour behind schedule when <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> began and many of the delegates had already left the hall. But the television networks, who had been scheduled to end their coverage at 11 p.m. EDT, stayed with the convention. Obviously stung by the chanted question at last month's Democratic convention when Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., questioned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s influence in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> offered this retort: `` I'll be damned if I will stand by and let anyone with a smirk and a sneer discredit the honor, service, accountability and competence of <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` If the three Democratic standard-bearers in this campaign think it is about competence,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said, `` let any one of them _ or all three of them put together _ top the demonstrated competence of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The former president was referring to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and former presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Ford accused the Democrats of attempting to steal the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream at their convention _ a dream he said belongs to the nation and all of its people. `` No party, no politician has a patent on our dream,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream belongs to you and nobody can take it away from you.'' In an echo of his losing campaign against <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1976, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> asked his audience, `` Do we really want to go back to the days of spend and spend and tax and tax _ of a government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with its head in the clouds and its hand in your pocket? `` I can put it no plainer than this: This year's Democratic ticket is a tax increase waiting to happen,'' he said. In a backhanded slap at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was `` pretty solid on defense matters.'' Rhetorically addressing <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said: `` Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says you'll be the kind of vice president who will march into the Oval Office and tell him: ` Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, that is a perfectly ridiculous policy.''' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> added, `` Lloyd, with all the differences between the Democratic leaders, why wait? Speak up now.''

 A `` swat'' team is out to attack a bat problem. But the specials weapons in this case are tennis rackets, brooms and nightsticks, which police are using to swat the flying creatures in a running battle with them. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Brotherton </PERSON> bagged a bat early Sunday and said it was the 10th bat call city police have gotten in five days. <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegner </PERSON> had fallen asleep watching TV and awoke to see her dog's head going back and forth as it watched a bat circle the living room. She called police. `` I'm petrified of bats,'' she said. `` It seemed to like where I was sleeping, so I grabbed a blanket and waited on the porch. I was wearing my pajamas.'' When <PERSON> Brotherton </PERSON> arrived, he turned on the lights to coax the bat to sleep. The bat landed on a wall where <PERSON> Brotherton </PERSON> pinned it with his nightstick. The bat slid into a paper bag, he said. `` Usually at night they keep flying, and you have to pin them with a broom or swat them with a tennis racket,'' he said. `` Normally I can get them by the third swing.''

 The bride wore white lace, the groom wore a top hat, and both had tails. But that was OK, for the wedding was for the dogs. When <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fruitport </LOCATION> bought a female Pomeranian puppy, Foxy Lady, to breed with their 5-year-old male Pomeranian, Tiny, their daughter thought something was amiss. `` My 10-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Majorie </PERSON>, thought that they should be married before they had puppies, so we decided to go ahead and do it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> said. And as long as there was going to be a wedding, Mrs. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> figured it should be done right. She rented a tuxedo for Tiny and a dress for Foxy, decorated the front porch with flowers and invited neighborhood children to Saturday's ceremony. The bride and groom were led by leash to the altar to the tune of the `` Wedding March,'' and Mrs. <PERSON> McGregor </PERSON> performed the ceremony.

<DATELINE>NEVE DEKALIM, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jewish settlers are digging in their heels, determined to stay in this seaside strip even in the face of resurgent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> violence that led the army to clamp an indefinite curfew. They say they are drawn by an improved quality of life in their tiny, closeknit communities and a pioneering spirit. But heightened violence in the Israeli-occupied territory has taken its toll. Six Israelis leaving <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekalim </PERSON> after a visit this week were injured in a firebomb attack. From the settlement, Israelis can often see tires burning and hear gunfire in the nearby <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> refugee camp. Jewish settlers here, however, say they will not be frightened away. `` We must not let the situation change the normal course of our lives. That's just what the Arabs want,'' <PERSON> Shimshon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahilker </PERSON>, a 21-year-old seminary student, said in an interview Tuesday. The Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation began in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> eight months ago and tensions have remained high. Of the more than 240 Palestinians killed in the rebellion, about a third were in the strip. Four Israelis also have died. About 2,000 Jewish settlers share <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> with 650,000 Palestinians, about two-thirds of whom are refugees living in poverty in overcrowded camps. If the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> is a hurricane, then the Jewish settlements are its eye. <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekalim </PERSON> could be a pleasant suburb if one forgot its location. Some families in this settlement about a mile from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> live in homes with manicured lawns and palm trees. Whereas the Arabs have been confined round-the-clock to their homes during a curfew that began Sunday night, the small community of Jewish settlers in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> can come and go as they please. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasa </PERSON> sat outside the municipal building selling plastic chairs, coolers and umbrellas for the beach. Security concerns, however, are prevalent. <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekalim </PERSON> is circled by barbed wire fences and regularly patroled by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. An armed soldier rode in the front seat of a bus bringing settlers home. `` Two weeks ago I was driving with my children in a car and someone threw a gigantic rock which broke the window,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizur </PERSON>, a 28-year-old teacher and mother of three who moved to <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekalim </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> two weeks ago. `` Immediately after that we saw a burning tire blocking the road. It was a frightening drive. I shook all over,'' she said. But Mrs. <PERSON> Elizur </PERSON> said she had no intention of leaving `` because the settlement offers me the kind of life I want.'' `` It's wonderful for children,'' agreed <PERSON> Sima </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmaliach </PERSON>, 28. `` They have an excellent religious education.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Elmaliach </PERSON> said the latest firebomb attack troubled her, `` but we very much believe in God, and we believe that if something has to happen to somebody, it will happen anywhere.'' Far fewer settlers live in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> than in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has suggested resolving the Palestinian conflict by giving up the strip in return for a negotiated settlement. But <PERSON> Bini </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiesel </PERSON>, a settler who has lived here for 3 -LCB- years, opposes any such solution. `` The numbers do n't matter,'' said the 32-year-old music teacher and father of six. `` The question is whether we have a right to live in our country _ all of it. Any Arab who accepts that can stay, and those who do n't should leave.'' <PERSON> Elyada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yovel </PERSON>, a 14-year-old from <PERSON> Neve </PERSON> <PERSON> Dekalim </PERSON>, also opposes moving. He said he never thinks of the rebellion on busy schooldays, `` but on Saturdays, we go up on the hill to see the action. We hear shooting in the refugee camp.'' `` But I still go to the beach'' near the refugee camp, he said. `` What's there to be afraid of? Where could you find such quality of life, except in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>?''

<HEAD>U.N. Panel Votes For Investigation Of Romanian's Disappearance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> human rights panel voted Monday to have the secretary-general investigate the case of a Romanian specialist who disappeared without completing a report on youth and human rights. <PERSON> Dumitru </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON> had been given a mandate by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommission </ORGANIZATION> on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to present a report to the panel's current meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. In a letter sent to the subcommission last April and distributed by members, <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON> said the Romanian government had pressured him to drop the study, forced him to retire from a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> post, confiscated his passport and put him under police surveillance. By a vote of 16-2, the subcommission asked Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to inform <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s communist authorities of the `` urgent need to establish personal contact'' with <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON> and to report back by Wednesday. The motion, sponsored by the French and Norwegian delegates, also urged <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to establish <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON>'s whereabouts and arrange a visit to him by a member of the subcommission. Romanian officials told the subcommision that <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON> could not complete the report or attend the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting because of a heart condition. They said <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON> recently left <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, the Romanian capital, to undergo treatment at a health resort, but they did not identify the resort. After several days of debate the motion was passed with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> voting against it, four delegates abstaining and three not voting. Soviet delegate <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernichenko </PERSON> said the case was an administrative matter that had `` nothing to do with human rights'' and the subcommission had overstepped its mandate by attempting to give <PERSON> Mazilu </PERSON> `` quasi-diplomatic status.''

<HEAD>AIDS 15th Among Causes of Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 AIDS would rank as the 15th leading cause of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it were counted as a separate category, according to new figures from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome killed between 12,450 and 13,820 Americans last year, the center estimated in its first annual summary including separate figures for the disease. While AIDS has not yet been added to the rankings of major causes of death published by the agency, the 1987 toll would have placed it 15th on the list, ahead of birth defects, the agency noted. The center's annual summary of vital statistics also disclosed that in 1987, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had the most births in nearly 25 years and the most deaths ever, and that marriage and divorce rates were at the lowest level in more than a decade. The report said that 65 percent of AIDS victims were white males and 25 percent black males with between 4 percent and 5 percent each being black and white females. The age groups most affected were 25 to 34 and 35 to 44, the study added. AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The disease is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from infected pregnant women to their offspring. The chief victims have been homosexual men and intravenous drug users. As of Aug. 8, AIDS had been diagnosed in 70,208 Americans, of whom more than half, or 39,620, have died, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. A slight increase in fertility, coupled with the huge number of women in their prime childbearing years, resulted in the estimated 3,829,000 babies born last year, the most since 1964, the report showed. Millions of people born in the post World War II Baby Boom are now in their 20s and 30s and, after completing school and launching careers, have begun families. That has led to a sharp increase in total births in recent years, although the nation's fertility rate of 66.1 births per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44 remains about half that of the late 1950s when the Baby Boom was at its peak. Social scientists have begun referring to the recent surge as an `` echo'' of the Baby Boom. Deaths in 1987 totaled 2,127,000, up from 2,099,000 a year earlier and the most ever recorded for a single year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Record numbers of deaths have become common in recent years as the nation's population includes an ever larger share of elderly people. The national death rate of 8.7 per 1,000 people in 1987 was unchanged from a year earlier, the report noted. Life expectancy at birth also was unchanged at 74.9 years. The report disclosed small increases in life expectancy last year for white men and black women, and small declines for white women and black men. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> of the center's mortality branch said statisticians wo n't be able to determine a reason for those changes until they have more time to study the detailed figures. Among causes of death, heart disease declined somewhat last year, as it has for the last several years, the report found. There also was a decline in the rate for accidents, other than those involving motor vehicles. Death rates for other major causes of death did not show statistically significant changes. The nation's marriage rate for 1987 was 9.9 weddings per 1,000 people, the lowest since 1977 when it was also 9.9. Divorce also was low last year, at a rate of 4.8 per 1,000 people, the lowest since 1975. It peaked at 5.3 in 1979 and again in 1981. Here is a rundown of the estimated number of deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year for the 15 leading causes. AIDS is included under the category of `` all other infectious and parasitic diseases,'' which showed a growth in deaths from 9,030 in 1986 to 19,160 last year, but such `` all other'' generalized categories were not part of the ranking system.

<HEAD>Clutter Of Signals Obscures Heavens For Radio Astronomers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Electromagnetic clatter from millions of manmade sources is drowning out whispers from the heavens and crippling research by radio astronomers who probe distant stars, scientists say. <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, a radio astronomer at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, says the machines of modern <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ from car engines, to computers, to automatic garage door openers _ are helping to pollute the airwaves with electromagnetic garbage. `` The radio spectrum is a natural resource and, as with any natural resource, it can get polluted,'' Price said in an interview while attending an astronomy conference Monday. `` It's not like air or water pollution because you ca n't see it, but it's there.'' For that reason, he said, astronomers are anxious that unnecessary uses of radio signals be eliminated. In many cases, gross radio interference sources could be controlled with the use of filters or shields that would add only a dollar or two to manufacturing costs, he said. `` The radio spectrum is a vital part of our everyday life,'' said Price. `` Every time you order a pizza or call for an ambulance, it's probably radio dispatched and there's another signal. That's why we worry about this limited resource being used for frivolous purposes.'' Electromagnetic gridlock is only one type of pollution affecting astronomers. At a meeting this week sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, astronomers from around the world said their work also is hampered by manmade light, and by debris left in space that reflects sunlight and causes streaks on astronomy photographs. For radio astronomers, the electromagnetic spectrum can help unlock secrets of star formation millions of light years away. Each type of molecule, when excited by heat, puts out a unique radio signal. By capturing and analyzing these signals, radio astronomers can determine the chemical composition of processes taking place at points in the universe not even visible to optical telescopes. This work has defined the shape of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s home galaxy, discovered key components in the lives of stars, and confirmed formation of complex chemicals within galaxies and stars. Radio astronomers explore virtually every portion of the spectrum to catch the faint, distant star symphony, but <PERSON> Price </PERSON> said continuation of this work is threatened now by the sudden rise of manmade radio signals. `` In the last five years, we've seen an explosion of use of the radio spectrum for consumer devices,'' he said. Many of these signals could be shielded from the environment. Spark plugs in automobiles, for instance, he said, create a slight radio signal every time they fire. This could be corrected for about $ 2 per vehicle, said Price. Cellular telephones, computers, handheld calculators and electronic toys all add to the clutter, he said, and all could be filtered and shielded for small cost. Price said radar signals used for defense, air traffic control and even highway speed-checking guns all put out signals in portions of the spectrum important to astronomy. So do television stations. A new Soviet navigation system is threatening to blot out study of the hydroxyl radical, a key part of the chemistry of water and of some organic chemicals. Research on this molecule could give important clues to the existence of life beyond the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Radio astronomers are able to detect the hydroxyl radical at 1600 to 1700 megahertz on the spectrum. A system of navigation satellites now being deployed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would operate constantly at this same portion of the radio band. `` It is impossible to study this molecule when they -LRB- the satellites -RRB- are above your horizon,'' he said. The strong Soviet navigation signal simply blots out everything else in that portion of the spectrum, said Price. `` Eventually, the navigation system will cover the whole Earth and we could lose the ability to study the hydroxyl radical,'' he said. `` This robs you of considerable information.'' Price said astronomers recognize that little can be done to control the growing use of the spectrum for important services such as aircraft control and communications. But the scientists hope that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the world community will take measures to control the `` unnecessary and frivolous use of a diminishing resource.'' And, Price said, astronomers recognize that eventually they'll have to leave the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and its cacophony of electronic noise, if they are to continue studying the dim electronic voice of the universe But where would they go? `` The backside of the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> has been designated as a quiet zone,'' he said. `` It would be shielded against the signals from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. That's about our only choice.''

 Millions of Americans with adjustable mortgages and other variable-rate loans are in for further shocks this year if the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> keeps up its anti-inflation campaign as many economists are predicting. Many Americans already have seen their credit costs rise this year because of credit tightening on the part of the central bank. As <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers gathered to map monetary strategy behind closed doors today, some economists were predicting that the central bank already has decided that even higher rates are necessary to slow an economy being buffeted by rising inflationary threats. The meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> comes one week after the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, in a surprise move, boosted its discount rate by one-half percentage point to 6.5 percent, its highest level since July 1986. An increase in the discount rate, the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges to make loans to commercial banks, is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send of its intention to push interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and thus fighting inflationary pressures. The timing of the discount rate increase was a surprise for many economists who had expected the all-Republican <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board, led by Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, to shy away from such an overt credit-tightening move in an election year. While analysts said they do n't expect another boost in the discount rate until after the November election, they said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> very likely will continue tightening credit by more subtle means. Since late March, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been reducing the reserves banks have available for making loans, driving up a variety of short-term interest rates. The federal funds rate, which is the interest banks charge to make overnight loans to each other, has now risen to 8 percent and many economists predicted it would climb by another one-half percentage point in coming weeks. Major banks followed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s lead last week and boosted their prime lending rate from 9.5 percent to 10 percent, a three-year high. Analysts predicted that with further <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> pressure, the prime rate will climb to 10.5 percent in the next two months. `` I am looking for further tightening steps based on a perception by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers that the economy is growing too strongly,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer. Because the prime rate is used to calculate a wide range of consumer loans, from adjustable mortgages to home equity loans, the rate hikes will be felt quickly by consumers, analysts said. They also predicted further increases in traditional fixed-rate mortgages. A national survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said fixed-rate mortgages jumped to 10.57 percent at the end of last week, up almost a percentage point from their February low. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said fixed-rate mortgages will hit 11 percent within a month with the only question being how much higher they may go before the end of the year. `` The economy has a tremendous head of steam, particularly in the industrial sector,'' he said. `` History has shown us that once our economy develops boom-like conditions, it takes tougher restrictive policies to bring accelerating inflation under control.'' Analysts pointed to a variety of recent statistics which indicate inflation is a growing problem. The government reported last week that wholesale prices shot up at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in July, compared with an increase of 2.2 percent in 1987. Some economists predicted that consumer prices could be climbing at a 6 percent annual rate within six months. And on Monday, the government said industrial output climbed 0.8 percent in July, the biggest increase since last October and an advance which put further strains on many industries already operating at close to top capacity. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> does n't continue to tighten in this environment, at least in a moderate way, then it will have to tighten two or three times as much if it waits and inflation gets more out of hand,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will wait awhile before it takes any further tightening moves. `` I think they wanted to send a signal to the markets last week that inflation was their top priority,'' he said. `` Now that they have done that, they will lay back on their oars and see how the economy develops in the third quarter.'' Many economists are predicting that overall economic growth, as measured by the gross national product, will slow somewhat in the last half of the year, compared with an annual rate of increase of 3.3 percent in the first half of 1988.

 The drought has brought mixed results to farm machinery sales this year, although preliminary readings by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> show that crop expansion plans for 1989 could have some effect. Spending on farm machinery rose in 1987 after seven years of decline to $ 5.77 billion from $ 4.61 billion in 1986, according to a report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Currently, largely because of brisk sales early in the year, the agency forecasts 1988 machinery expenditures may range from $ 5.7 billion to $ 6.2 billion. `` The farm machinery industry will be hurt if farmers with reduced cash receipts put off buying new equipment,'' the report said. `` Demand for harvesting, drying and storage equipment is most likely to be affected.'' However, the report added that the drought has prompted greater sales of irrigation equipment in some parts of the country. Farm machinery sales rose to a record of almost $ 12 billion in 1979 before staring a 60 percent slide to $ 4.61 billion in 1986, reflecting the crunch on farm income, high interest rates and tight credit in the early 1980s. Analysts said last year's improved sales stemmed from `` enhanced financial conditions for farmers'' in 1987, notably a record net cash income nationwide of $ 56 billion. Net cash income _ the difference between gross cash receipts and cash expenses _ is forecast at $ 53 billion to $ 59 billion this year. Despite the drought, analysts said there are some good signs: farmland values as of February were up 3 percent, on the average, from a year earlier, and total farm debt is at its lowest level since 1979. `` Higher interest rates and drought likely will repress some demand for machinery in the remainder of 1988, but sales are still likely to rise,'' the report said. Drought in the Corn Belt and spring wheat states probably will hurt machinery sales because of reduced cash flow to pay bills or take on new debt. `` However, those farmers who produce a crop will benefit from higher commodity prices,'' the report said. `` Farm machinery purchases not affected by the drought are expected to rise.'' Looking ahead at total `` input'' requirements, which includes machinery as well as other items for production, the report said prospects for spring planting in 1989 `` appear promising since the 1988 drought will reduce commodity stocks and increase commodity prices. This should increase planted acreage in 1989 and thereby increase input demand.''

 Higher grain prices are putting a crunch on cattle feeders and are helping to trim placement of cattle and calves in feedlots this summer, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. As of Aug. 1, cattle being fed for the slaughter market in the seven major beef states totaled 6.84 million head, up 2 percent from a year ago and 8 percent more than inventories of two years ago, the department said Monday. The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last month was reported at 1.25 million head, down 2 percent from a year ago and down 19 percent from two years ago. Marketings of `` fed'' cattle in July totaled 1.77 million head, up 4 percent from a year ago and also up 4 percent from two years ago. Officials said those were the most July feedlot marketings since the 7-state estimates began in 1972. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists, market prices of Choice steers on the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, market are expected to average $ 65 to $ 69 per 100 pounds this summer, compared with $ 72.81 in the April-June quarter. Prices are projected at $ 66 to $ 72 in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, drought has reduced grain production and sent prices higher, translating into higher cattle feeding costs. As it looks to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists, the forecasts of fed cattle prices are about $ 100 per head below break-even levels. As of Aug. 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year earlier in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> but were less in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The seven states produce about three-fourths of the nation's beef. State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Aug. 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

 The opening of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales last year was an encouraging development in a market historically dominated by <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, says a trade report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` Although it is likely that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will have a hard time maintaining a market presence -LRB- in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> -RRB- once Thai supplies return to normal, the sales last year provided an opportunity for Malaysian users to become more familiar with the qualities of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> product,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Hispanic FBI Agent Testifies Agency Turned Him Down for Nine

<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent testified Monday he was turned down for nine promotions because he is Hispanic and that the agency kept a dossier on his wife because she started <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Paso </PERSON>'s first rape crisis center <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> supervisory special agent <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> also testified that his supervisor told him he was the first choice for one job but was turned down because he was a subject of an investigation into alleged illegal arms sales to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. He denied any such dealings, and said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> found no evidence to support the charge. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> is among 311 Hispanic agents who have joined a class-action lawsuit before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>. The lawsuit contends the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> discriminates against Hispanics in hiring, promoting and disciplinary matters. The non-jury trial is expected to last two weeks and about 100 witnesses are expected to be called. The lawsuit was filed in January 1987 by <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Matt </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, assistant agent in charge of the El Paso office. From 1979 until 1982, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> worked at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, office _ a bureau considered an undesirable assignment by agents because of the island's high crime rate and isolation. Personnel Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rarity </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> testified the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> does not discriminate against Hispanics, and said Hispanic agents are transferred to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> because they are more likely than other agents to speak Spanish. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said he was heavily pressured into applying for a transfer from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. After two months in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, he was transferred to isolated <LOCATION> Aguadilla </LOCATION> on the island's northwest coast. After five years there, <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> was transferred to <LOCATION> Gallup </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> _ officially listed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as a hardship office because of the town's isolation and quality of life. <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> said the last time he was turned down for a promotion was after the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> became aware he was participating in the lawsuit.

 It took lots of drinking water and wet towels, but <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Fordin </PERSON> weathered a broiling, shadeless afternoon to be first in line Monday night for a candlelight procession past <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>'s grave. `` It's an honor to be first, and to look back and see all those candles lit is just unbelievable,'' said Ms. Cousins, 37, of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The gates to <PERSON> Graceland </PERSON>, Presley's former <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> residence, opened at 10:30 p.m. for the procession expected to draw more than 5,000 fans marking the 11th anniversary of the singer's death. Ms. Cousins and Ms. <PERSON> Fordin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> took up their position at the Graceland gates at noon and waited through a humid afternoon with a high of 99 degrees. `` The thing is not to dehydrate,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Fordin </PERSON>, 37. `` I love <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>. He will live forever in our hearts,'' she said. `` I bought an Elvis pillowcase and I ca n't wait to sleep on it.'' Presley died of heart disease at <LOCATION> Graceland </LOCATION> on Aug. 16, 1977, and the faithful return each year to mark the anniversary. With Presley recordings playing in the background, the fans queued up at the Graceland gates, touched candles to a torch lighted by an eternal flame and walked single file up a winding, 200-yard driveway past the singer's grave. `` It helps keep his memory alive,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Gnadenhutten </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who sported an Elvis pompadour and a 6-inch-wide leather belt with dangling loops of chain. Before joining the procession, <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON> signed autographs and posed for pictures with other fans at a souvenir shopping center across the street from Graceland. `` It's just something to look back on,'' said <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarrants </PERSON>, 26, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, who had her picture taken with <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON>. `` And besides, <PERSON> Mama </PERSON> said to take a lot of pictures.'' <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, his mother, father and paternal grandmother are buried beside the swimming pool at Graceland in a small plot called `` Meditation Garden.'' The garden was covered with stands of flowers sent by fans, and many participants in the candlelight vigil carried flowers to leave at the grave. Presley originally was buried at a cemetery three miles from Graceland, but his body and his mother's were moved to the garden in October 1977. The singer's father and grandmother died after the grave site was established. No one takes a count of participants in the annual graveside procession which lasts into the early hours of Aug. 16, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Soden </PERSON>, Graceland manager. `` The estimates have always ranged from 5,000 to 10,000. I just do n't know -LRB- how many take part -RRB-, but I would say at least several thousand,'' he said. Many fans are upset this year by a recently published book called `` Is Elvis Alive?'' The book includes claims that Presley staged his death. `` It's a sad and cruel exploitation,'' <PERSON> Soden </PERSON> said. `` We've endured a lot of tasteless exploitation over the last 11 years. Graceland draws more than 600,000 tourists a year and for the past six years, <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fans have been offered a nine-day series of events each August called `` Elvis International Tribute Week.''

<HEAD>GOP Speechwriters Ready To Write `Generic' Veep Speech</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Even before <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his choice of a running mate, aides were preparing to craft the words the mystery person will say while accepting the nomination. Speechwriters planned to write a `` generic'' speech that would be tailored at the last minute to fit the running mate, along with similar speeches to place that name in nomination. The name can be filled in later. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention manager, said the draft speeches would set out broad themes the campaign wants to stress on the convention's closing night, with the running mate to polish the language later. `` By Wednesday morning ... we will have one or two writers working on a generic kind of acceptance speech which the nominee would then have to take and modify and put into his or her own style of words,'' said <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>. Organizers of the convention are orchestrating even the smallest detail in an effort to put on a polished television performance. Each speech delivered from the podium is reviewed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speechwriters, who edit and revise it to fit that evening's chosen theme and to squeeze it into allotted time limits <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> insisted they need a head start on the running mate's Thursday speech to have the time necessary to prepare such a high-profile address `` It's a generic kind of a speech, it's a draft,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. `` The nominee will not learn of his or her selection until Thursday morning.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he wo n't reveal his selection until Thursday morning, only hours before that candidate must deliver the prime-time acceptance speech. In addition, organizers will be scrambling to line up another luminary to nominate the No. 2 candidate and still others to second the nomination and make the introduction. `` We've got two other, three other addresses, really, to go along with it,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. `` They will be also in the same sequence. We'll have one or two writers working on an acceptance speech and another working on a nominating speech. `` We wo n't start this until Wednesday,'' he said. `` They will have no clues, nor will I, on who it's going to be.'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said he would have been happier with more time for writers to work on the speech, but that it's not his decision. `` A good writer, with some general directions and general clues, can get a running start,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. He said organizers have n't decided yet who will give the nominating speeches, but `` we are developing some ideas of who are good speakers and could do it.'' Part of the problem, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said, is that not only must those picked to introduce the vice presidential nominee be good speakers, they must also have some logical connection to the new candidate, or to the campaign theme that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signals with the pick. `` I think it's going to be all right, I think we have the caliber of people to do the nomination,'' he said. `` I do n't have any great trepidations about that. Obviously they could do a better job with more time.''

 It was n't exactly love at first sight. They are, after all, both conservatives. But what started as rhetoric blossomed into romance for <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kukuk </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> delegate, and <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Rungtranont </PERSON>, who was for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. They met following a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Republican convention, exchanged phone numbers at a delegates meeting, and courted at a <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> conference. What better place to pop the question, <PERSON> Kukak </PERSON> thought, than at the biggest shindig of them all, the Republican National Convention? The mingling of love and politics in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> seemed especially fitting to <PERSON> Kukuk </PERSON>, inspired as he was by the nation's first married vice presidential prospects, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> And so it came to pass, on a <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> riverboat, with jazz music playing softly in the background and the entire <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> delegation on board, that <PERSON> Kukuk </PERSON>, a 51-year-old township supervisor, picked <PERSON> Rungtranont </PERSON>, a 45-year-old college registrar, to be his running mate. They'll be tying the knot in November, right after the election. They thought it best to wait; <LOCATION> Kukuk </LOCATION> is running for county commissioner. The morning after the big night, they strolled through the Superdome in matching Styrofoam campaign hats. There was no shortage of people taking the same walk in the same hats, but somehow, you just could n't miss them as they floated along bumping into the walls, each of them displaying a yard-and-a-half of teeth. `` When you get to be 51, you're so set in your ways,'' said <PERSON> Kukak </PERSON>, who's been single for 20 years. `` It gets harder and harder to find someone who'll put up with you.'' `` When you get to be 45, the odds of finding someone who's right for you diminish greatly,'' said his fiancee. `` I never thought I'd find the right man. She found him at a seafood restaurant just off the thruway. `` I stopped to eat on the way home from the state convention and in walked <PERSON> Al </PERSON>,'' she said. `` The place was empty except for us, and he figured out from the bumper stickers on my car where I'd been. My heart was n't going pitter-patter. But my heart was kind of curious.'' They met again at a delegates' meeting, where they arranged to attend the conservative conference. By this point, <PERSON> Rungtranont </PERSON>'s interest was no longer purely platonic `` I probably would n't have driven down to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> if I had n't been getting interested,'' she said. After the conference, they had dinner. They talked mostly of politics. Still, there was something other than hot air in the air. On Easter, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> made the 160-mile round trip from his home in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemens </LOCATION> to hers in <LOCATION> Caro </LOCATION>, where he met her three children. That clinched it. They have n't missed a weekend since. She had a feeling the proposal was coming. `` He dropped some pretty broad hints,'' she said. The `` hints'' included telling a reporter on board the boat that `` something big might happen tonight.'' Something did. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> took <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> to a quiet corner and presented her with a gold-and-diamond engagement ring. The rest of the delegation was off listening to the jazz musicians. `` All we heard was the flutter of the wind and the whoosh of the water,'' he said. That and the pitter-pat of their hearts.

 If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was born with a silver spoon in his mouth, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> was born with a whole place setting. But despite wealth, blue blood and <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> exterior, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> preaches a `` politics of inclusion'' unusual for his party. In promoting opportunities for the poor, workers, blacks and other minorities, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> has gotten Democrats to vote for him. The theme appears in <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s book, `` The Politics of Inclusion,'' and <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> will hit upon it in his keynote speech tonight at the Republican National Convention. Despite being a less-than-riveting speaker, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> was born to public life. He is the son of the late Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, a 20-term House member, and his ancestors include several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s first constitutional governor. Forebear <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> was a contemporary of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who appointed him first cashier of the Bank of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the family's influence is testified to by <ORGANIZATION> Kean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and the town of <LOCATION> Keansburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> first saw politics at his father's elbow. The boy commuted between the family's home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and their estate in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where he still lives with his wife and their three children. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and earned a master's degree in history from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He taught high school and later had a stint at running the family real-estate business. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> was elected to the state Assembly in 1967 and was picked its speaker in 1972 and 1973. He failed in his first bid to gain his party's gubernatorial nomination in 1977. But <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s election to the <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION> four years later, and his 1985 re-election make one of the state's most dramatic political tales. In 1981, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> emerged from a field of eight would-be <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governors to win the nomination by less than 40,000 votes. It was a landslide compared with what was to come. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> won a narrow victory in the general election over Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, eking out a win by 1,677 votes. <PERSON> Florio </PERSON> called for a recount, and both candidates set up transition teams in preparation for taking office. Weeks later, the recounted results confirmed <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s election by 1,797 votes, the smallest margin in state history. Four years later, voters retained <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> by the biggest-ever margin, with 70 percent of the vote and majorities in all but three of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s 567 municipalities. To accomplish the win, one aide said, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> attempted to tread every inch and shake every hand in his small but diverse state. As nervous aides fidgeted, the governor kept motorcades and planes waiting while stopping to answer every question his constant press following could come up with. With a style too awkward to be bogus, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> convinced voters he was for real. One staff members recalls a night when the governor tried to share a beer with his staff. But when the six-pack was passed, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> could n't figure out the screw-top bottles. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, 53, has repeatedly said his programs are aimed at creating opportunity both for business owners and workers, as well as the poor. It's a political theme not unlike that of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> has concentrated on the `` philosophy and history of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ a philosophy that allows Republicans to go beyond the country clubs and the suburbs,'' as he wrote in his book. Though mentioned as a possible <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> running mate, the moderate <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> has few admirers on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s far right. While loyal to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the governor breaks often and openly with the White House. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s most conservative members, has threatened to walk out on <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s speech because of the governor's ideologically impure stance on abortion. Though personally opposed, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> does not back a constitutional ban. Praise for <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> has come from unexpected places: <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, joking in 1986, said that, `` He's the best Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.''

 Former presidential candidate <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> on Monday called <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a `` diminutive clerk'' in a sharp and personal convention speech that drew an immediate disclaimer for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign. When <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s presidential star faded early, he declared his support for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. In his convention speech Monday, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and then, despite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts to dissuade him, delivered a strong attack against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> also compared the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a bat `` flying erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its navel in guano.'' In contrast, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represented `` safe and progressive change, safe in that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will build on the solid accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> workers were clearly unhappy with the tenor of <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s remarks `` We do n't think that was an appropriate sequence of words,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> convention manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>. `` That was <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s choice, it was n't ours. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said organizers of the convention, who carefully review every word spoken from the podium, first saw <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s speech nearly a week ago and tried to convince him to tone down the rhetoric. `` We definitely told him we did not think that was a good thing to do,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. `` At one point, I thought he agreed with us but then he slept on it and decided it was what he wanted to do.'' In orchestrating this week's convention, GOP leaders have carefully chosen a theme for each night, and have insisted they want to stay away from personal assaults on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Monday night's theme was to highlight the successes of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s criticism was echoed in somewhat milder terms by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> argued that there's a time and a place for harsh assaults and Monday's convention speech was neither. `` I do n't look upon that as the kind of campaign we would wage,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said. `` Those were his words and his choice,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Mrs. Dole Acknowledges Gender Gap, Asks Women To Have Open Mind</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, confronting <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s gender gap with women voters, is urging women to `` have an open mind'' and work with the party for changes in child care and other matters affecting the family One of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s potential running mates, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was cheered as she spoke to the Republican National Convention on Monday night about the `` freedom'' women had achieved through job programs during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. `` Good jobs, not bad jobs. Real work, not make work. That's our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away?'' she asked, as the convention hall responded with a resounding `` No!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> dealt head-on with one of the most troubling problems for the Republicans this year: polls show that female voters are disproportionately supporting Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Today's strong economy means stronger families, and we affirm the woman who chooses to work in the home,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who spent seven years working in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, including four years as secretary of transportation. `` But our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions of women,'' she said, `` and let me say to the women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: I respect the fact that some of you have questions. I also ask you to have an open mind.'' She said that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` incredible jobs machine'' has created more jobs for Americans, and two-thirds of the 17 million new jobs created since 1982 went to women. `` I ask you, women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, not just to support us. ... Work with us to change what needs to be changed,'' she said. `` The future belongs to our children, and child care is one of those changes.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has endorsed the concept of the $ 2.5 billion `` better child bill'' now pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which would provide aid and impose new regulations for child care programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to give $ 2.2 billion in tax credits to families earning less than $ 20,000 a year to help them pay for child care in any setting they wish. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` wants to march our kids lock step to a government institution where <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will set all the rules ... but people work part-time, full-time, night shift, day shift, swing shift. One size does not fit all,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has five children and 10 grandchildren, believes `` the parents should choose,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. She said he will `` give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> parents what they want _ child care supervised by people who share their values: in a community-based setting, a relative's or neighbor's home, a church-sponsored center, or by the mother or father who works full-time at home. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for seeking `` to paint over his liberal policies with pretty rhetoric.'' `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' convention speech was just like the Democrat platform, hedging on defense, hedging on taxes, hedging on spending. We're not running against -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. We're running against <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>,'' she said, in a play on words with the name of a cigarette brand.

 The politics of optimism is alive at the Republican National Convention. But in the case of some <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seats held by veteran Democrats, the odds against them are so long that some might call it wishful thinking. `` I am not a sacrificial goat,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> on Monday as he detailed his plans to defeat Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and score the `` upset of the century. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has represented <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the last quarter century and is considered virtually unbeatable. But <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, who is of <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> descent despite his Irish surname, was undeterred. `` I'm in it to win,'' <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said at a news conference in which 16 Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates were introduced. `` I'm hearing people saying that 25 years of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> are enough.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> businessman was equally optimistic. His opponent is Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> has n't been defeated since his first victory in 1958, 30 years ago. `` If you think I'm in this to lose, just watch on Nov. 8,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. Republican <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON>, a black former ambassador, was positively defiant as he roared his optimism that he will unseat Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., an entrenched Democrat in a normally Democratic state `` Start looking for a surprise,'' <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> said. `` If any of you people in the media want to get a head start on looking good in November, start writing that <PERSON> Keyes </PERSON> is going to win. We are going to prove Republicans can split any bloc, take any vote. `` That surprise is going to shake our state's one-party system to its very roots.'' Rep. <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>., announced his intention to defeat Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>., who under state law may run for re-election while he seeks the vice presidency as the running mate of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will fall off both horses he's trying to ride,'' <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, a broadcast executive and a <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, said one reason he is trying to defeat Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melcher </PERSON>, D-Mont., is that a Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate has not carried <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> for a century `` One Republican every 100 years is only fair,'' he said. <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> generally votes Democratic, but <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hustace </PERSON>, a teacher, social worker and rancher, said she intends to beat the trend and replace Sen. Spark <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, a senator since 1976. She called <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> the `` laziest member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' said he is noted primarily `` for taking constituents to lunch'' and said there is a rumor in the state that he is ill and will retire two years after winning re-election. She immediately added: `` This is not to be a negative campaign. It will be a positive campaign.'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON>, the executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alumni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is generally credited with having a relatively good chance to end the 28-year <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> career of Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, D-N. He assured reporters that `` we're not making age an issue.'' <PERSON> Strinden </PERSON> immediately added: `` But every time a story is written, it is immediately mentioned that my opponent is 80 years old.'' At the news conference, Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said that although races are too close to call in 12 to 15 of the 32 seats states at stake in November, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has an excellent chance of recapturing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, now held by the Democrats, 54-46 `` We think it is in the realm of reason,'' <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, whose work stretched the limits of the electric guitar and had an influence on musicians from blues to country-western, died Sunday night when he hanged himself in a jail cell, officials said Monday. He was 48. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, died after he was arrested on a charge of public drunkenness and placed alone in a receiving cell at the <ORGANIZATION> Fairfax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Peed </PERSON>. He was placed in the cell at about 10:55 p.m. Sunday and checked 10 minutes later. But when deputies made a second check at 11:16 p.m., <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> was found hanged with his shirt from a window grate, Peed said. `` <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> was known for making the guitar squeal and snarl, playing harmonics, a lot of innovative techniques,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>'s recording label, the Chicago-based Alligator Records. `` People like <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> owe him a debt of gratitude.'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> began playing in the early 1950s. An early influence was note-bending guitarist <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, who would go on to play with soul singer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> had his own band in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at 15. He went to <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, where he met rockabilly legend <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, who wrote and performed the hit single, `` Suzy Q.'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> toured and recorded with <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> the next two years, and in 1960 joined a Canadian group that included <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Danko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> and was the forerunner for `` The Band.'' He spent the next few years in a studio, backing singers as diverse as pop star <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> and country-western singer <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>. He left that work, formed another group and started playing the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area, where he became an underground favorite. <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> magazine discovered him in 1971, and its review of one of his performances said, `` <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> provides what may well be the best rock-guitar picking in the world.'' A public television documentary titled `` The Best Unknown Guitarist in the World,'' debuted soon afterward and <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> was signed to a contract with Polydor. He produced five albums, one of which, `` <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>'s Second Album,'' went gold. He moved to <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> and put out three albums, including his second gold. Between 1978 and 1985, <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> was largely a musical recluse. He released only one album during that stretch, but moved back into the recording studio on a regular basis in 1985.

 <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> readied himself for a prime-time convention speech by talking party unity while also tending to his own future in the party. `` I told them I want <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to win,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said after a closed-door meeting with supporters. `` I'm a young guy, I can wait eight years,'' he added as he scheduled meetings with important early states in the primary process. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign faltered early on, and he has since endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. During the meeting Monday night, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said that he urged backers to be `` good Republicans'' and that he will formally release his delegates later in the week. Most delegates who have remained loyal to <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> have indicated they will vote for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> asks. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> count gives <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> 88 delegates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has far more than the 1,139 delegates needed for nomination. But <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was moving aggressively to carve out a role in this week's convention. In addition to the usual circuit of television interviews and receptions, he scheduled meetings with delegations from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> launched his week with a downtown rally where he said he `` wo n't ever surrender'' the conservative views which formed the basis for his campaign. `` You and I got into the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> because we believe in principles,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told backers. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Elwell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> will focus on the immediate goal of pushing for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election during the convention. `` The message is for them to join him,'' she said. `` We're here working for unity. He -LRB- <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> -RRB- has pledged his full support.'' `` Let's go fight Democrats,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told backers. `` We're getting ready to show why Republicans should be elected next fall and why <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be elected the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' he said. Despite his weak showing in the primary season, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told backers there was `` marvelous cooperation'' on drafting the conservative platform. He sent a clear message that he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to run on that document. `` Though I withdrew as a candidate,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said, `` the ideas, the concepts, the principles, the standards that you and I have held aloft do not ever quit and they do n't ever surrender and we are going to continue to fight until we see victory in the nation for the things we believe in.'' While <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> was speaking, a small group of protesters shouted `` bigot go home'' and `` go back to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' There were a few tense exchanges with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> backers, but they were quickly diffused.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention generals said they tried but failed to dissuade former rival <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> from delivering a sharp, personal attack on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the convention's opening hours. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> referred to the Democratic presidential nominee on Monday as a `` diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.'' `` We do n't think that was an appropriate sequence of words,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> convention manager <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>. `` That was <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s choice, it was n't ours. For each of the four nights of this week's convention, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> and other organizers have carefully scripted a single theme they want to present to the television audience. They have tried to discourage variations. In addition, <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> has said he does not want to see personal assaults on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. In his speech, referring to both <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his running mate, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said: `` You have to admit <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was good theater. It was an off-Broadway revival of ` The Odd Couple,' starring the diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the tall stranger from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' He also compared the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a bat `` flying erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its navel in guano.'' In contrast, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represented `` safe and progressive change, safe in that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will build on the solid accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> workers were clearly unhappy with the tenor of <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s remarks <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said convention organizers first saw <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>'s speech nearly a week ago and tried to persuade him to tone down the rhetoric. `` We definitely told him we did not think that was a good thing to do,'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said. `` At one point, I thought he agreed with us, but then he slept on it and decided it was what he wanted to do.'' <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s criticism was echoed in somewhat milder terms by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> argued that there's a time and a place for harsh assaults but Monday's convention speech was neither. `` I do n't look upon that as the kind of campaign we would wage,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>GOP Delegates Reject Right-Wing Rebellion Over Veep</HEAD>

 Republican delegates are pressing their preferences for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential pick, but many have rejected the idea of a conservative rebellion if his choice fails to pass right-wing muster. With humor and at times with heat, dozens of delegates interviewed Sunday and Monday stressed that the ultimate choice is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s alone. Those who say otherwise, said Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, are `` kooks.'' If some conservatives want to withhold their support from a moderate <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, `` Let'em do it,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said. `` It's only a small handful of wackos. I do n't believe this is an ideological kind of thing.'' The issue of an ideological test for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate was broached by Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, who suggested that the ticket could lose core support if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selected an insufficiently conservative partner. Some delegates agreed. `` It had better be a conservative,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Elmore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION> `` I want a conservative vice president,'' insisted <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Nuttle </PERSON> said he would be happy with Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, whose conservative credentials <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> had questioned. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, moreover, was backed Monday by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, one of the most conservative <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary candidates. `` The label you apply to a running mate is irrelevant,'' said Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, who withdrew his name from consideration last week. Another of those considered by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, stressed unity: `` Our duty is to stand up with the team.'' Delegates said one reason they left the choice to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was their faith he would choose well. `` Do you think <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is out there looking for an abortionist liberal who wants to raise taxes?'' asked former state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCamp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. `` You do n't want a foolish pick,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lungren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, `` but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't going to make a foolish pick.'' Their confidence in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aside, delegates were unabashed about promoting their favorites: Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or former U.N. Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> as conservative thinkers; <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as a help in farm states; <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, ex-Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, as a proven administrator. Some supporters of <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said their selection could boost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support among women. `` We have a gender gap, and we Republicans had better deal with it,'' said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Adeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Geo-Karis </PERSON>. `` The ticket needs something to give it pep, something that would help the weak spots,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Baar </PERSON> <PERSON> Topinka </PERSON>, also of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Others, though, cautioned that choosing a woman could be seen as tokenism and that compatibility should outweigh strategy. `` You would be better served to pick somebody you really want to serve with for eight years than to pick somebody that you think's going to pick up one or two votes,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. One reason for the long view, <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and others said, is that the choice of the vice presidential nominee, while enticing fodder for the convention rumor mill, is likely to have little effect on the presidential race. `` My hope is that we do n't get so wrapped up with vice president that we lose sight of the issues,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. `` The real question is who's going to be the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englanders </LOCATION> cut back on power to avert threatened blackouts, New Yorkers slept in Central Park to cool off and grain futures soared on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> Monday amid speculation that the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> would continue to bake in triple-digit heat. Temperatures and power usage reached record highs in the eastern half of the nation as a heat wave continued its weeks-long stranglehold from <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Record high temperatures were broken in 20 states and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, where it reached a sweltering 103 degrees, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. All 48 contiguous states had temperatures of 87 degrees or higher. Hundred-degree temperatures were in 22 states, and in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> reached 114 degrees and <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> hit 112 degrees. Raising thermostats, lowering lighting and other voluntary conservation measures by homes and businesses meant <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> utilities did not have to impose rotating blackouts, which they had predicted might be necessary to save power. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheperdson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>'s electricity usage, said power demand appeared to be somewhat below the record set last Thursday. Lexington-based <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s larger energy consumers, cut back 8.5 percent by turning down the air conditioning and shutting off non-essential equipment. But the high technology and weapons manufacturer did so grudgingly. `` We're not capable of trimming back our power demand without cutting back on production,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, a senior vice president, who said his office was `` 80 degrees, if not 90.'' The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> closed down for the day because of power drain. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which hit a record high of 97 Monday, a <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said utility customers used more than 10,000 megawatts of electricity for the first time in history. Con Ed said more than 13,000 customers lost power Monday night on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and more than half still were in the dark about 11:30 p.m. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Liipfert </PERSON> said weak links in the utility's heavily burdened delivery system caused power to fail earlier in the day in parts of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Before power there was restored about 7:30 p.m., police brought generators and fans to cool the lobbies of powerless high-rises, and air-conditioned buses were parked outside to provide a refuge for residents. A power outage in Grand Central Terminal was quickly restored as the evening rush hour began, but not before a handful of trains were delayed or canceled. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Raley </PERSON> said workers had not determined if the power failure was heat-related. Some people have been escaping hot apartments by staying all night in Central Park, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Tier </PERSON>, supervisor for the north end of the park. However, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Poirier </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> meteorologist, offered a glimmer of hope. He said a weak cold front was expected to move through the area by Tuesday, bringing highs in the low 90s instead of pushing 100 as in the past few days. In parts of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> the mercury surpassed the century mark. <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> reached 102 degrees, breaking the record of 101 set in 1886. Other record highs Monday included 97 at <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; 99 at <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; 101 in downtown <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and 98 at the airport; 99 at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; 97 at <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; 96 at <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>; 97 at <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; 102 at <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; 98 at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; 97 at <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; 99 at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>; and 97 at <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del High school football coaches around <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> took care to monitor their athletes for heat-related stress as they ran through conditioning drills. `` You watch them to make sure they're sweating,'' said <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON> North Coach <PERSON> Cy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who said his two-hour afternoon practices would be cut back 30 minutes. Grain and soybean futures posted their strongest gains in a week Monday in response to predictions that crops in the drought-weary Corn Belt would bake for most of this week. Monday's midday weather forecasts, coming on the heels of a hot, mostly dry weekend in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, stoked fears of further damage to the crops and helped push most corn, oat and soybean contracts up their permitted daily limits on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Seven weekend heat-related deaths in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> have brought the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> total to 28 since the record-breaking heat wave began, county officials said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in an emotional valedictory speech to the Republican National Convention, told cheering delegates Monday that contrary to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> claims, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` was there.'' To his vice president, he said, `` Win one for the Gipper.'' Acknowledging the tumultuous reception, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared, `` Nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates in this hall, except maybe a victory celebration on Nov. 8,'' the president said. `` In this spirit,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the delegates, `` I think we could be forgiven if we give ourselves a little pat on the back for having made <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> a proud word again and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a proud nation again.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, praised by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a man `` who has seen this office from the inside,'' watched the president's speech on television at the vice presidential residence in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He will arrive in the convention city Tuesday, one day before his coronation as the Republican presidential nominee. After <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a statement, `` It was a great and generous speech by a great and generous president. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I were very touched and very moved. Now I will go to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, spell out my message for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and do my level best to fill the big shoes of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' The president spoke forcefully, generally in serious tones. There was an occasional scratchiness in his voice. But there were lighter moments, too, such as when he invoked his old movie career to urge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to victory. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final words, `` God bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' touched off a tumultuous demonstration on the floor, which erupted in even greater cheering as he was joined on the podium by the first lady. In the climax of the evening, red, white and blue balloons were released from the Superdome ceiling, and the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> playfully swatted them around the podium and into the swell of delegates. Blue, white and red `` Bush'88'' signs were hoisted into the air, and one delegate sported a `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for VP'88'' placard. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still has not made known his choice for a running mate. Seeking to counter the `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' cry that became a theme of the Democratic National Convention, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the convention, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> played a major role in everything that we've accomplished. When he belted out the line, `` And <PERSON> George </PERSON> was there,'' the crowd roared back, `` Four more years, four more years.'' He then ticked off a list of administration successes, from the economic recovery to the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate medium-and short-range nuclear weapons. `` Without <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to build on those policies, everything we have achieved will be at risk,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` We need someone who's big enough and experienced enough to handle tough and demanding negotiations with ... -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ because this is no time to gamble with on-the-job training.'' It was clear who <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was referring to, although he did not mention by name the Democratic presidential nominee, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. There was a brief chant of `` <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'' from the crowd after the president declared that `` in the 2,765 days of our administration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the Communists.'' There was a chorus of booing when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> predicted that if the Democrats win the election `` their answer will be the one they have relied on in the past _ and that is higher taxes.'' In domestic policy, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` we set out to reduce federal regulations that had been imposed on the people, on businesses, and on local and state governments.'' `` And <PERSON> George </PERSON> was there,'' he said of the Republican presidential nominee-in-waiting. `` He headed up the task force that eliminated those regulations.'' `` So, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, I'm in your corner,'' he said. Then, invoking a movie line that has become one of his political trademarks, the president said, `` But <PERSON> George </PERSON>, just one personal request: go out there and win one for the Gipper.'' He grinned broadly. The president insisted on the timing of his convention speech _ on opening night _ to avoid stealing the spotlight from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his vice president are scheduled to meet only once in this convention city, at a ceremonial passing of the baton at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> airport Tuesday when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrives for his coronation and the president and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> depart for a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> preceded her husband on the podium. Her brief remarks were followed by a film highlighting the key moments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the delegates: `` I'm grateful to God for blessing me with a good life and a long one. But when I pack my bags in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, do n't expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life.'' `` Together, we've fought for causes we love,'' he said. `` But we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight, because the battle is never over.'' And he used a reference to his beloved Rancho del Cielo to describe what lies ahead for the nation. `` There's still a lost of brush to clear out at the ranch, fences that need repair and horses to ride.'' The president said his administration was able to forge ahead on both the international and domestic fronts `` in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it's time for a change. `` They resisted our defense buildup; they resisted our tax cuts; they resisted cutting the fat out of government; and they resisted our appointments of judges committed to the law and the Constitution.'' `` Facts are stubborn things,'' the president said repeatedly, declaring that it was his administration that led the country into its longest peacetime economic expansion and reversed Democratic policies that produced `` gas lines as well as unemployment lines.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opened his speech by telling the delegates that he and the first lady wanted `` to share a little of your special time.'' `` Having temporary custody of this office has been for me a sacred trust and an honor beyond words or measure,'' he said. Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made a surprise appearance at a luncheon given in honor of the first lady. `` I really ca n't imagine these last eight years without <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` Every president should be so lucky.'' `` She once said that the president has all kinds of advisers and experts to look after his interests when it comes to foreign policy, the economy or whatever, but no one to look after his needs as a human being,'' he said. `` Well, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> has done that.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, clearly surprised at the president's appearance and moist-eyed at the tribute, put her arms around him as he spoke and as they joined the audience in singing, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the Beautiful.'' She told the luncheon that the years she and her husband spent in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> were `` eight of the most wonderful years we have ever had.'' But, she added, `` Today the curtain begins to close on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era of the Republican party. We have had a wonderful run, but today it is time for the Bushes to step into the political leading roles and for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to step into the wings.''

 The man held a 3-foot cross in one hand and a Bible in the other, but he managed to point a finger at a middle-aged man and tell him in that his $ 6.50 movie fare made him a candidate for damnation. `` You must be a child molester,'' the man with the cross called out. The subject of the protester's fury blushed and his friends huddled around him in the line to see `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' on its opening night last weekend. `` How many children have you molested?'' the man with the cross persisted, adding for emphasis, `` Pervert! Pervert!'' Our group of six knew in advance that plans to attend a screening of `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' would not be a typical night at the movies. Tickets were purchased six hours earlier and our arrival one hour before screening time put us far from the front of the long line. But the hour passed quickly as hundreds of people protesting the new film by director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON> provided a street show as colorful as that on the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> boardwalk. Some protesters passed out literature condemning the film's depiction of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as dreaming of evading his messianic role in order to live as a husband and father One pamphlet cover showed a bleeding thorn-crowned Christ under the word `` Blasphemy!'' Other demonstrators, however, took the opportunity to verbally attack movie patrons, calling them devil worshipers, fornicators and child molesters. One told a woman in line that if she went into the theater, she must be a lesbian. The woman replied: `` Then I guess I'm a lesbian.'' Many of those people in line applauded a young woman who wove through protesters holding high a sign that read: `` I Support Artistic Expression.'' A protester approached one man who applauded, called him an adulterer and said: `` You're the type of person who believes we came from monkeys.'' Earlier, a woman pushed a baby stroller through the plaza complex and paused to tell her little girl: `` See all these people in line? Well, they're all going to go to hell.'' Those who patronized the movie on opening day were, in effect, taking a stand, and for the most part swallowed the comments in stride. Twenty minutes after the film was supposed to begin, the sell-out crowd was let in to the theater, but not before guards checked bags for weapons and other items that might be used in vandalism. Guards stood by exits and sat at the front of the theater on either side of the screen. Seconds after the lights went down, the Universal Pictures logo appeared on the screen. Patrons in the 600-seat auditorium applauded, and clapped again when <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s name appeared. Few people left before the two-hour, 40 mimute film ended, and most managed to escape the onslaught of demonstrators outside, who were busy making do with the next batch of moviegoers waiting for the midnight show.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said Monday he does n't care for the process the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> organization has used to select and announce a Republican vice presidential nominee. He said the choice should have been made and revealed soon after Democrats finished their convention in mid-July, to avoid spotting <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a head start in the fall presidential election campaign. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> also told a news conference for <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> reporters at a French Market restaurant he suspects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` already has made up his mind'' on who his vice presidential running mate will be, but said he has no idea who it is. He said he expects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make his choice public on Wednesday. Asked if the selection process used by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` demeaning,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I do n't care for it, frankly.'' He said he had provided records and answered questions posed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign but has not otherwise campaigned for the vice presidential nomination. `` I did indicate to <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager -RRB- that I'm not certain I like the process,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Monday, heard <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> complaining about the process of selecting the vice presidential nominee, but `` he did n't say anything,'' said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, his press spokeswoman. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Riker </PERSON>, said later that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was `` not critical of the vice president or anyone else in that process ... we're not saying that anyone made a mistake.'' He said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was merely pointing out that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had the option, because of the timing of the conventions, to name his nominee several weeks earlier. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign strategists have held up announcing the veep choice to try to heighten interest in the GOP convention here this week. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said any suspense created by withholding the announcement is of dubious value. `` There may be some suspense around here, but that's not going to decide the election,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech -LRB- Thursday night -RRB- is the big event. That's when 70 percent of the viewers out there will be watching.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he has n't talked with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for about two weeks.

 NEAR THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Hundreds of Contra rebels and civilian supporters are trudging into southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> base camps in a mass exodus, and their leaders say fewer than 2,000 fighters remain in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Rebel officials blame the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the retreat, which began four months ago and leaves the smallest Contra force in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> since the U.S.-backed fighters began their war against the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. More than 1,000 soldiers and civilians returned last week from a central Nicaraguan combat zone. The largest single group to date, about 2,500, was said to be approaching the <LOCATION> Coco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> frontier. Contra officials say the combatants, no longer supplied by air drop inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, had to retreat to receive food and other goods now available through the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, known as AID, in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. They say the new arrivals joined about 8,000 combatants and 5,000 civilians camped out in tents of plastic and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> army ponchos in the rugged terrain. By picking up stakes and guiding their civilian supporters along, the Contras have not only lost any fighting edge but their social base, as well. `` No, they ca n't go back, except with a rifle in their hands,'' said a Contra official whose nom de guerre is Cmdr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Another official, Cmdr. <PERSON> Oswaldo </PERSON>, said the civilians `` beg our troops to take them along ... Without the troops, they are harassed, forcibly recruited.'' Rebel leaders said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is to blame for the retreat and the possible end of the Contras as a fighting force. `` It's important to press the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, for them to understand that four months ago there were no combatants here,'' said Cmdr. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` Now look,'' he said and pointed to scores of tents. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has supplied and trained the rebels since the beginning, stopped a CIA-run military aid program at the end of February. A month later, the Contras and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed a preliminary cease-fire, but peace talks broke off in June. More than $ 17 million in non-lethal assistance handled by AID started arriving in April on condition it be distributed in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and not <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Contra leaders allowed several journalists to visit the camps over the weekend. Their purpose clearly was to show the force together and with high morale, but unable to fight until military aid is restored and supplies air-dropped once again inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. About 170 people who arrived Sunday trudged along a rutted road, sweat soaking their torn clothes. Soldiers carried rusty Soviet-made AK-47 automatic rifles and plastic bags of personal possessions brought on a month-long march. They moved single-file across a field and into a camp, past two armed guards. Some of the civilians sat in the shade of a banana tree and ate raw oatmeal. One was 10 years old, another 15. Ten civilians died of hunger during the march, three drowned and 200 were in need of medical care, said Contras in the group. `` We do n't have enough medicine to treat the people who are coming in and they are n't getting the right food,'' said a Contra doctor known as <LOCATION> Ahuas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tara </LOCATION> _ Tall Pines in an Indian dialect. <PERSON> Ahuas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tara </PERSON>, rebel officials and fighting men said the new assistance program is not working. They said AID provides only rice and black beans, not vegetables and meat, and medicine supplies are mired in bureaucracy. `` Someone from AID will ask me what medicine I urgently need, then he carries the list to the Contra office in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>,'' the doctor said. `` Then they submit the list formally to AID and it takes four to six weeks.'' At a stifling, makeshift clinic, 31 soldiers and civilians lay on cots in a room made for 20. Moral appeared high among the combatants on Sunday. Several played chess on a homemade board, using toothpaste caps as markers. Some played volleyball. There was an odd mix of woman making corn tortillas, some toddlers, veteran combatants and the new recruits. Nearby, a baseball game officially started with rebel commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> tossing the first pitch. <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, who traveled by U.S.-leased helicopter to the camps Sunday, recently was elected to the seven-member Contra political directorate and was said to have resigned his post as the military commander-in-chief. However, he clearly remains in control. Asked what would happen if new military aid is not approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said: `` We will explore some other possibilities, another government or private aid.''

<TEXT>
 Civil rights leaders claimed victory but said they would press a $ 1 million lawsuit against the city even though the police chief rescinded an order to randomly stop black teen-agers in a mixed neighborhood. Police Chief <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> withdrew the order Monday after separate meetings with City Manager <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkey </PERSON>; <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, president of the Toledo chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People; and residents of the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> End </LOCATION> neighborhood. `` The procedure was implemented to address a series of crimes that had been committed,'' <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, the focus of the directive has been perceived as racially motivated instead of the intent of focusing on the suspects involved.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Interdenominational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministerial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and other opponents of the policy said Monday that they considered <PERSON> Felker </PERSON>'s latest action a triumph. `` We put the pressure on the city because it was a patently racist order, an insult to blacks,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the alliance. `` It was another example of the city's insensitivity to the black community. We fought back and will continue to fight.'' <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Thurgood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of black lawyers, said the association was still pursuing the suit filed last week because of the police policy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> on Monday rejected the association's request for a temporary restraining order after talking to <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> and learning he had rescinded his directive. `` I think we won,'' <PERSON> Tolliver </PERSON> said. `` We are satisfied as far as the temporary restraining order is concerned because now it is not necessary. `` The suit will continue, and we expect more plaintiffs to join us.'' Blacks make up about 17 percent of the city's population of 340,000. The association sued Friday on behalf of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a black teen-ager who was followed and then stopped by police in front of his house last week. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, 19, was questioned but not charged with any offense, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit said the policy violated civil rights laws and the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of association and protection against unlawful search and seizure. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s lawyers are seeking $ 1 million in punitive and compensatory damages. On July 8, <PERSON> Felker </PERSON> issued the order for police to stop and question groups of black teen-agers in an attempt to end racial violence in the Old West End. Later last month, the ministerial alliance, which includes ministers from a variety of church congregations in <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to investigate what the ministers called a conspiracy against black officials in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s fourth-largest city Two <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> representatives met once with city officials and once with ministers to try to mediate a solution. No action resulted. The alliance also has been threatening to boycott businesses that do not hire and promote blacks as a way of ending what it calls economic injustice in the city.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Supreme Court Denies Dukakis Claim of Executive
Privilege</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' administration will have to release sensitive internal documents under terms of a state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that rejected his claim of executive privilege. In a unanimous opinion issued Monday, the high court found no basis in the state constitution or laws for the executive branch to withhold memos and other papers. `` I have n't read it yet, but certainly we will comply with the decision in every respect,'' the Democratic presidential candidate said Monday. He promised to release any requested documents `` in accordance with the decision.'' The ruling, prompted by a lawsuit filed by two homosexual men challenging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' foster care policy, could have a far-reaching impact on the operations of government. The high court rejected the principle that the executive branch may keep certain papers secret, a practice that is accepted in about one-quarter of the states and in the federal executive branch. Attorneys for the state had argued that the forced disclosure of internal memos would have a `` chilling effect'' on government policy-making by inhibiting full discussion of options and consequences before policies are adopted and made public. The high court's ruling came in a lawsuit by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Babets </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, two homosexuals challenging the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration's decision to remove two young boys from foster care in their <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> home. The men argued that they needed access to the documents to prove their claim that their rights were violated. `` It's a victory for accountability and open government,'' said attorney <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, who represents Babets and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>. `` The public now has a right to know how its government comes to its decisions. That is a good thing in a democracy.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, chief of staff in the state's office of human resources, said the ruling could distort the decision-making process. `` The chilling effects of the disclosure of these types of documents is real and has the potential to harm the quality of decisions,'' <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said. According to <PERSON> Doniger </PERSON>, the court said the administration could still invoke the exemptions listed in the public records law, which allows the government to withhold documents relating to litigation, medical information about individuals, policies still under discussion and pending real estate deals, among others. Otherwise, the justices said they could find no legal justification for withholding government documents, and they declined to set a precedent by recognizing such a privilege. `` Had the framers of our government's structure intended to recognize in our constitution an executive privilege, it is reasonable to expect that they would expressly have created one,'' Chief Justice <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON> wrote.

<HEAD>Test for Infants Reveals Risk of Low IQ by Age 3, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A test of how long infants look at patterns and faces can help identify children at risk of showing mental disability by age 3, a researcher says. Early identification of high-risk children allows concentration of medical resources on the youngsters who need them, and a way to quickly measure the impact of attempts to help a child's development, said researcher <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> The test should not be used on infants in general, but only those considered at risk, said <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. Such children include those who were treated in neonatal intensive care, who suffered a breathing difficulty called respiratory distress syndrome, or who were born well past their due dates. <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> described research on the test Monday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Other researchers said the test has not yet been rigorously compared to other methods for predicting mental difficulties, and that it is not perfectly accurate. The Fagan Test of Infant Intelligence relies on the fact that most babies look longer at new images than at familiar ones. That shows they can remember and discriminate between the images, reflecting two key abilities important for later life that are tapped by IQ tests, <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said. The test presents infants with pairs of images, either faces or abstract designs. One is familiar, the other new. The time the infant spends looking at each image is precisely measured. Infants who tend to look at each image in a given pair for about the same amount of time are considered at risk for later mental difficulties. <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> cited research in which the test was given to infants 3 months to 7 months old who had been considered at risk. The predictions of the test were compared to the children's IQ levels at age 3. Of the 104 children predicted to be normal, 101 had normal intelligence at age 3. Of the 24 infants predicted to be at risk for mental difficulties, half had low IQ at age 3. <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said most children who take the test because of some risk factor will receive a prediction of normality. So the test is valuable in relieving needless anxieties of parents, he said. The test also will help research into whether exposure to certain substances early in life causes later mental troubles, because it shortens the time between exposure and detection of those troubles, he said. <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> said he receives a royalty on test kits sold by the corporation that markets the test. <PERSON> Claire </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>'s test has not yet been systematically compared for accuracy to other predictive techniques that focus on a child's environment and parents, or development in such areas as language and perception. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McCall </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>'s office of child development, said he and <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON> agree the test should not be used as the sole means of diagnosing a problem. Rather, it should be part of a continuing process of observation by a professional, he said. He also said that because mental disability is so rare even among infants thought to be at risk because of their histories, a flat prediction that they will all turn out fine will be correct 80 percent to 90 percent of the time. <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>'s test allows predicting normal outcome with 97 percent accuracy, however, and `` I think that is useful,'' <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said. But when the test predicts that an infant will turn out to be mentally disabled, it will be wrong at least half the time, he said. That causes needless heartbreak for the parents, he said, and parents without adequate support may give up on the child and adopt lowered expectations. No way to make certain predictions has been found, <PERSON> McCall </PERSON> said, adding he suspects humans change and adapt so much that such predictions may never be possible. <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>'s test can give valuable insights into that developmental process, he said.

 With the national news media focusing on the Republican convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is doing all he can to grab the attention of the local press in his home state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was visiting the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> facility near here today to demonstrate the Democratic ticket's support of the program, which fills underground vaults with crude oil which can be retrieved in a national emergency <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> contends in his campaign that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has no coherent energy policy. While <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> can point to overall prosperity, oil areas such as this have suffered, and the administration has given inconsistent support for the petroleum reserve program. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on Monday was in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> talking about another industry in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that has suffered lately _ the space program. He visited the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and announced that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would favor building a permanent manned space station. `` We will support an all-out effort to restore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership in exploring the universe,'' he said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a long-time supporter of the space station, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the administration has failed to bring the space agency back to top form since the Challenger disaster. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also announced that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were elected, the new president would quickly reinstitute a Cabinet-level council on space with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator at its head. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, another Texan, was put in charge of the space council when he was vice president. The board was later abolished by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has killed efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put it back in operation. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has 29 electoral votes, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is trying to make good on his boast that the Democrats will carry the state this fall. The nine-day campaign trip, almost entirely in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was designed to keep his name in the papers and on local television while Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, another Texan, is receiving all that attention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` We're doing everything we can in these local markets to blow the Republicans off the front page,'' said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> made one of the only two non-Texas stops of his current campaign trip on Monday, scooting over to <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, for a political rally with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> colleagues Sens. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Prior </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the 400 supporters, who endured oven-like conditions in an office building courtyard, that the Republicans in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> were `` out of touch with reality.'' While they were boasting of a booming economy, he said, they were ignoring places like <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> which have lost manufacturing jobs. `` And they're trying to tell you it's never been better,'' he said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are counting on this week's Superdome convention to provide a bounce that will vault the Republicans to victory in the fall That's not impossible _ although it never has worked that way before. The vice president's men are wagering heavily on the pageant of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to help <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> overcome Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who leads <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the early public opinion polls. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> controls the convention show, of course. The delegates are his. The challenge he faces now is to show himself a leader in his own right, after eight years as the understudy. Not since <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> has the candidate who trailed in polls prior to his nominating convention reversed the numbers and won the election. And <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> won his upset, 40 years ago, by overcoming the damage from a bitterly divided Democratic convention. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his convention farewell Monday night with a proud review of an administration record he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shares. Now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moves on stage, to speak for himself. His strategists say that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is the place and Thursday night the time when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will emerge as his own man and as a commanding presence in the race against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. That's high-risk politics, since voters who tune in for the transformation may tune out if they do n't see one. The safe and standard procedure is to play down the event and keep expectations as low as possible. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did that in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, putting out word that his convention address was so dull his wife dozed off while reading it. His speech was a strong one, his delivery smooth and at times even dramatic. His cheerleaders promptly claimed a masterpiece. Hardly. Not a line was memorable enough to have survived this long. But it was a solid performance, impressed a lot of people, and thus a success. Republican tacticians are setting a more difficult target for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not yet been center stage to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, his campaign manager. `` This will be the first time.'' In his convention valedictory, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said his successor must be a man of strength and experience _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It will take someone who has seen this office from the inside, who senses the danger points, will be cool under fire and knows the range of answers when the tough questions come,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` That's the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> I've seen up close _ when the staff and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members have closed the door and when the two of us are alone. `` Someone who's not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to the core of an issue. Someone who never runs away from a fight, never backs away from his beliefs and never makes excuses.'' That's exactly the image <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to display, to quash the `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' taunt of Democrats and the misgivings even of some Republican detractors who still raise the so-called `` wimp factor.'' But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> provided not a single example of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s closed-door performance, and voters may want more than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s word for it. The Republicans say that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' edge in the public opinion polls will erode and finally disappear as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emerges from his supporting role, and as people begin to focus on the issues that divide the candidates. That is supposed to unfold over the four days of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. That assumes a convention imprint more lasting than most. In 1960, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s convention performance become a trademark of his `` new frontier'' campaign. That has n't happened since. So <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has set himself a difficult task. `` I'm not going to try to be a <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' the vice president said. `` There is only one. I want to be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' It is ironic that the man with the run-on resume still is trying to introduce himself. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has, after all, run for president twice and for vice president twice. Listing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s other jobs _ congressman, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, representative to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said `` I think the fellow with that resume has it all.'' But the fellow's own people say that his image remains indistinct. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people really do n't know who <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammerschmidt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, a longtime friend. That normally would n't be regarded as a very friendly thing to say about a veteran politician. In this case, it's part of a risky political game plan.

<TEXT>
 A record 15 million tourists visited <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the first half of the year, providing the nation with $ 1 billion in much-needed foreign currency, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. An administration official said more than 14 million visitors came from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, up 20.1 percent, while other foreign travelers totalled 851,606, an increase of 10 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said today. Tourism earnings were up 26.6 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> figures. The official said 168,000 residents of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> visited the mainland, taking advantage of the <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> government's decision last fall to relax restrictions on mainland travel. Previously, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> prohibited trips to the mainland, although many Taiwanese secretly skirted the ban by entering <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by way of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> or other third countries. Administration official <PERSON> Meng </PERSON> <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> led other foreign countries with 286,431 tourists, followed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with 133,414. In all of 1987, 577,702 tourists came from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and 315,332 from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said. The administration blamed a series of train and airplane disasters in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and an outbreak of epidemics _ <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> was hit by a hepatitis epidemic earlier this year _ for the decline in Americans. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> began promoting tourism as a means to garner foreign exchange when it adopted its economic reform and open door policy 10 years ago. In all of 1978 there were just 1.8 million overseas visitors, including 220,000 outside of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pregnant Woman Killed In Shooting, But Doctors Deliver Baby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRMONT, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A baby girl was delivered alive after her 8 -LCB- - month pregnant mother was shot and killed in front of the police station by her boyfriend, who police said later shot himself to death `` It's just a miracle that the baby is alive. It's just amazing,'' a nursing supervisor said Monday night at <LOCATION> Fairmont </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the baby was delivered by Caesarean section. The baby was in critical condition early today. The 33-year-old mother, <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, was shot five times Monday afternoon by <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> as she sat in her car, police said. The Fairmont woman was shot in front of her teen-age daughter, sister and niece, who were in the back seat, police said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Barrackville </LOCATION>, was believed to be the father of the baby, said Police Lt. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Offutt </PERSON>. Police said they had few details about the problems between <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> stopped in front of the police station as <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was following her car, said Police Chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> parked across the street and walked toward <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s car. He pulled out a gun and shot <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> five times through the window, killing her. Her sister was treated for gunshots wounds and released, officials said. The others in the car were not hurt, police said. `` He just came right up, and within seconds he started shooting,'' <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> said. `` There was not enough time for anyone in the station to react. By the time we got out of the station, he was entering his car and leaving.'' Officers chased him, and spotted him sneaking through a <PERSON> bush </PERSON> and ordered him to drop his gun. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> instead asked the officers to shoot him. `` He said he did n't want to live with it,'' Police Sgt. G.L. <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> said. As the officers pleaded with him to stop, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger, police said. The Fairmont nursing supervisor, who did not give her name, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was dead at the scene of the shooting, but doctors were able to save her baby, who was flown by helicopter to <LOCATION> Ruby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Morgantown </LOCATION> after being delivered at <LOCATION> Fairmont </LOCATION>. The baby was in critical condition, a Ruby Memorial nursing supervisor said. It was not immediately known who would get custody of the girl.

<HEAD>Bentsen's `Other' Opponent Running Hard</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Congressman <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> is busy reminding everyone that he is Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s other opponent this year. That's not so easy, because <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s other-other opponent has n't been named yet. If he's been picked, it's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s secret <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, a two-term representative from <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, opened his challenge to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s re-election long before the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator was picked as a running mate by Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But that selection, <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> says, was good news for him. `` The point is, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> does n't want to be our senator any more. That's my issue now. As best as I can analyze it, he's saying, ` Elect me, so I can resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>','' <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, chosen by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at last month's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, was allowed to remain on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ballot in his bid for a fourth <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term under the so-called `` Lyndon Law'' which was passed to allow then-Sen. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to run for both re-election and the White House in 1960 If he had gotten off the ticket, the seat automatically would have been forfeited to <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> said Texans today believe that law is unfair. `` Nobody is entitled to ask to be elected to two offices on the same ballot. Nobody,'' he said. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>'s challenge of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been uphill all the way, and the Republican congressman acknowledges that. He had to fight through a four-way primary and runoff election just to become the Reublican opponent to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, whose campaign machine often is credited with helping Democrats sweep all statewide offices in the 1982 election. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>'s bid drew a cool reception from many establishment <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> politicians, and he has yet to win a strong endorsement from Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>. An early supporter of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s presidential bid in <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home state, <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> was n't selected as a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> delegate to the Republican National Convention and is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> only as an alternate. `` I've always been a longshot. But I've never thought I was such a longshot that I could n't win,'' said <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, who in 1984 won a stunning upset to oust veteran Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> in the Panhandle-based congressional district. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s finances alone are intimidating. As of June 30, the senator had reported raising about $ 7.5 million for his re-election bid, compared with less than $ 600,000 for <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>. The Republican said he hopes to raise $ 4 million or so by November. In addition, some Republicans quietly had favored <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, generally viewed as a moderate-to-conservative whose chairmanship of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is welcome influence in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> says much of that has changed since <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the Democratic ticket. `` It's made me better known. It has tended to lend credibility to what I've been saying about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s compatability with the <LOCATION> Kennedy-Dukakis </LOCATION> party. It has made some people who were supporting him feel betrayed. Now they're seeing the ` other' <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, and they feel like he's turned his back on what they thought he believed in,'' <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Republicans, including state party Chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, say they think the Dukakis-Bentsen alliance raises legitimate questions about <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s positions on taxes, gun control and other issues important to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> voters. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s got, from my perspective, a good record of fighting gun control. But now, he is running to elect a president who is an avid proponent of gun control. This is a particularly important issue to a lot of people in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> said. `` The notion that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> can change <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> into a gun owner is ridiculous.''

<HEAD>DeSillers Faces Contempt Ruling After Failing To Turn Over
Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> faces a possible contempt citation for failing to turn over a BMW, jewelry and other luxury items she allegedly purchased with money donated for her late son's liver transplants, a trustee says. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON>, who oversees the donated funds, planned to file a motion today in <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> asking that Ms. DeSillers be fined or put behind bars for contempt. Monday's deadline required Ms. DeSillers to surrender the property or post a $ 100,000 bond. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> failed to return to court after appearing earlier in the day in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the bond. Two deadlines for Ms. DeSillers to hand over the items last week had been extended by Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> until Monday. `` The order clearly has been violated,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> said Monday. On Monday, Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> the articles in her apartment were valued at about $ 4,500, and that bonding companies refused to issue a $ 100,000 bond for them. The disputed property, including a 1985 BMW, $ 10,850 in jewelry, nearly $ 6,000 in clothing and $ 4,000 in furniture, were worth more than $ 60,000. Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> also is seeking about $ 130,000 in cash that Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> allegedly paid to herself, relatives and acquaintances. After the deadline expired, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said: `` We are going to weather this one out in Judge <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s courtroom.'' Ms. <PERSON> Gievers </PERSON> believes $ 242,000 remains of the nearly $ 690,000 donated for <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON>' three liver transplants. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> died in April 1987 at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Hospital at age while awaiting his fourth transplant. Ms. <PERSON> DeSillers </PERSON> refuses to pay the hospital about $ 262,000 in medical bills because she says her son received improper care, a charge hospital administrators deny. Contributions, including $ 1,000 from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, had poured in after a small fund collected by <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON>'s school was reported stolen.

<TEXT>
 Three of the men who fought to be where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will stand on Thursday night praised their one-time rival at the opening session of the Republican National Convention. Former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will be followed at the podium by the two other unsuccessful Republican presidential candidates _ television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> tonight and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Both will speak in coveted prime-time slots, as did <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> were afforded morning time at the opening of the convention Monday. The band of former candidates, who in days past spent their time attacking one another and especially <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, have come together in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for the cause of Republican unity. All are keeping busy schedules during convention week, bustling about <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> from receptions to speeches and parties in their honor, along with a hefty schedule of media interviews. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who spoke before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Monday night, told the president: `` This is a powerful legacy that you are handing us here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. I just want you and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> to know that, under the able leadership of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, this party is going to take it and run with it. We're going to win in November.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, along with <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, was doing some running of his own in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. Both are said to be on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s short list of running-mate possibilities. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told a news conference he would be `` a terrific vice president'' but <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> indicated he was wearying of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s long selection process. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, however, appeared to be touting the senator for the running-mate post, saying how proud she was `` that literally a week after <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> withdrew from the presidential race he was out working hard, and I mean hard, for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He does n't look back. And all are doing their dutiful share of Democrat-bashing. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, in his speech to the delegates went a little overboard as far as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp was concerned. He referred to Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as a `` diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' a choice of words the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staff called inappropriate. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> also compared the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a bat `` flying erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its navel in guano.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, who directed some of the most pointed barbs at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the primary said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> represented `` safe and progressive change, safe in that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will build on the solid accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency.'' <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>, who said he will be campaigning virtually full time for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ticket, said the Democrats are looking to the policies of yesterday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the Republicans are `` willing to explore, examine and put new ideas to work,'' he said. In an interview, he admitted to feeling `` a little wistful,'' as he looked forward to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination on Wednesday night. He said he enjoyed the campaign, `` But <PERSON> George </PERSON> was a little stronger this year.'' At a reception Monday, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> thanked his primary supporters. But he added, `` That's behind us and now we're on to the big event where <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will become the 41st president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who raised $ 25 million but failed to attract significant voter support, has set up a large campaign office near the French Quarter. But so far there seems to have been little activity in the office, although he is scheduled to attend a series of rallies and events this week. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> announced last week he would not enter his name into nomination, removing the last wrinkle in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s otherwise smooth convention waters.

<HEAD>Start of Needle-Exchange Program Delayed Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Distribution of free hypodermic needles to drug abusers, aimed at reducing the spread of AIDS, will begin no sooner than October because a clinic has not been able to obtain liability insurance. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, executive director of the Outside In clinic, said Monday that negotiations with the clinic's insurance company, <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, had failed. `` What became clear was that we needed to find another -LRB- insurance -RRB- carrier,'' she said. The program, which officials had said would be the first of its kind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, already had been delayed twice because the clinic was unable to negotiate a policy with <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>. It was originally scheduled to start in July. The distribution program is intended to study whether providing needles can help reduce the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome among intravenous drug abusers. A similar program is scheduled to start in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in a few weeks. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said several other insurance companies have been contacted and the only thing that needed to be negotiated was the price. She declined to name the other companies. Once insurance is obtained, the clinic will need two weeks to get the program started, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. Oct. 1 is probably the earliest the program will begin, she added. Last month a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest medical liability insurer, said the program involved `` areas of unknown liability.'' `` We're especially concerned for the potential of the spread of AIDS from needles supplied by the clinic and later re-used,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> said. The company has provided the clinic's comprehensive medical malpractice and liability insurance for 10 years. The clinic has never filed a claim. The needle program is being financed by a $ 67,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for AIDS Research. Under the yearlong program, 125 drug addicts will exchange used needles for new ones and receive counseling.

<TEXT>
 A funeral procession for a former president who was three times deposed by the army turned quickly into a peaceful protest against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the country's de facto ruler. Without their usual fear of repression by the general's soldiers and police, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s opponents gathered in the plaza in front of the Metropolitan Cathedral on Monday for a requiem Mass for <ORGANIZATION> Arnulfo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON>, who would have been 87 on Monday, died of a heart attack last Wednesday. As the service ended and <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION>'s coffin was placed atop a bright orange firetruck for the trip to the Garden of Peace cemetery, a great, seemingly spontaneous cry went up from the throng in the plaza. `` Justice,'' they shouted. The crowd followed the cortege out of the plaza, through the narrow, brick streets of the old section of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and onto the capital's main business artery. With each block, the procession grew until it filled the four-lane street for nearly a mile. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go,'' the marchers shouted. `` Arnulfo president, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> delinquent.'' The Panamanian government is dominated by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who commands the country's 15,000-member Defense Forces. He was indicted by two federal grand juries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February on charges of narcotics trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s soldiers and police, who have crushed dozens of protests in the past 14 months, did not interfere with the funeral. Many in the procession waved white banners or the flags of political parties opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Thousands of people lined the streets, often impeding progress. It took the procession nearly six hours to wend its way the three miles to the cemetery. It arrived at sundown, more than two hours behind schedule. Prominent in the procession were members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crusade </ORGANIZATION>, which led dozens of demonstrations against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in 1987 and early this year but has n't been on the streets since the government smashed a protest march last spring and arrested most of its leaders. `` They could n't very well halt a funeral procession for <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> and, with the cap off, the people have again come out to show how they feel about the government,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON>, one of the few original Crusade leaders who has not been forced into exile. The Authentic Panamanian Party, which <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> founded in 1935, refused a government offer to provide military honors at the funeral. Instead, it decided on the requiem Mass conducted on the cathedral steps by Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, the country's Roman Catholic leader. `` We ca n't accept that those who always overthrew the doctor -LRB- <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> -RRB- share in our grief,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Artola </PERSON>, party vice president. `` The ceremony is going to be for the people.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and his daughter, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, were among the mourners. In death, <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> won praise even from government-controlled newspapers. They referred in vague terms to his `` errors'' during 57 years in politics, but praised his nationalism and defiance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Elected to three four-year terms, the military allowed him to serve a total of only 2 -LCB- years. In January 1941, during the first term, he turned down a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> War </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request for land for military bases along the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. At the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' urging, the military ousted him in a coup later that year, 9 -LCB- months after he took office. Soon after, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had its 37,000 acres for the bases. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> was elected again in 1949 but tossed out by the army in 1951. His third term began on Oct. 1, 1968, but lasted only 11 days, until his overthrow in a coup led by Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> replaced as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. Just four years ago, <ORGANIZATION> Arias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> entered the presidential race again. The government said <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardito </PERSON> <PERSON> Barletta </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s candidate, won by 1,713 votes, but the election was widely seen as fraudulent <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> spent long periods in self-imposed exile. He had gone to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for medical treatment in April and remained there until his death.

 Political differences were put aside Monday as <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congresswoman <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> welcomed Republicans into her home on <LOCATION> Bourbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the favored path of partying conventioneers. The blowout at Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>' 193-year-old house honored <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators and representatives. A party Tuesday night will honor Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. Other celebrations Monday included evening cruises on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the start of a three-night engagement by jazz trumpeter <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON>. In between were free brunches, buffets and open bars at all hours for delegates and hangers-on. Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said her party was to repay a 12-year-old debt of gratitude. In 1976, she helped plan the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Her hosts included Republicans, and their city was in deep financial trouble. `` Once we were established in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, everyone, regardless of partisan politics, worked very hard to make it very successful. The same thing, I think, is true here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON> said. `` It's a tiny bit of reciprocity on my part. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> has been in a very serious economic downturn. This is a real lift in spirits and the economy as well. When your city needs help, everyone pulls together.'' `` <PERSON> Lindy </PERSON> told me, ` No problem, I have house parties all the time,''' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> as he worked his way around a police barricade near the gray double doors of the old house. `` The Democrats are paying their respects to the Republicans,'' said <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>. `` This is like <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> _ a lot of intermingling between Republicans and Democrats,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, a conventioneer from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. `` I think the party is wonderful,'' said former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Curb </PERSON>. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans 189,741 to 34,853 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON> is a vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. About 15 percent of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s registered voters are Republicans, but the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> has won five of the state's last eight presidential races. All of which prompts this reassurance from Mrs. <PERSON> Boggs </PERSON>: `` They're not overrunning my house They're most cordially invited.'' Another elegant party was sponsored by the Eagle Forum, a conservative organization headed by <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON>, which paid $ 5,000 to rent the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> for a late-afternoon salute to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> celebrities. Mrs. <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON>, asked whether her family-oriented group found anything wholesome to do in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said, `` Well, the food is wholesome.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON>, a 76-year-old alternate from <LOCATION> Farmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, who was at the museum, said he had no plans to visit `` wicked'' Bourbon Street. `` I hear all about it, and people say we should see it. But I've got other things to do.'' The celebrities were Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, former Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and former Secretary of Education <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. Each was given a clock by Mrs. <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON>. The clocks have four faces, which she said would keep the honorees on time across the country as they campaign for the Republican ticket this fall. The Eagle Forum had scarcely vacated the museum when bars and buffets were re-stocked for a late-evening costume bash for $ 1,000 contributors to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Fearful that delegates would tire of spicy Cajun and Creole snacks, caterer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> served stir-fried chicken and peanuts, pasta topped with spicy cured ham, crawfish-tail fritters and fried pork rinds, the last recently revealed as a favorite snack of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> basked in the praise of Republicans at their national convention, including the man who has led the party for the past eight years and has been her own leading man for 36 years. The first lady in turn thanked the conventioneers who paid her tribute, saying they had given her the most fulfilling years she has known. `` You've given us such a wonderful life, a life I never dreamed possible,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the convention. `` It's the most extraordinary feeling to represent a nation and its people I can never thank you enough.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, introduced by actor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, appeared before the convention Monday night in the same melon-colored dress she wore the night her husband won the 1980 Republican nomination. `` I do hang on,'' she laughed in noting her recycled outfit. In a video presentation of their White House years shown to the convention, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of his wife, `` I ca n't imagine life without her.'' `` I've been proud of her for a long time, but never more so than in these last eight years,'' he then told the convention before making his prepared speech to the delegates. For her part, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> alluded to the accolades she has received for her anti-drug work and gave credit to the party members. `` You really gave me the chance to be more than I thought I could be,'' she said. A poignant display from the president came earlier in the day when he showed up as a surprise guest at a Republican party luncheon tribute to the first lady. `` The presidency would n't have been the joy it's been for me without her there beside me,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told some 3,000 guests as his wife of 36 years stood beside him. `` That second-floor living quarters in the White House would have seemed a big and lonely spot without her waiting for me every day.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was visibly moved by her husband's simple but deeply personal tribute. The couple embraced as the room erupted in applause. The scene reinforced the public image of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> as a close and deeply committed couple. They met when both were actors in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and married in 1952. `` What do you say about someone who gives your life meaning ... someone who is always there to support and understand you, someone who makes sacrifices so that your life will be easier and more successful?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` What you say is that you love that person and treasure her.'' He also said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had looked after him `` through recuperations and crises. Every president should be so lucky.'' `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, in front of all your friends here today, let me say, ` Thank you for all you do, thank you for your love and thank you for just being you,''' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Also paying tribute to Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the luncheon emceed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> co-chairman, were several party officials and singer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> and comedian <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>. In brief remarks, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is to receive the party's presidential nomination Wednesday night, and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. `` Today the curtain begins to close on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era of the Republican party. We've had a wonderful run. But the time has come for the Bushes to step into the leading roles and for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to step into the wings,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 The three major television networks grumbled after the Democratic convention and cut the staff brought here, but they nevertheless are reserving prime time all week for the Republicans _ and praying for news. The biggest sure-fire story was President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell speech to the party he led for eight years. But that was Monday, and the rest of the week loomed with two hours to fill each night. Sometimes more. The networks are making a good-faith effort to appear gung-ho, with much talk of democracy and responsibility and how things are n't really so boring. There is, after all, The Unanswered Question of whom <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will select as his running mate. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> anchor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> labels the suspense ersatz, but the question remains. And then there are the questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself. How will he acquit himself? Will he emerge from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s shadow? Will the convention give him the boost he needs? `` There's lots of news going on here,'' said <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Venardos </PERSON>, executive producer for CBS News special events. `` Just because something is n't big news does n't mean it is n't news.'' CBS is leading the campaign for prime-time convention coverage, boring or not, with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> not far behind. `` Some things in television are more important than ratings, even more important than money. Coverage of the political conventions is one of them,'' CBS anchor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> said in a `` My Turn'' article published this week in Newsweek. Rather derided a suggestion by `` one television executive,'' after the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention with its disastrous ratings, that the parties and maybe the networks should `` come up with something more appealing to the American people.'' No way, wrote Rather. `` Not everything about democracy is exciting. Some things are simply important. That is reason enough to cover them.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said the comment, by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> News President <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON>, was taken out of context. `` <PERSON> Roone </PERSON> was exhibiting a certain frustration which all of us feel that more Americans do not participate in the process,'' he said. <PERSON> Arledge </PERSON> went further than any other network executive in openly speculating that <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> might cut its coverage in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The prospect so worried the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> that `` we were very adamant'' with the network, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, hired by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to produce the convention. `` We felt it was unfair to change the rules in the middle of the game. We told them it could hurt them if they did it.'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said he was unaware of any pressure on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and added: `` I ca n't imagine the party would act in such bad taste.'' He also said there was `` never any doubt in my mind or in any correspondent's mind that we were going to cover this exactly as we covered the convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' With their high-profile anchors and correspondents, their trailer encampments the size of small towns, their glass skyboxes visible in the convention hall, the networks remain a dominating presence even in their lean new incarnation. `` You can not put in all this effort, all these people, all this money, and say you're going through the motions,'' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, senior producer of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said much of what goes on at the conventions is `` not of national interest.'' But he added, `` It's two weeks every four years when people stop to consider how the country should be run. Who will be the next president? There's no bigger story than that.''

<HEAD>Yonkers City Council Again Rejects Housing Desegragaton Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> early today rejected a federal court-ordered housing desegregation plan, despite the imposition of potentially bankrupting fines issued after it voted the same way two weeks ago. Opponents of the plan far outnumbered supporters at the meeting, which began Monday night and ran past midnight to allow all 80 people who signed up to speak five minutes each. On Wednesday, the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> will hear arguments on contempt against the city issued two weeks ago by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON>. On Aug. 1, the Council voted 4-3 to reject the affordable housing plan that would integrate the state's fourth-largest city. The plan was in accordance with a federal court order, which calls for 200 units of low-income housing and 800 units of moderate-income housing. Sand subsequently held the city and the four council members who voted against the plan in contempt. He also issued heavy fines against the city. The fines had accumulated to $ 25,600 when the federal appeals court ordered them temporarily halted last week. The court also ordered the council to meet once a week to cast another vote on the housing plan. Monday's meeting was the first. Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON>, who supports the desegregation plan, expressed disappointment over today's 4-3 vote. `` I think the councilmen have had an opportunity to make their political statements,'' he said. `` They have had their publicity, their national exposure. This would have been an opportune time for them to come out as far ahead as they can publicity-wise ... and not do any real harm to the city.'' Much of the crowd filed out as the mayor spoke. Some sang `` good night, mayor'' to tune of `` Good Night, Ladies.'' But Councilman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON>, one of the four opponents, got a standing ovation when he called the plan `` a plain disaster for the city of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>.'' It's `` a planning disaster and no one should force it on the taxpayers of this city,'' he said. Earlier Monday, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> proposed an alternative to the plan that has divided this racially mixed city and threatened to send it into bankruptcy. The proposal would provide 100 new units of low-income rental housing and allow another 100 low-income families to buy their own cooperative apartments. <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON> unveiled his plan at a meeting of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> civic leaders. He also proposed an alternative to the 800 units of moderate income housing that Sand ordered built during the next four years. Under <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON>'s plan, 750 units would be built over a 10-year period. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, president of the Black Women's Political Caucus in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, attended Monday's meeting but took no position on <PERSON> DeLuca </PERSON>'s plan.

 Here is a transcript of the tribute to former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> delivered by Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> at the Republican National Convention. Thank you very, very much. Thank you <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, thank you ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, let me take you back for a minute to the year 1952. Remember, at that time the Democrats had been in charge of everything around here for over 30 years. And what the liberal wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> believed in had become the conventional wisdom and dominated the councils of government. And you remember, some of us remember that what they believed in, of course, was government _ big government and more big government. In some parts of the country, in 1952, there were people who had grown to adulthood without ever having known a Republican who had been elected to a high public office. And unfortunately, in some places the Republicans they did know were always apologizing for their views. And then, from out of the West, a pioneer appeared and he did n't apologize He had a message. He talked about individualism and self-reliance and personal responsibility. At first, his was a very lonely voice. And they had a name for him; they called him a conservative. What's more, he proudly admitted he was a conservative, because he wanted to serve the principles upon which this nation was founded. Because to this day, these are the principles that have meant freedom, and equality, and liberty for the people of this country. The year was 1952 and that pioneer was <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>. And his ideas seemed pretty radical at the time. He just did n't believe that all the power came from government He dared to believe in the people. He dared to believe that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people were smart enough and capable enough to shape their own future. Well, this conservative idea picked up steam. And slowly, gradually, it caught on. Gradually, even political leaders began to realize that the real, deep down, fundamental beliefs of mainstream <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are the same beliefs that this pioneer brought with him in 1952 when he first won election as senator from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. -LRB- Film clip of <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>'s life is shown -RRB-. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> has served our party. -LRB- Applause -RRB-. Ladies and gentlemen, if I may have your attention. Let me have the last word about <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, you've served our party and this nation, and when we've needed you you've always come through Next January, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to be sworn in as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And when it happens, it will be in large part because of the pioneering leadership and party-building of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> _ a man of honor, a man of integrity, a fighter, an idealist, a patriot, Mr. Conservative. And <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, for a lot of us, thousands of us here in this room and millions more around the country who've been inspired by your leadership over the years, you will always be Mr. Republican.

 Here is a transcript of the speech by former Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> to the Republican National Convention on Monday. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Judge <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrera </PERSON>, fellow Republicans, and fellow Americans. Over the next four days, we Republicans will be talking to our fellow citizens about the issues we care about: About our work, our families and homes, our schools, our worries about crime and drugs, our desire to extend and expand the peace we have achieved. Today, we Republicans are the party of the issues, the party willing to explore, and examine and put new ideas to work. We are the party that has brought <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> back to economic strength, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a man with unequalled experience in government, is the man who will put its newest ideas to work. Last month, the Democrats held their convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The most interesting thoughts of that gathering came not from its presidential candidate, who really represents the failed liberal policies of the past. No, the most interesting thoughts came from the Reverend <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. I would like to read to you a message I've sent today to Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. Perhaps it came from all of us. Dear Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: The du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> family was deeply moved by the words of the <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> family at your convention. The eloquence of your children's affection was matched by the eloquence of your grandmother's quilt Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, you understand the struggle and pain of poverty. And the fact that it is less rampant than you portray does not make it less important than you suggest. When you reach out to the poor, your hands and your heart touch us all. You say you come from the poor, from the projects, from a teen-aged mother and a broken home. But, Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, you also come from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has offered you her hand, and you have helped move <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. You are a leader in our nation. As long as your lungs have breath yours will be a prominent voice. But as long as you speak as a Democrat, you will never be a successful leader. For the party you have joined, <PERSON> Reverend </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and the philosophy you have adopted can not help the people for whom you speak.

 I can not speak as eloquently as you, so let me just speak plainly: Your party has lost its way. Our party has found its way. Your party talks about a peaceful world and that is right. Our party opened the door to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, built the bridge to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and is paving the road to peace. Your party fights for freedom in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and that is right. But our party fights for freedom wherever it is in peril and wherever it is sought. Your party walks on the picket lines and that is symbolic, but our party creates the jobs _ millions and millions and millions of them. Your party sleeps with the homeless and that is noble. But our party lowers interest rates and that lowers rents. Your party recognizes the invaluable role that teachers play in the lives of our children and you are right. But only our party protects the indispensable role of parents in the lives of our children. Your party raises the voices of our senior citizens and that is right. But our party lowers inflation and cuts their cost of living. Your party's candidate believes he made a miracle happen in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Well, he is right. But you know and I know that that miracle is named President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Your party bemoans a myth _ the absence of good times with good jobs and good wages. Our party celebrates a fact _ the creation of good times with good jobs at good wages. Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, you and I and everyone all across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> know that the challenge is not ended. There is work to be done. Not everyone is reaping the rewards of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s prosperity. You dramatize that better than almost anyone, except those who are suffering.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> struggled long to achieve equality of rights. We must now guarantee not only equality of opportunity, but a continued abundance of opportunity. Your party does not know how to do that. And our party does. Reverend <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, you seek common ground, you seek higher ground. Well, may I suggest, in all sincerity, that the ground you seek is here, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, is the party of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. We ask you to join us because we need you, and you need us. You can help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> understand the need. And we Republicans have shown <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> how to meet the need. Together, we can not only keep hope alive, we can make dreams come true. Signed, Sincerely, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>. Now, let me add, my friends, that dreams become reality when experienced leaders grasp the challenges before us. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' record shows that the high taxes and free spending policies of yesterday guide him. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as a congressman, a diplomat, intelligence chief and vice president, has shown that, as president, he will not only keep hope alive, but help make the dreams of millions of Americans come true. Thank you and God bless.

 Here is the transcript of the speech by former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> to the Republican National Convention on Monday. Mr. Chairman, fellow Republicans, ladies and gentlemen: I am honored to address the opening session of our party's convention For me, this occasion is also a reunion with my former colleagues from the Republican primary debates. We had our differences then, but we are all agreed on one thing now: We are dedicated to making <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. I am confident that in November the people will choose <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because he represents safe and progressive change for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, safe in that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will build on the solid accomplishments of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency. Americans know <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will trash them. Thanks to the Reagan-Bush achievements of the past eight years, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s international standing has been literally transformed. When I last spoke to a Republican convention in 1980, we saw a nation thrown off balance by blunder and gloom. The Soviets were on the march everywhere. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> had been seized. Soviet surrogates were triumphant in <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. A cruel war raged in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, our allies were disheartened and freedom was in retreat. And all the Democrats could offer was indecision and malaise. Today, eight years later, the policy of peace through strength has begun to pay off. The Russians are leaving <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Their surrogates in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> are in trouble. The <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> conflict is drawing to a conclusion. The Soviets are negotiating our arms control agenda of reduction and cuts, designed not to increase Soviet superiority. Democracy, not communism, is on the march. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> helped make this happen and he is indeed the safe candidate for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But he also knows what changes are needed to strengthen the most successful administration in recent history. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team has made progressive change central to our party platform at this convention. In contrast, hard evidence confirms that Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not the candidate of safe progressive change, but the candidate of radical and dangerous change. He does not believe in peace through strength. As chief executive of the state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> he has steadfastly refused to permit the critical warning and communication facility _ the <ORGANIZATION> Ground </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GWEN </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ to be built in his state, leaving a serious gap in our nation's defense. He will turn over our global peace-keeping obligations exclusively to international organizations _ the <ORGANIZATION> UN </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION>. In the Third World, he will resurrect the sterile policies of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will weaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by withdrawing support for the MX and the Migitman missiles and reduce SDI to a constrained research and development program. Until recently he has even opposed the B1 and Stealth bombers. Of course the Democrats know that people would reject the real <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. So, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said, he is traveling incognito. You have to admit <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was good theater. It was an off-Broadway revival of `` The Odd Couple,'' starring the diminutive clerk from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the tall stranger from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. But when you look at the real Dukakis-Bentsen foreign policies you have to ask yourself, `` are they running against us or are they running against each other?'' And then there's the Reverend <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who likes to say `` a bird likes to fly on two wings.'' Maybe he forgot some birds with two wings ca n't fly at all _ like the extinct dodo bird that was too stupid to defend itself, or the ostrich which prefers to live with danger by ignoring it. In fact, the more you look at it, the less the Democratic ticket looks like a bird at all. It's more like a bat _ blind as a bat, endowed with the sophisticated sensing mechanisms we saw in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> but totally unable to differentiate. Flying erratically for brief periods at low levels and hanging upside down for extended periods in dark, damp caves up to its naval in Guano. Lord, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> does n't need any more of that. And so, my friends, you and I know that next November's election may be the most important since World War II. Our efforts this week may be decisive in its outcome. We are in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>: _ To unify our party _ To endorse our worthy candidate, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ To dedicate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to safe and progressive change _ To dedicate ourselves, and in behalf of mankind, to a world guided by rule of law and peace through strength. I thank you.

 Here is a transcript of the speech by Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to the Republican National Convention on Monday night. Thank you very much. I want to tell you. Thank you, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. I want to tell you my favorite <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> story. But first of all, I want to thank <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, not only for her very gracious introduction but for the great service she has rendered <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by serving in <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet. Thank you, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>. It'll probably come as no surprise to you that my favorite <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> movie is `` <ORGANIZATION> Knute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockne </ORGANIZATION>, All-American'' _ starring <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Knute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockne </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipp </PERSON>. We all remember the famous line about `` winning one for the Gipper.'' But I'll always remember that movie for another scene. At practice one day, coach <ORGANIZATION> Knute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockne </ORGANIZATION> turns to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipp </PERSON>, a freshman running back at <LOCATION> Notre </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dame </LOCATION>, and tells him to go in and scrimmage against the varsity. And <PERSON> Rockne </PERSON> says to the Gipper, `` They'll give you the ball. You just run with it.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> looks at coach <PERSON> Rockne </PERSON> and says, `` How far, coach?'' Well, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> gave you the ball eight years ago, no one could have imagined how far you would carry it. And today, thanks to you Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, our nation is in the midst of the most powerful renewal and expansion in our history; an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> poised, better than any nation on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, for the exploding potential of the last decade of this century, and the boundless horizons of the next. Now, we all know the dreary litany of domestic troubles that you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faced in 1980: double-digit inflation; rising unemployment; a 21 percent prime rate, and a mortgage rate of 16 percent; a falling living standard, and the very real fear that the world was somehow running out of energy. Worst of all, there was a sense of despair, and defeat, something the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have never felt before _ and they did n't like it. When you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office in 1981, we had to free this nation from the stifling hand of excessive government, the crushing tax burden on families and on business, the smothering regulations _ all of which had sent <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> into the worst competitive decline of our history. Contrary to all the doomsayers, we have witnessed an entrepreneurial renaissance. It's electrified the world. It's raised our standard of living We've created more than 5 million new small businesses, and 17 million new jobs _ and as <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, they are good jobs, good for all the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. In the last five years, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has led the world in industrial output and the creation of new manufacturing jobs in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Today, even the rest of the world is investing in our country. They're building factories in our nation. They're creating jobs for Americans _ and, ladies and gentlemen, we're now increasing our exports to the world at the astonishing rate of 30 percent a year. And what's so great, we've created a `` working model'' of freedom and prosperity, a model that will not only carry the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> into the 21st century, but it will help carry other countries as well.

 <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, gave this nation a new birth of freedom. Well, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, you've helped give the whole world a new birth of freedom. Nations around the world are following our example, choosing low tax rates, less government, and more freedom. They're learning what our people knew right from the beginning _ that freedom works. And, ladies and gentlemen, freedom will work wherever it's tried on this Earth. That is our model for the world. Our opponents tell us and tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that <ORGANIZATION> Reaganomics </ORGANIZATION> has failed; that, because of problems we have yet to solve, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has failed. But if that's the case, why are so many nations in the world following our example? Why are delegations pouring in from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ to study the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> miracle that has created more new jobs, and more new businesses, than all of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> combined _ without inflation, and that is a miracle. Today, with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> leading the way, democracy and freedom are on the march around the world. The world's political climate is changing, and even its most dangerous political dinosaurs _ socialism and Marxism _ are threatened with extinction. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are trying to reform their societies and their economies, not out of some ideological awakening, but because they have to. Ladies and gentlemen, what a sight it was, what it was, an opportunity to watch <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> president _ standing at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, under the very nose of <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilyich </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, standing there and proclaiming faith, democracy, freedom, human rights for Soviet Jews and Christians. And making us proud of the American ideal. He said, throughout the world, free markets are the model for economic growth. That democracy is the standard by which all governments are measured. And those <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> students knew that, finally, they were hearing the truth. Well, ladies and gentlemen, our party, like our nation, has only one reason for existence. Both were born out of a dedication to a very simple yet profound proposition: that all human beings are equal in the eyes of our creator _ and therefore all people are equally endowed with inalienable human rights. And the secret of the American miracle is that we put our faith in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people _ in their talent, their creativity, and in their God-given potential. And that has been the secret of the American miracle. We rediscovered under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that our people are our greatest resource. And as the party of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> _ and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ we believe that freedom and hope and opportunity ca n't be for just some of us. They've got to be for all of us. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must keep moving ahead. We ca n't leave anyone behind. Democrats measure compassion by how many people are receiving government assistance _ we measure compassion by how few need it. Democrats see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> locked in a class struggle between owners and workers, between the rich and the poor _ we want an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where workers can become owners and poor can become rich.

 Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talks about plant closings _ we want to continue plant openings. And Democrats see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in terms of its limits _ we see <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in terms of its boundless possibilities. Ladies and gentlemen, if we do our job right, I predict that by 1992 _ at the re-election of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as our president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ I want to predict here tonight that one-quarter of our party will be black, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans, who see in our party the best chance they've ever had for their themselves and their families. What's the real purpose of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution? It was n't to defeat Democrats. It was to provide superior leadership, to provide new ideas, and to restore confidence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Like the American Revolution itself, the greatness of our revolution is not to be measured by who we're against, but by what we are for. Last month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, last month in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed to say what they're for. All they said is who they're against. They all said, `` We ca n't stand another eight years of Republican policies.'' Well, of course they ca n't. Another eight years of Republican policies, it'll be clear to <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, that with 17 million new jobs, and 5 -LCB- million new small businesses, at that rate, ladies and gentlemen, all their constituents will be Republicans. Well, this is no time to stop. No time to go back. Got a lot of work to do. We do n't want low inflation _ we want no inflation. We do n't want low unemployment _ we want no unemployment. We need a safety net to keep people from falling _ but we need a ladder of opportunity upon which all people can climb. Ladies and gentlemen, we do n't just want to oppose communism _ we want to support those men and women who are fighting for freedom and democracy, whether they're in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We want to free people. We want to free people not only from too much dependence on government _ we want to free them from dependence on drugs, from disrespect for human life. Mr. President, you've brought us to the threshold of a new era. In fact, you've brought us over the threshold. You've shown us, Mr. President, that we can do more than contain our adversaries _ we can transcend them. You've shown us, Mr. President, how we can even make the threat of nuclear war obsolete, through the now-proven technology of strategic defense for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And you've reminded us that the very first and best <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> is a strong American family. Mr. President, most of all, above everything else, you've shown us that the power of a right idea is the single greatest force on this Earth. It's a powerful legacy that you leave us, it's a powerful legacy that you're handing us here tonight in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. And we just want you and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> to know that, under the able leadership of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, this <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is going to take it and run with it and we're going to win in November. We're going to finish the job. We're going to finish what we began in 1980: To help all Americans _ to help in the spirit of <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, we want to help all people everywhere _ to share in the success of freedom, and democracy, and peace. That is our legacy and that is our future. God bless you, Mr. President. May God bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Thank you very, very much.

 Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Thank you, thank you very much. Thank you. Eight years ago I stood here with my family _ in this same dress, as a matter of fact. I do hang on _ when my husband was nominated for the first time. And four years ago, I stood up here and thanked you for all that you'd done for me, not knowing that I was going to have a chance to do it again. But you've given us such a wonderful life, a life that I really never dreamed possible and it's the most extraordinary feeling to represent a nation and its people. And I can never thank you enough for all the experiences and memories that you've made possible. The last eight years have been the most fulfilling ones of my life. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> mentioned the drug letters that I have received, and the program has meant so much to me. But you really gave me that chance, and you really gave me the chance to be more than I thought I could be, and brought something out in me that I did n't know was there. And you helped me and I thank you a great deal for that. And you've always been there for us. It's true there were some rough times for my husband and me, but as I said to you four years ago, I always felt that I could draw on you for your support and your affection. And I did draw on you a great deal more than you knew, and I thank you for that too. Now, I'm sure that this will be the last time that I'll speak before a Republican convention. My husband's and my time on the center stage of Republican politics is passing, one era's ending, another is beginning. But before I go, I want to thank you for all the years that you've worked for us, and on our behalf. So many years really. I'll miss you, I'll never forget you So, good night and God bless.

 Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by former Secretary of Transportation <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> at the Republican National Convention on Monday. Thank you. Thank you very much. <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>. You're an outstanding member of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, and I know that you're going to have a resounding re-election victory in November. Thank you so much. Peace, progress, opportunity. That's what we're here to celebrate. That's the legacy of a great president, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. And that will be the living legacy of the next president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. First, let me thank the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders for televising their Convention. What I saw and heard reminded me and millions of other former Democrats why we're proud to be Republicans. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> convention speech was just like the Democrat platform, hedging on defense, hedging on taxes, hedging on spending. We're not running against <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, we're running against <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> `` Governor <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>,'' `` Governor <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>,'' `` Governor <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>'' tried mightily to paint over his liberal policies with pretty rhetoric. But the make-up job failed. As an old federal trade commissioner, I want to know -- whatever happened to truth in advertising? But we've come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> not to pin the tail on the donkey. We're here to pin our hopes on the American future. And we're not buying the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deception. Despite what he says, this election is about ideas and ideology. They do matter. They will matter to Americans who face a choice this year as stark and dramatic as any in memory. We Americans faced a similar choice in 1980. And what did we get for our choice? We got a president who does n't apologize for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests _ he asserts them. We got a breakthrough in Soviet relations and the INF treaty. We got the longest economic boom in peacetime history. It was my privilege for seven years to serve the man who made this happen _ one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatest presidents, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, for that opportunity. Today's strong economy means stronger families. And we affirm the woman who chooses to work in the home. But our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions of women, and let me say to the women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: I respect the fact that some of you have questions. I also ask you to have an open mind. You know better then anyone that a job _ a good job _ is absolutely basic to a family's happiness and stability. That's our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? -LRB- Crowd yells, `` No.'' -RRB- In the past eight years, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has created an incredible jobs machine _ more jobs for more Americans than ever before. And two-thirds of the 17 million new jobs created since 1982 went to women. Good jobs, not bad jobs. Real work, not make work. That's our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? -LRB- Crowd yells, `` No.'' -RRB- You did it. You were the expansion. You, the women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ who are holding jobs as never before, who've started businesses as never before, who have invested as never before. This expansion _ it's your triumph. But it was <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who set in motion the forces which allowed that growth to occur and the economy to bloom. That's our freedom. Are we going to let them take it away? -LRB- Crowd yells, `` No.'' -RRB- <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is on a roll. If this great economic upsurge is stopped, if we have a President who raises taxes again and in creases regulation again and stifles growth again _ and believe me, that's what <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will do _ if we let the liberals back in, we lose all that progress _ your progress

 We women would be especially vulnerable. We're always vulnerable when jobs are cut back and the economy stagnates. Remember the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> years, when workers were afraid to open pay envelopes because there just might be a pink slip inside, when families gave up hope of ever owning their own home, when parents feared their childrens' generation would be worse off than their own. That was real economic violence. We have been there before, and we must never go back again. So I ask you, women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, not just to support us. Work with us, to ensure that this growth continues. Work with us, so that each American has a chance and a choice. Work with us to change what needs to be changed. The future belongs to our children, and child care is one of those changes. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to march our kids lock step to a government institution where <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will set all the rules. Only one kind of child care deserves federal aid, he says. But governor, people work part-time, full-time, night shifts, day shifts, swing shifts. One size does not fit all. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a father of five, a grandfather of 10, will give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> parents what they want _ child care supervised by people who share their values: in a community-based setting, a relative's or neighbor's home, a church-sponsored center, or by the mother or father who works full-time at home <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes the parents should choose. But taking care of children also means making bad schools good and good schools better. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, too, who has worked tirelessly to end illiteracy, understand what we have to do. We must rescue a generation of children from the social experiments and educational fads that gave us erratic school policies, declining skills and low SAT scores. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have reordered our educational priorities. Commitment to excellence will continue to be our watchword. But education is more than molding the intellect _ it means shaping the character as well. It is character that will enable our children to say `` yes'' to the intellectual challenges of a new century and `` no'' to the physical and moral dangers of drugs. The war on drugs must be fought by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrolling our waters, and police officers in the alleys of our cities. These brave men and women can win battles, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows that ultimately the war can only be won when the fathers, the mothers, the sons and the daughters of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unite to speak with one voice to just say no. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saw this solution when most politicians did n't even see the problem. What a great first lady she has been. Next spring marks the 200th anniversary of the first inauguration of a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> President. There have been many changes in our nation since that day when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> took the oath of office. Yet the values on which this great nation was founded are just as vital today as they were 200 years ago. We would do well to remember the parting words of that first president who said: `` Of all the dispositions ... which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and cherish them.'' What wise words from our first president. It is reassuring in this day, when we find faith and morality under attack, to know that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a man who truly respects and cherishes these guiding principles. As we go forward to elect a new President, let us then select a man who will keep faith with the timeless values on which this great nation was founded, even as he leads our nation into a greater future. Tonight, I am proud to be an American. Tonight, I am proud to be a Republican. And tonight, I am proud that a great man, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, will be our candidate for the next President of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Thank you. God bless you all.

<TEXT>
 Here is a transcript of the speech by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the Republican National Convention on Monday night. Thank you. Thank you, thank you all. Madam chairman, delegates to this convention and fellow citizens, thank you for that warm and generous welcome. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I have been enjoying the finest of Southern hospitality since we arrived here yesterday. And believe me, after that reception, I do n't think the Big Easy has ever been bigger than it is tonight. And with all due respect to Cajun cuisine, cooking, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> jazz, nothing could be hotter than the spirit of the delegates in this hall, except maybe a victory celebration on Nov. 8. In that spirit, I think we could be forgiven if we give ourselves a little pat on the back for having made <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> a proud word once again. And, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a proud nation again. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I are so honored to be your guest tonight _ to share a little of your special time. And we thank you. Now I want to invoke executive privilege to talk for a moment about a very special lady who has been selfless, not just for our party but for the entire nation. She is a strong, courageous and compassionate woman, and wherever she's gone, here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as well as abroad, whether with young or old, or comforting the grieving or supporting the youngsters who are fighting the scourge of drugs, she makes us proud. I've been proud of her for a long time, but never more so than in these last eight years. With your tribute to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> today, you warmed my heart as well as hers _ and believe me, she deserved your tribute. I am deeply grateful to you for what you have done. When people tell me that I became president on Jan. 20, 1981, I feel I have to correct them. You do n't become president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. You are given temporary custody of an institution called the presidency, which belongs to our people. Having temporary custody of this office has been for me a sacred trust and an honor beyond words or measure. That trust began with many of you in this room many conventions ago. Many's the time that I've said a prayer of thanks to all Americans who placed this trust in my hands, and tonight, please accept again our heartfelt gratitude, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s and mine, for this special time that you've given in our lives. Just a moment ago, you multiplied the honor with a moving tribute. And being only human, there's a part of me that would like to take credit for what we have achieved. But tonight, before we do anything else, let us remember, that tribute really belongs to 245 million citizens who make up the greatest _ and the first _ three words in the Constitution: We the people. It is the American people who endured the great challenge of lifting us from the depths of national calamity, renewing our mighty economic strength and leading the way to restoring our respect in the world. They are an extraordinary breed we call Americans. So if there is any salute deserved tonight _ it's to the heroes everywhere in this land who make up the doers, the dreamers, and the life-builders without which our glorious experiment in democracy would have failed. So, this, this convention brings back so many memories for a fellow like me. I can still remember my first Republican convention. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> giving a speech that sent tingles down my spine. No, I have to confess, I was n't actually there. The truth is, way back then I belonged to the other party. But surely we can remember another convention. Eight years ago, we gathered in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in a troubled time for our beloved country.

 And we gathered solemnly to share our dreams. And, when I look back, I wonder if we dared be so bold to take on those burdens. But in that same city of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, when the 2Oth century was only in its second year, another great Republican, <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, told Americans not to hold back from dangers ahead, but to rejoice: `` ... our hearts lifted with the faith that to us and to our children ... it shall be given to make this republic the mightiest among the peoples of mankind,'' <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> said those years ago. In 1980, we needed every bit of that kind of faith. That year was our dream that together we could rescue <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and make a new beginning _ to create anew that shining city on a hill. The dream we shared was to reclaim our government _ to transform it from one that was consuming our prosperity into one that would get out of the way of those who created prosperity. It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national destiny. We made a determination that our dream would not be built on a foundation of sand _ something called `` trust me government'' _ but we would trust, instead, the American spirit. And, yes, we were unashamed in believing that this dream was driven by a community of shared values of family, work, neighborhood, peace, and freedom. And on the night of July l7, 1980, we left with a mutual pledge to conduct a national crusade to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> great again. We had faith, because the heroes in our midst had never failed us before. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> knew what these Americans with character of steel could do when he wrote: `` ... the harder the conflict, the more glorious the triumph.'' And my fellow citizens, while our triumph is not yet complete, the road has been glorious, indeed. Eight years ago, we met at a time when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was in economic chaos _ and today, we meet in a time of economic promise. We met then in international distress and today with global hope. Now, I think we can be forgiven if we engage in a little review of that history tonight. As the saying goes _ `` Just a friendly reminder.'' I've been doing a little remembering of my own because of all that inflated rhetoric by our friends in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month. But then, inflation is their specialty. Before we came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Americans had just suffered the two worst back-to-back years of inflation in 60 years. Those are the facts. And as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said: `` Facts are stubborn things.'' Interest rates had jumped to over 21 percent _ the highest in 120 years _ more than doubling the average monthly mortgage payments for working families _ our families. When they sat around the kitchen table, it was not to plan summer vacations, it was to plan economic survival. Facts are stubborn things. Industrial production was down, and productivity was down for two consecutive years. The average _ missed me -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded to a sound -RRB- _ the average weekly wage plunged 9 percent. Median family income fell 5 -LCB- percent. Facts are stubborn things.

 That was our change. So together we pulled out of a tailspin and created 17 -LCB- million good jobs. That's more than a quarter of a million new jobs a month _ every month _ for 68 consecutive months. America is working again. Just, and just since our 1984 convention, we have created over 11 million of those new jobs. Now, just why would our friends on the other side want to change that? Why do they think putting you out of work is better than putting you to work? New homes are being built. New car sales reached record levels. Exports are starting to climb again. Factory capacity is approaching maximum use. You know, I've noticed they do n't call it `` Reaganomics'' anymore. As, as for inflation _ well, that, too, has changed. We changed it from the time it hit 18 percent in 1980 _ down to between 3 -LCB- and 4 percent. Interest rates are less than half of what they were. In fact, in fact nearly half of all mortgages taken out on family homes in 1986 and more than a third of those in 1987 were actually old loans being refinanced at the new, lower rates. Young families have finally been able to get some relief. These, too, were our changes. We rebuilt our armed forces. We liberated <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> from the communists and helped return that island to democracy. We, we struck a firm blow against Libyan terrorism. We've seen the growth of democracy in 90 percent of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Soviets have begun to pull out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The bloody Iran-Iraq war is coming to an end. And for the first time in eight years we have the prospects of peace in southwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the removal of Cuban and other foreign forces from the region. And in the 2,765 days of our administration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists. Today _ -LRB- crowd chants, `` Four more years'' -RRB- _ today, today _ -LRB- crowd continues chant -RRB- _ today, today we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear missiles. We're working on the Strategic Defense Initiative to defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror, and American and Soviet relations are the best they've ever been since World War II. And virtually all this change occurred _ and continues to occur _ in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it's time for a change. They resisted our defense buildup; they resisted our tax cuts; they resisted cutting the fat out of government; and they resisted our appointments of judges committed to the law and the Constitution. And it's time for some more straight talk. This time it's about the budget deficit. Yes, it's much too high. But the president does n't vote for a budget, and the president ca n't spend a dime. Only the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can do that. They blame, they blame the defense increases for the deficit, yet defense spending today, in real dollars, is almost exactly what it was six years ago. In a six-year period, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut defense spending authority by over $ 125 billion. And for every $ 1 reduction in defense outlays, they added $ 2 to domestic spending. Now, if they had passed my first budget, my first spending plan in 1982, the cumulative outlays and deficits would have been $ 207 billion lower by 1986.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: by 1986.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Every single year I've been in office, I have supported and called for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and the liberals have said no every year. I've called for the line-item veto, which 43 governors have, to cut fat in the budget, and the liberals have said no. Every year, I have attempted to limit their wild spending sprees, and they've said no. They would have us believe that runaway budget deficits began in 1981 when we took office. Well, let me tell you something _ the fact is, when they began their war on poverty in the middle'60s, from 1965 through 1980 _ in just those 15 years _ the budgets increased to five times what they had been, and the deficits went up to 52 times what they had been before their war on poverty. Now, do n't we know that, if they're elected, their answer will be the one they have relied on in the past _ and that is higher taxes. The other party has controlled _ -LRB- crowd boos -RRB- _ the other party has controlled the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> for 52 out of the last 56 years. -LRB- Crowd boos again. -RRB- They've controlled the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also for 46 of those years. -LRB- Crowd boos again. -RRB- Where we really need a change is to elect <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> majorities in both houses. -LRB- Crowd cheers. -RRB- Then, and then, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can have a team that will protect your tax cuts, keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong, hold down inflation and interest rates, appoint judges to preserve your rights, and, yes, reduce the budget deficit. Early in the first term, we set out to reduce federal regulations that had been imposed on the people, on business, and on liberal and _ or, local and state governments. Today, I'm proud to say, that we have eliminated so many unnecessary regulations that government-required paperwork imposed on citizens, businesses, and other levels of government has been reduced by an estimated 600 million man-hours of paperwork a year. And <PERSON> George </PERSON> was there. -LRB- Crowd chants, `` Four more years.'' -RRB- No. You have n't heard it all yet. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed up that task force that eliminated those regulations. In 1980 and before, it took seven weeks to get a Social Security card. Now it takes 10 days. It only takes 10 days to get a passport. It used to take 43 days. It took 75 days to get an export license; now it's only 17 days, and for some countries, only five. It took over 100 days to process a claim for a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Title </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I </ORGANIZATION> loan _ 100 days. It now takes less than one-fourth of that _ 22 days. I think these specifics suggest there is a new level of competent management in the departments of our government. <PERSON> George </PERSON> played a major role in everything that we have accomplished in these eight years. Now, early on, we had a foreign policy problem. Our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies were under the threat of Soviet intermediate-range missiles, and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> had no equivalent deterrent. Our effort to provide a deterrent _ <LOCATION> Pershing </LOCATION> and ground-launched cruise missiles on the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> line _ resulted in political problems for our <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. There was objection on the part of many of their people to deployment of our missiles. <PERSON> George </PERSON> represented us in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> with the heads of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> countries, and they agreed when he finished to take the missiles. This subsequently persuaded the Soviets to sign the INF Treaty and begin removing their SS-20s. None of our achievements happened by accident, but only because we overcame liberal opposition to put our programs in place. And without <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to build on those policies, everything we've achieved will be at risk All the work, sacrifice and effort of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people could end in the very same disaster that we inherited in 1981. Because I feel so strongly about the work that must continue and the need to protect our gains for the American family and for national security, I want to share with you the qualities we should seek in the next president.

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: next president.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We need someone who's big enough and experienced enough to handle tough and demanding negotiations with Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> _ because this is no time to gamble with on-the-job training. We need someone who's prepared to be president and who has the commitment to stand up for you against massive new taxes and who will keep alive the hope and promise that keeps our economy strong. But it takes somebody who's this office from the inside, who senses the danger points, will be cool under fire and knows the range of answers when the tough questions come. Well, that's the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that I've seen up close _ when the staff and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members have closed the door and when the two of us are alone. Someone who is not afraid to speak his mind and who can cut to the core of an issue. Someone who never runs away from a fight, never backs away from his beliefs, and never makes excuses. This office is not mine to give _ only you, the people, can do that. But I love <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> too much and care too much about where we will be in the next few years. I care that we give custody of this office to someone who will build on our changes, not retreat to the past _ someone who will continue the change all of us fought for. To preserve what we have and not risk losing it all _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as first lady. -LRB- Crowd chants, `` Four more years.'' -RRB- All right. With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I'll know, as we approach the new millenium, our children will have a future secure with a nation at peace and protected against aggression; we'll have a prosperity that spreads the blessings of our abundance and opportunity across all <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; we'll have safe and active neighborhoods; drug-free schools that send our children soaring in the atmosphere of great ideas and deep values; and a nation confidently willing to take its leadership into the uncharted reaches of a new age. So, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, I'm in your corner. I'm ready to volunteer a little advice now and then, and offer a pointer or two on strategy, if asked. I'll help keep the facts straight or just stand back and cheer. But <PERSON> George </PERSON>, just one personal request: Go out there and win one for the Gipper. As you can imagine, I'm sorely tempted to spend the rest of this evening telling the truth about our friends who met in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> _ but, then, why should I have all the fun? So, for the next few moments, let's talk about the future. This is the last Republican convention I will address as president. Maybe you'll see your way to inviting me back sometime. But like so many of us, as I said earlier, I started out in the other party. But 40 years ago, I cast my last vote as a Democrat. It was a party in which <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> promised the return of power to the states. It was a party where <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> committed a strong and resolute <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to preserving freedom. F.D.R. had run on a platform of eliminating useless boards and commissions and returning autonomy and authority to local governments and to the states. That party changed _ and it will never be the same. They left me; I did n't leave them. So, it was our <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that gave me a political home. When I signed up for duty, I did n't have to check my principles at the door. And I soon found out that the desire for victory did not overcome our devotion to ideals.

<TEXT>
 And what ideals those have been. Our party speaks for human freedom _ for the sweep of liberties that are at the core of our existence. We do not shirk from our duties to preserve freedom so it can unfold across the world for yearning millions. We believe that lasting peace comes only through strength and not through the good will of our adversaries. We have a healthy skepticism of government _ checking its excesses at the same time we are willing to harness its energy when it helps improve the lives of our citizens. We have pretty strong notions that higher tax receipts are no inherent right of the federal government. We do n't think that inflation and high interest rates show compassion for the poor, the young, and the elderly. We respect the values that bind us together as families and as a nation. For our children _ we do n't think it's wrong to have them committed to pledging each day to the `` one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' And we have so many requirements in their classrooms, why ca n't we at least have one thing that is voluntary _ and that is allow our kids to repair quietly to their faith to say a prayer to start the day as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does For the unborn _ quite simply _ should n't they be able to live to become children in those classrooms? Those, those are some of our principles. You in this room, and millions like you watching and listening tonight, are selfless and dedicated to a better world based on these principles. You are n't quitters. You walk not just precincts, but for a cause. You stand for something _ the finest warriors for free government that I have known. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I thank you for letting us be a part of your tireless determination to leave a better world for our children. And that's why we're here, is n't it? A better world. I know I've said this before, but I believe that God put this land between the two great oceans to be found by special people from every corner of the world who had that extra love of freedom that prompted them to leave their homeland and come to this land to make it a brilliant light beam of freedom to the world. It's our gift to have visions, and I want to share that of a young boy who wrote to me shortly after I took office. In his letter he said, `` I love <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because you can join Cub Scouts if you want to. You have a right to worship as you please. If you have the ability, you can try to be anything you want to be. And I also like <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because we have about 200 flavors of ice cream.'' Truth, truth through the eyes of a child. Freedom of association. Freedom of worship. Freedom of hope and opportunity. And the pursuit of happiness _ in this case, choosing among 200 flavors of ice cream.

 That's <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Everyone with his or her vision of the American promise. That's why we're a magnet for the world _ for those who dodged bullets and gave their lives coming over the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and others, only a few of whom avoided death, coming in tiny boats on turbulent oceans. This land, its people, the dreams that unfold here and the freedom to bring it all together _ well, those are what make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> soar _ up where you can see hope billowing in those freedom winds. When our children turn the pages of our lives, I hope they'll see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect as we could Where there's decency, tolerance, generosity, honesty, courage, common sense, fairness, and piety. This is my vision, and I'm grateful to God for blessing me with a good life and a long one. But when I pack up my bags in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, do n't expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life. Twilight? Twilight? Not in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Here, it's a sunrise every day. Fresh new opportunities. Dreams to build. Twilight? That's not possible, because I confess there are times when I feel like I'm still little Dutch <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> racing my brother down the hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over the <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. You see, there's no sweeter day than each new one because here in our country, it means something wonderful can happen to you. And something wonderful happened to me. We lit a prairie fire a few years back. Those flames were fed by passionate ideas and convictions, and we were determined to make them run, burn I should say, all across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. And what times we've had. Together we've fought for causes we loved. But we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight, because the battle is never over. Our freedom must be defended over and over again. And then again. There's still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch, fences that need repair, and horses to ride. But I want you to know that if the fires ever dim, I'll leave my phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot soldier. Just let me know, and I'll be there _ as long as words do n't leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be special during its shining moment on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Twilight, you say? Listen to H.G. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. H.G. <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> says: `` The past is but the beginning of a beginning, and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn.'' Well, that's a new day _ our sunlit new day _ to keep alive the fire so that when we look back at the time of choosing, we can say that we did all that could be done. Never less. Thank you, good night. God bless you and God bless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Excerpts From Reagan's Speech</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the text of the speech by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to the Republican National Convention on Monday night. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I are so honored to be your guest tonight _ to share a little of your special time. And we thank you. ... ... Eight years ago, we gathered in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in a troubled time for our beloved country. ... That year, it was our dream that together we would rescue <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and make a New Beginning _ to create anew that shining city on a hill. ... It was a dream of again making our nation strong enough to preserve world peace and freedom and to recapture our national destiny. ... And on the night of July l7, 1980, we left with a mutual pledge to conduct a national crusade to make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> great again. ... And my fellow citizens, while our triumph is not yet complete, the road has been glorious, indeed. ... Before we came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Americans had just suffered the two worst back-to-back years of inflation in 60 years. Those are the facts. ... And as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said: `` Facts are stubborn things....'' ... When they sat around the kitchen table, it was not to plan summer vacations, it was to plan economic survival. ... When we met in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in that summer of 1980 _ it was a summer of discontent for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> around the world. Our national defense had been so weakened, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had begun to engage in reckless aggression. ... ... Our embassy in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was burned to the ground, and the one in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was stormed and occupied with all Americans taken as hostages. ... We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981; we focused on hope, not despair. ... We said something shocking. Taxes ought to be reduced, not raised. ... We rebuilt our armed forces. We liberated <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION> from the communists and helped return that island to democracy. We struck a firm blow against Libyan terrorism. We've seen the growth of democracy in 90 percent of <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Soviets have begun to pull out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The bloody Iran-Iraq war is coming to an end. For the first time in eight years we have the prospects of peace in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the removal of Cuban and other foreign forces from the region. And in the 2,765 days of our administration, not one inch of ground has fallen to the communists. Today, we have the first treaty in world history to eliminate an entire class of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear missiles. We are working on the strategic defense initiative to defend ourselves and our allies against nuclear terror, and American-Soviet relations are the best they've been since World War II. And virtually all this change occurred _ and continues to occur _ in spite of the resistance of those liberal elites who loudly proclaim that it's time for a change. ...

<HEAD>NEW ORLEANS: a change. ...</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 None of our achievements happened by accident ... Without <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to build on those policies, everything we have achieved will be at risk. ... It will take someone who has seen this office from the inside, who senses the danger points, will be cool under fire and knows the range of answers when the tough questions come. That's the <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> I've seen up close _ when the staff and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members have closed the door and when the two of us are alone. ... Someone who never runs away from a fight, never backs away from his beliefs, and never makes excuses. ... So, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, I'm in your corner. I'm ready to volunteer a little advice now and then, and offer a pointer or two on strategy, if asked. I'll help keep the facts straight or just stand back and cheer. But <PERSON> George </PERSON>, just one personal request: Go out there and make it one more for the Gipper. ... ... When I pack up my bags in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, do n't expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life. Twilight? Not in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Here, it's a sunrise every day. Fresh new opportunities. Dreams to build. Twilight? That's not possible, because I confess there are times when I feel like I'm still Dutch <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> racing my brother down the hill to the swimming hole under the railroad bridge over the <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. You see, there's no sweeter day than each new one because here in our country, it means something wonderful can happen to you. And something wonderful happened to me. We lit a prairie fire a few years back. Those flames were fed by passionate ideas and convictions, and we were determined to make them burn all across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. What times we've had! Together we've fought for causes we love. But we can never let the fire go out or quit the fight, because the battle is never over. Our freedom must be defended over and over again. And then again. There's still a lot of brush to clear out at the ranch, fences that need repair, and horses to ride. But I want you to know that if the fires ever dim, I'll leave my phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot soldier. Just let me know, and I'll be there _ as long as words do n't leave me and as long as this sweet country strives to be special during its shining moment on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Twilight, you say? Listen to H.G. Wells: `` The past is but the beginning of a beginning, and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn.'' That's a new day _ a sunlit new day _ to keep alive the fire so that we may look back at the time of choosing, we can say that we did all that could be done. Never less.

 Universal Pictures may have won a temporary financial victory with `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' but the film could be costly to the studio in the long-run, some fundamentalist religious leaders say. The movie played to sold-out crowds last week in seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and two in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, taking in $ 44,579 per screen for a three-day total of $ 401,211, Universal said. `` We're gratified at the response of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. Every show sold out. We're pleased,'' Universal President <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Exhibitor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which surveys box office performance, described the film's debut as phenomenal. `` This is a tremendous showing,'' he said. A movie in general release _ for example, one shown on 1,300 to 1,400 screens, `` is really something'' if it takes in $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 a screen, <PERSON> Krier </PERSON> said. `` With all this free publicity, of course they were full. But the more the Christian community sees this thing, the angrier they will get,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Tupelo </LOCATION>, Miss.-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The preacher is among several religious leaders who have labeled the film blasphemous and have urged urged a boycott of <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Universal's parent company. `` There's no question that in Round 1, the publicity that we generated created a lot of curiosity,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penland </PERSON>, who served as a religious consultant to Universal but later resigned to protest the film. `` It certainly appears we helped Universal,'' he said. But he predicted the adverse publicity will `` ultimately burn Universal.'' `` There comes a point where the publicity becomes damaging,'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> agreed. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said the demonstrations, which climaxed Thursday with a march on <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> by 25,000 Christians, are over. The next tactic will go beyond the boycott of Universal films, Universal Tours and appeals to <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, he said, adding he may disclose the next strategy later in the week. `` Christians are angry,'' <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- Universal -RRB- may realize short-term profits, but in the long-term they will hurt economically from this. The anger is building and this is n't going to be forgotten in two weeks.'' Some conservative Christians have denounced the movie for what they said was a blasphemous depiction of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, who is portrayed as fantasizing about abandoning death on the cross to live as a man and raise a family with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. Director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic, has said the movie is a work of fiction and was not made with blasphemous intent.

 A 7-year-old boy died from injuries sustained when a powerboat veered out of control and crashed into a crowd watching a speedboat race. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> died Monday of massive head trauma, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Free </PERSON>, spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Spraying Ordered to Eradicate White Fringe Beetle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pesticide spraying has been ordered for 600 acres following discovery of the crop-eating White Fringe Beetle, the first reported sighting of the pest in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, officials said. The beetle, which poses no danger to humans, was spotted by a homeowner in the <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION> area three weeks ago, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, deputy commission for <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. State agricultural officials determined last week that the bug was the White Fringe Beetle, which eats 300 varieties of crops and plants, he said Monday. The beetle, which is common to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, has a preference for alfalfa and peas, he said. Ground spraying of lawns and shrubs in a 600-acre area south of <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION> was to begin today, he said. `` Right now, even though we're seeing a large number of adults, we're not seeing that much damage on the plants at this point,'' he said. Spraying was expected to continue for three to four weeks.

<HEAD>Challenge To Entertainer's Will Nears End</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The executor of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s estate testified he did not know what was killing his famous client until told by a doctor after the entertainer had signed a new will 13 days before his death. The testimony by <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> came at the close of a long, bitter trial challenging the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, attorney's role as executor of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s vast estate. Both sides rested their case Monday after weeks of testimony that exposed the private life of the flamboyant entertainer who died Feb. 4, 1987, of complications of AIDS. Closing arguments were scheduled for this afternoon in state <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>. It will then be up to Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> to determine whether <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> should be removed as executor of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> estate and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> foundation. `` I was told by Dr. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> after the will signing the condition that Mr. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> had,'' Strote testified Monday. He did not elaborate on what he was told. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was `` very concerned about privacy'' as rumors surfaced months before his death that he was suffering from AIDS. `` Mr. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> did n't want anyone to know how sick he was,'' <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> said. He said secrecy was a key when <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was admitted to <LOCATION> Eisenhower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in late January 1987 for blood transfusions. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> testified he had drawn up wills for <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> prior to the one that was drafted in mid-January and signed by the entertainer Jan. 22, 1987. That will left <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> in charge of the estate. Under cross-examination, the attorney testified the previous wills had precluded him from appointing himself as executor. Earlier Monday, an accountant testified that <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Angie </PERSON>, one of the five plaintiffs in the case, has been paid nearly $ 132,000 since his death and has $ 511,000 left in her trust account. The testimony conflicted with that given last week by <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, 74, who described herself as `` penniless.'' The sister and four former associates are seeking to have <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> removed, saying <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was too ill to comprehend what he was doing when he signed the documents drafted by <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Audiences Not Tempted By Traditional Religious Films</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Biblical film epics were once a staple of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s success formula, but in recent years they have n't had a prayer at the box office. So judging from the phenomenal start of `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' the controversy surrounding the film looks like manna from heaven for <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. Straightforward religious films, like Westerns, are failing to attract the viewers they did in the days of <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMille </PERSON>'s `` The Ten Commandments,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyler </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hur </PERSON>'' and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' `` The Greatest Story Ever Told. They garnered huge audiences in the 1950s and early'60s. In 1985, `` King <PERSON> David </PERSON>,'' a big-budget saga starring <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gere </PERSON>, bombed. Two years later, `` The Mission,'' featuring <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeNiro </PERSON> and themes strongly endorsed by Christian leaders, also flopped. But director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s `` Last Temptation,'' denounced as blasphemous by some Christian leaders, opened to packed houses last weekend. It played in seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and two in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, taking in $ 44,579 per screen for a three-day total of $ 401,211, a jubilant <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` I think if ` The Mission' came out 10-12 years ago, it would have received a larger general audience,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penland </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Penland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, specializing in the marketing of Christian films. `` Had the film not been perceived as a religious epic, it could have done better business.'' Part of the problem, <PERSON> Penland </PERSON> said, is that today's moviegoers tend to avoid films that have overt religious messages. Another sign of the times: Evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is quietly retrenching from his effort to use film as a tool for spreading a spiritual message. Even as `` Last Temptation'' is drawing big crowds to see a story about a <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> plagued by human doubt, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> is shutting down the <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> studios of his religious film production company, considered the world's largest. `` Our -LRB- movie -RRB- attendance has not been what <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> would consider to be large,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON>, director of distribution and operations for <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Worldwide's <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> production studio was shut in May, a move brought on by tight finances More than a dozen employees were laid off, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said. Only one employee remains in the offices. <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> added that some of the studio's duties will be assumed at <LOCATION> Graham </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The Burbank production site will soon be put up for sale and no plans for another Worldwide feature film are in the offing. Worldwide, instead, will devote its filmmaking energies to low-budget films for showings in churches, prisons and nursing homes, <PERSON> Kurtz </PERSON> said. Started in the 1950s, Worldwide was envisioned by <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> as a modern proselytizing tool. The idea sometimes worked. Worldwide's `` The Hiding Place,'' a 1975 inspirational movie on Dutch Christians sheltering Jews in World War II, did respectable business and received satisfactory reviews. But `` Caught,'' a 1987 Worldwide release about a boy looking for life's answers in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, was a commericial failure and was panned. The film, starring <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireland </PERSON>, stopped at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> theaters only briefly and is scheduled for an October release in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Worldwide's dwindling fortunes are not isolated. `` Going to see a religious film is not high on anybody's list, especially when you see how many films are out there for theatrical release,'' <PERSON> Penland </PERSON> said. `` No matter how much they -LRB- Worldwide -RRB- tried to hide it, audiences saw their films as extensions of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. `` I think we've reached a period -LRB- in religious filmmaking -RRB- where to attract an audience, we have to have mainstream appeal.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> today prohibited 14 relatives of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> from leaving the country while the government investigates alleged corruption by <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family. The travel ban followed a resolution passed Aug. 4 by a special <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> committee in a move to force the former president to testify about corruption under his administration. Ministry officials said <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his wife were excluded from the travel ban as they deserved due courtesy. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> left office in February at the end of a seven-year term. Among <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s 14 relatives subject to the ban were <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s two brothers, a father-in-law and several brothers-in-law and their wives. All 14 are under investigation for alleged corruption. The opposition has denounced <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his family over allegations of widespread corruption and financial scandals. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyong-hwan </PERSON>, is on trial on charges of embezzling millions of dollars in his former position as head of a rural development group The opposition wants the ex-president to testify before the opposition-controlled assembly about the allegations, but President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s governing party opposes the idea. A former army general, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> played a key role in helping <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> seize power with military backing in 1980. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> won election in December last year over divided opposition candidates. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Soon-ja </PERSON>, and her family have been under public fire for alleged influence-peddling and corruption during her husband's administration. Also today, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s governing party proposed a parliamentary probe of allegations that <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s family sent fortunes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>.

 As <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` Win one for the Gipper'' in November, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Unangst </PERSON> raised his sweating beer can with an aging athlete's bravado. `` Punchline,'' <PERSON> Unangst </PERSON> yelled toward a television at Mother's, a 50-year-old eatery at Tchoupitoulas and Poydras streets that proclaims the coldest beer and the world's best baked ham. He took a long, loud sip, then professed gridiron kinship with the former <ORGANIZATION> Eureka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> player whose exhortation to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mimicked a line from one his movies. `` I played football, too,'' <PERSON> Unangst </PERSON> said. `` Touchdown! Great speech.'' Mother's is about a dozen blocks from the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Superdome, where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s emotional farewell was cheered Monday night by delegates to the Republican National Convention. The fuzzy presidential image came from a small television set, rigged high on a wall between a velvet toy elephant head and a sign that warned, `` Caution: Men Drinking.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s goodbye played to a near-empty house at Mother's `` because all the Republicans are still up the street,'' said owner <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> was braced for a crush of convention visitors after the nightly session ended. Cooks popped pans of biscuits into the oven, and chopped vegetables for the anticipated late diners. For now, <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> could relax at a table near the front door, puffing a long brown cigar and philosophizing about politics. `` Me, I'm not political. Not in the party sense _ ` I vote this way or that way.' I'll just walk in the booth and pull the lever, maybe Republican, maybe for the Democrats,'' he said. `` But I do n't mind watching the speech, although we've been seeing nothing but Republicans,'' <PERSON> Amato </PERSON> said with a laugh. `` Besides, there's really nothing else on television.'' `` A beer and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ what could be more fun than this?'' said customer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordelon </PERSON> as he dug into a bowl of ham and cabbage. But Mother's bartender <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> was reverent. A former Marine who saw <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> combat in World War II, he confessed to emotional twinges every time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> talks patriotism. `` Same thing tonight,'' said <PERSON> Landry </PERSON>, 64. `` It's very touching. It goes right through me. It makes me proud to be an American.'' How will he vote? `` It was the Democrats that sent me to war, not the Republicans. But who knows? I'll decide election day,'' <PERSON> Landry </PERSON> said. The door swung open and in walked the first post-session diners, easily identified by credentials dangling from their necks. It was back to business at Mother's.

 `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' is back on Broadway with the same bright cast and even more uninhibited gusto than it had 10 years ago. The revue of songs that <PERSON> Fats </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> composed or turned into hit records opened at the Ambassador Theater on Monday night. It's infectious, high-energy, spirited entertainment The bright cast of five singers, their movements by choreographer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Faria </PERSON> carefully rehearsed, give the show a real team feeling. But, like a decade ago, it's <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, with her <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merman-like </PERSON> vocal attack, who's the home-run hitter. When she sings `` Ow,'' to start `` I've Got a Feeling I'm Falling,'' it's with the sharp surprise of someone who's just been stuck with a pin The audience breathes out in delighted response. She also stopped the show with her brash `` Cash for Your Trash'' and vulnerable `` Mean to Me.'' The singers look like they're having fun. There's a mischievous sexiness to <PERSON> Armelia </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON>'s giggly singing of <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>'s `` Squeeze Me,'' and to <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s rendition of `` Honeysuckle Rose.'' <PERSON> Charlaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON> chooses sweet, demure vocal delivery for `` Keepin' Out of Mischief Now.'' As the other two women appear to have lost no weight in 10 years, Miss <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON> seems not to have gained any. Page, who was Old Deutertonomy in the original Broadway cast of `` Cats,'' makes the most of the jolliest of the novelty songs, `` Your Feet's Too Big.'' Singer-dancer <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> is snakily sinuous in `` The Viper's Drag.'' <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, who did the musical arrangements when `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' started at the off-Broadway <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and was the first pianist on Broadway, played on-stage piano Six other musicians were across the back of the stage. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Fats'' <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>, stride pianist, composer, singer and movie performer, was born in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> in 1904 and died on an eastbound train from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1943. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Maltby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> directed the show of his music and the <ORGANIZATION> Shubert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Azenberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlind </PERSON> produced. `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' won a Tony Award in 1978 as best musical and ran for three years. The original singers stayed in it for nine months. This time, they spent two months on the road and came to Broadway for a limited engagement, through November. Delights of `` Ai n't Misbehavin''' are n't confined to solos. There's the brassy, nearly naughty `` Find Out What They Like'' by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> McQueen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, the shim sham danced by the three women, the ensemble's `` Lounging at the Waldorf'' and `` The Joint Is Jumpin'.'' It sure is. In other reviews: <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> wrote that this revival lacks the restraint of the original production. `` This time, the show seems less an ensemble performance, more like a series of star turns. ... `` Even with its lapses, ` Ai n't Misbehavin'' is, for sheer entertainment, the best value on Broadway.'' In The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, wrote: `` ` Ai n't Misbehavin'' is so torrid that it may be the only place in town where you feel happy to be hot. ... `` What's even more impressive about the revival is how little it seems like a rehash. ... The original on and off stage artists have returned not only in force but in high gear as well.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Stasio </PERSON> called it `` a bona-fide recreation of the spirit and the artistry that made the show such a joy the first time around.''

<HEAD>Bomb Believed Planted By Tamil Rebels Kills Six</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A time bomb believed planted by Tamil rebels exploded in a crowd of office-goers in the eastern port city of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> today, killing at least six people and injuring 10, military officials said. All the victims were believed to be government employees on their way to work, said officials at <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>'s military command. The officials can not be identified under briefing rules. The explosion occurred at the city's busy <LOCATION> Clock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tower </LOCATION> area, where many government employees disembark from city buses, the officials said. Most of the government employees reporting for work in the city belong to the Sinhalese community. Tamils refused to work for the government after a Sinhalese mob killed three members of their community in the city on July 21. Last week, authorities ordered all employees to report to work and promised them maximum protection. But the rebels challenged the order and warned government staff against complying. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people but are in a majority in the island's north and east. Tamil radicals have been agitating for an independent homeland since 1983, claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has sent a letter to black <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers expressing regret for a Japanese politician's degrading remarks about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said today. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said in a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, that he was `` saddened that a recent event has hurt our friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' according to the ministry official, who read excerpts of the letter. `` It is regrettable a misunderstanding arose,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> wrote, adding that there is no justification for racial discrimination. `` I hope to make the partnership between our two countries even stronger,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> wrote. `` America is a great country made up of numerous ethnic groups, and I want to work hard to heighten Japanese people's awareness of this.'' The letter was delivered Friday to <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., through the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s message was sparked by a letter from <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> complaining of remarks by <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, policy chief of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and calling on the prime minister to clarify <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s position toward <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> minorities. <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> seminar last month that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and implied they walk away from their debts. He quickly apologized for his comments, but anger built up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and public over what were seen as racist remarks. Two years ago, then Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> stirred a similar controversy when he said the overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence rate was brought down by the large numbers of blacks, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans living in the country. <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> later apologized for his comments.

<HEAD>Armenian Expelled From Soviet Union Vows to Continue Struggle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost'' is just a gimmick in the eyes of an Armenian activist who was expelled from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Paruyr Ayrikyan called the policy of openness, `` cosmetics'' and `` an enterprise to make the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> look nicer than it is. ... In general, there is still a one-party system.'' And he vowed to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to rally support for his cause until he can return home. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> was stripped of his Soviet citizenship and expelled from the country on July 21. Last week, a high-ranking Soviet legal official said <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>'s appeal to be readmitted, filed at the Soviet consulate in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, was not being taken seriously. In an interview here Monday, <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said he does not expect to be allowed to return home soon. He denounced the terms of his ejection and vowed to ask governments and private groups for financial and political support for Armenian rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The 39-year-old former translator said he would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for money to maintain an office and cover printing costs, and seek to bring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on Soviet officials. `` The Soviet government respects only a position of strength,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter. As for his own case, he said he has written a letter asking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` to raise this question on an international level, particularly at the international conference on human rights in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and in your meetings with the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION>, so that this illegal decision -LRB- will -RRB- be overturned and that I -LRB- will -RRB- be allowed the right to return to the U.S.S.R.'' <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said he would be Soviet Armenians' representative in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and hoped `` to regularly communicate with the government in such a capacity.'' Although he said he did not expect to be formally recognized as a diplomat, `` de facto, I am in such a position.'' The Armenian activist was arrested in March for his part in spreading word to <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> journalists about the Armenian campaign to have a mostly Armenian region of the neighboring <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> made part of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Ethnic rioting killed at least 35 people in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> after Armenians launched the annexation campaign in February. Although <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> was not a leader of the uprising, he has been a subject of popular support, and after his arrest many demonstrators made his release one of their demands. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said that within the week he would move to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Asked why he thought he was forced into exile, he said, `` They were planning to try me and they realized it was impossible because of broad public support for me. They realized they could n't try me, they could n't release me, so they decided to exile me.''

<HEAD>Report: Grand Jury Voted To Subpoena Tawana Brawley</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A special state grand jury has voted to subpoena <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, the black teen-ager who says she was raped by whites but refuses to cooperate with an investigation, a newspaper reported today. The vote, against the advice of Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, was taken last week in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION> but was not announced, said The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family spokesman, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> will continue her refusal to cooperate with the grand jury. `` We may decide to let her be serviced -LRB- with a subpoena -RRB- and then fight,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said, adding that he would hold a news conference today to discuss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family options. The subpoena requires <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to draw up a court order directing the 16-year-old to testify before the grand jury, the Times said. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> and her family's advisers have sought to rally public opinion against what they contend is a racially motivated cover-up by officials protecting the alleged assailants. As a result, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> as a special prosecutor for the case. The grand jury has been trying since February to learn why Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found last November in a plastic bag, smeared with excrement and racial epithets after a four-day disappearance. She said she had been raped repeatedly by five or six white men, at least one with a police-type badge. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> to `` make a kite out of his subpoena and I'll provide the string. `` They certainly set up a situation for a confrontation and we may take them up on it,'' <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> added. `` It looks like every time we think it's boiling down, they make a move.'' Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> is out-of-state with her mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who was subpoenaed but refused to testify, causing her to be sentenced to 30 days in jail. She has avoided jail by first staying in churches and later leaving the state.

<HEAD>Networks Feel Used and Abused, but Find Veepstakes Fascinating</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The networks felt used, abused and manipulated by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential mystery tour, but they found it far more interesting than most of what went on at the Republican National Convention on Monday night. When dealing with another piece of manipulated media _ a laudatory film about President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ the networks found it easy to turn away. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> chopped up the film into news reports, while <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> filled the time with a taped interview of <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and belatedly tuned in for the end of the film. Vice presidential trial balloons filled the airwaves Monday night, as likely candidates traipsed through the network booths or were tracked down by floor reporters. No one seemed more unhappy about this than the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> crew, which vigorously pursued vice-presidential speculation and self-promotion for almost all of the first hour. The point of the vice-presidential secret, as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign freely admits, is to hype TV ratings _ `` and to do that by keeping us talking about the running mate. So far it seems to be working,'' reporter <PERSON> Brit </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> complained earlier in the evening on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight. `` In other words, Brit, an exercise in manipulating the media,'' anchor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said. `` Indeed, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, and I have to say, I think we are being manipulated,'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said. And, as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> says, we all know how painful that can be. CBS anchor <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> made the same point in passing, calling the vice presidential secret the `` orchestrated, manipulated mystery of this convention.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> opened its prime-time coverage with an interview of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> started with a report from <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> that the big announcement might come Wednesday, instead of Thursday as promised. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> grilled Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, who then turned around and chatted with CBS. If <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has hopes for the vice-presidential nomination, she did n't get much help. Only CBS tuned in on her speech to the convention, but all three networks welcomed her husband, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, into their booths to boost his candidacy. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> noted later in the evening that <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> seemed to have shot himself in the foot by complaining to home state reporters that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection process was `` demeaning.'' Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> managed to get his speech on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, while CBS filled that time talking to Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> about why he wanted <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to be the vice presidential nominee. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> added some puzzling background to this media flurry. Both <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1976 and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1980 waited until the last day to pick their running mates, <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON> said, and they won, while <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> announced his choice in advance, and lost. The pursuit of the big tease reached comic proportions when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was detected talking on the telephone with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, his campaign manager. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and CBS were there first, poking microphones at <LOCATION> Atwater </LOCATION>, then at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> as they passed the phone around. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> was last on the scene, and nearly fell over a row of chairs thrusting his microphone at the telephone. Then he tried to grab the phone. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, for once in your life cool it a minute,'' barked <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who clearly enjoyed the scene. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> then said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would, indeed, announce his choice on Thursday. `` The vice president is teasing us, trying to keep the nation watching,'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> complained. None of the networks bit on the 20-minute <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> film. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenfield </PERSON>, who used parts of the film for a report on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> image, noted that most of this film was scavenged from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1984 film. The only images from the second term, he noted, were <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and a short scene of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lecturing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about its budget methods. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Plante </PERSON> also cut up the film for a news report while delegates watched the whole film _ which was available to television audiences on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and C-SPAN.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Flood Victims Expected To Die Because Of Dirty Water</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of peasant adults and children forced to drink dirty water because of widespread flooding are expected to die of water-borne epidemics, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> health official says. Incidents of malaria, typhoid and cholera have been on the rise since flooding earlier this month left 1.5 million people homeless, Dr. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> adviser on diarrheal diseases and immunization, said Monday. `` If some infected person is passing cholera into the water that his community drinks, every person in that community can get very sick very quickly,'' he told reporters at WHO offices in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> predicted 400,000 people, most of them under age 5, will develop diarrhea and other gastrointestinal diseases, and 4,000 of them will die. Left untreated, as many as 40,000 people could perish, said <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> from his base in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> to help coordinate the government's response to the health crisis. The government has recruited 300 extra doctors and medical students for about 120 emergency clinics and increase staff at 127 already-existing health units, he said. Non-governmental relief organizations, including the Sudanese <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>, the Sudanese Council of Churches and the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also have organized dozens of health clinics in squatter camps ringing <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. The sprawling settlements of mud huts and papyrus and burlap lean-tos were hardest hit by the deluge that destroyed 167,000 homes and killed at least 58 people, according to government figures. The more than 500,000 people living in the camps _ mostly peasants who fled drought and civil war in southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> _ also are threatened by epidemic. The government, seeking to discourage the settlements, forbids squatters to dig wells. Consequently, they must either beg for water or buy it from people who transport it from the distant <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on donkey-drawn carts. Since the floods, the price of water has soared to as much as $ 5 per 1.3-gallon jug, 10 times its value before the deluge. Those unable to pay the price have been forced to drink water from the huge, brackish pools left behind by the rainstorm and contaminated by excreta floating up from swamped pit latrines. Dr. <PERSON> Afaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahya </PERSON>, health coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization's 23 health clinics each have been reporting 150 or more cases of diarrhea and gastrointestinal diseases a day since the floods. Diarrhea kills the young and the weak through dehydration, and rehydration salts are the main therapy given patients, she said. `` But if you want to rehydrate people, you have to provide clean water,'' <PERSON> Yahya </PERSON> said. Nearly 100 cargo planes carrying emergency aid, including water tanks, have arrived since the floods, but distribution of relief supplies has been slow. Non-government agencies this weekend began distributing tents, blankets, food, and other supplies. But most of the needy have yet to be reached. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said relief efforts are being expanded to cover 200,000 people and appealed for further donations of emergency supplies. More than 100 tons of supplies have been airlifted into <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, and international donors have contributed about $ 950,000 following an Aug. 9 appeal by the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. Many roads were made impassable by the rains and some settlements left isolated and unreachable by huge lakes of knee-high water. The lack of telecommunications knocked out by the rains further hampers coordination of the relief effort. While the sun steadily evaporates the remaining vast pools, more rains have been forecast into September, posing a further threat to the swollen Nile already dangerously brimming near street level in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government To Stop Banks Handling Guerrilla Funds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government plans new laws to stop banks from handling funds of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitaries and other guerrilla groups in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The government also intends to set up a special force to combat guerrilla racketeering in the strife-torn <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. The plans were outlined in a letter Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> sent to the Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON>, a legislator from the province's largest Protestant party, the Official Unionists. Her 10 Downing St. office made the contents of the letter available to reporters on Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in the letter that planned statutes will prohibit banks, other financial institutions, accountants and financial advisers from handling the funds of guerrilla groups and empower the government to seize the assets of convicted guerrillas. The letter says the government also plans to set up a special force to combat extortion and fund-raising rackets by the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and rival <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> organizations. It described the planned new force as a `` purpose-designed, administrative, anti-racketeering body.'' British press reports said the new force will involve customs and tax officers and the Department of Social Security. The Republic of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> passed legislation in 1985 enabling the <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> government to seize money suspected of being used by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, which is outlawed on both sides of the Irish border. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the overwhelmingly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> under socialist rule. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s letter was in response to complaints by <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> that her government was n't taking tough enough measures to combat the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and other outlawed organizations. Racketeering is widespread in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The British news and current affairs magazine The Listener this year said protection rackets on construction sites in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> plus cash collected from stores, bars, taxis and clubs netted guerrillas on both sides of the sectarian divide an estimated $ 51 million a year. It said 95 percent of construction sites in the province's capital <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> are involved in protection rackets It said the standard charge per site demanded by racketeers is an initial $ 5,100 plus up to $ 680 a week.

<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy judge ordered 108-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> closed after it failed to come up with the $ 1.85 million needed to cover its 1988-89 deficit. Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> on Monday ordered <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s 16-month-old reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code coverted to Chapter 7, involuntary bankruptcy. School officials agreed, but reserved the right to move the case back to Chapter 11 if $ 2 million could be raised quickly. Despite frantic fund-raising efforts during the past year, including T-shirt sales outside the federal courthouse Monday afternoon, officials of the predominantly black school failed to get the funds <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said was needed by the hearing. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, said the school's best hope was financial and administrative support of local business leaders. `` I think there are some discussions going on along those lines,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, but added he did n't know who, if anyone, would come forward with the money. `` You have an institution that has a particular kind of heritage and that has done a particular kind of job in preparing for participation in the culture that has been lost,'' said Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, chairman of <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s board of trustees. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, with academic specialties in religion and education, was the only predominantly black school in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` I think there is a real need for <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area,'' Mayor <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said. `` I hope it can be reorganized at a later time. It's a good school. It serves a good purpose.'' Security guards Monday evening turned away visitors to the school's unmowed, boarded-up campus. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McElreath </PERSON>, the federal bankruptcy trustee overseeing the case, said attorneys told him this weekend that donations had increased to about $ 7,000 per day during the past few weeks, `` but that's not enough.'' After the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> revoked the college's accreditation because of the financial difficulties, Bishop officials filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April 1987. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> had since tried to pay off an estimated $ 18 million in debts. The college was founded in <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> in 1881 and moved to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1961. It has been troubled by financial problems and declining enrollment for a decade. Enrollment peaked at 1,500 in 1967 and dropped to about 300 students last spring. `` It's a sad day,'' Bishop senior <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Croomes </PERSON> said. `` I was hoping something positive would come out of it. It's time for me to move on, go to another school.''

<HEAD>Bring A Bankroll To Let The Good Times Roll</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Throwing exclusive parties at exotic locations during the Republican National Convention means forking over a bankroll before the good times can roll. For example, it costs $ 5,000 to rent the New Orleans Museum of Art for two hours. But do n't use that `` R'' word around <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Keevers </PERSON>. `` We prefer to say donation, instead of rent,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Keevers </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the 1912 museum, scene of elaborate bashes during the four-day convention. Food, drinks and entertainment are extra. Museum donors on Monday were the Eagle Forum, a conservative group headed by activist <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senatorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION>, whose membership fee is a $ 1,000 contribution to elect <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senators. Today's museum agenda included a reception and banquet for the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by former <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>. Women in frilly hoop skirts greeted Eagle Forum guests, who hailed Republican celebrities such as Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, and former federal Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, an unsuccessful nominee for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The VIPs were presented with four-faced clocks, which Mrs. <PERSON> Schlafly </PERSON> said would keep them on time as they travel cross-country in support of the party's ticket. Later in the evening, the senatorial shindig provided masks of purple, green and gold _ the officials colors of <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> _ for about 1,000 guests, some in colorful costumes. `` The ladies get a kick out of these.'' Washington-based party consultant <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pangburn </PERSON> said as she distributed the masks. `` The men seem to try to put them in their pockets.'' Arriving dignitaries were met by an 18-foot-high trailer-mounted King <PERSON> Kong </PERSON> that customarily travels in <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> Gras parades. Next to it was a 12-foot cartoon alligator on wheels, wearing a red necktie and holding, appropriately, a money bag. Four elephant float decorations flanked the wide marble entrance steps. A pair of beefeater mannequins, also borrowed from a float, were silent sentries next to red and white striped guardhouses. Inside, workers trimmed a sweeping central staircase dominated by a portrait of <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Antoinette </PERSON> to fit the Mardi Gras theme. Caterer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> fretted that delegates might burn out on plentiful Creole and Cajun food. `` And they've only been here a couple of days. So I'm changing tonight's menu,'' he said. Out with gumbo and jambalaya. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>'s Panache Caterers prepared stir-fried chicken and peanuts, pasta topped with spicy ham, and fried pork rinds. He swore pork skins were on the menu before Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared they were a favorite snack. `` But we are serving more of them,'' <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>'s company is catering for 14,000 people during five days. `` Tonight's a slow evening _ only 1,500 to cook for,'' he said. But do n't ask about price: `` If I said how much I'd be killed,'' <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> said. `` But this senatorial thing is a relatively elaborate party. And I ca n't say we are doing any low-budget ones.''

 More than 10,000 people came to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> hoping for a miracle, and after a dramatic evening Mass during the Feast of the Assumption, most were n't disappointed Shortly after Monday's mass began, some worshipers gasped and pointed skyward. Others looked and began shouting, `` It's <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, look!'' As the excitement brought the Mass to a halt, scores of pilgrims cried and applauded, claiming to see apparitions of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. `` I knew there would be a miracle, I just knew it,'' said <PERSON> Mamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fertitta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, crying and pointing to the sky. She said the saw the sun pulsating and then saw <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. A dozen priests standing on a rooftop altar and 600 Eucharist ministers turned their backs to the crowd to look at the sky and wave. After minutes of silence, the pastor, Monsignor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, facing the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> where people were pointing, began to sing `` Amazing Grace.'' People in the audience whipped out cameras to photograph the clouds and light. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 13, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said she saw <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> as the sun burst through the clouds. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> `` had a grayish-white beard and he's got some kind of cape on. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s wearing a crown,'' she said. `` I saw baby <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> for an instant in the sky,'' said <PERSON> Koreth </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargahese </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. For the estimated 12,000 people, the pilgrimage was prompted by reports that a miracle would occur on Monday's Feast of the Assumption, the day Catholics celebrate <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s assumption into Heaven. The charismatic parish has been the focus of national attention after three parishioners began reporting receiving messages of peace and hope from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> this spring. While many cried and pointed skyward, not everyone saw an apparition in the sky. `` I did n't see anything, but some of the other priests did,'' said <PERSON> Deacon </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>. Before the Mass, thousands streamed onto the church grounds despite temperatures in the high 90s as busloads brought pilgrims from around the country. Many of the worshipers were handicapped, who came seeking healing. Rosaries were said throughout the day in Spanish, English, French, Portuguese and Vietnamese. <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> had originally planned to preside over the feast day Mass, but decided not to following the publicity about the messages. He has urged people to treat the messages with caution and has not endorsed the happenings at the church.

<HEAD>Southern Baptist Break Said to Be First in the Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILOXI, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of a breakaway Baptist church says his new congregation is the first of what will be a growing split between moderate and fundamentalist Southern Baptists. `` We have taken the first step,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. `` We are the first church aligned with the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> that is not a part of the Southern Baptist Convention.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, also said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> may be the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> case of a pastor making a public break because of recent denominational events. The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> is a national group made up primarily of moderate Baptists. Moderate members have dissented publicly against the denomination's fundamentalist leaders. The Southern Baptist Convention is the denominational unit that manages the educational and missions programs of about 36,000 churches. It is the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination and has an estimated 15 million members. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> resigned as pastor of <LOCATION> Biloxi </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> last month because of policy disagreements with <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> leadership. He said about a dozen Southern Baptist families met for services in a rented <LOCATION> Gulfport </LOCATION> hall last week. Each Southern Baptist church operates autonomously. But the churches finance national programs through the convention's boards and agencies. Since 1979, fundamentalist-backed candidates have been elected president of the convention. They have the power to influence the appointment of trustees to convention boards and agencies. The new congregation, called <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, will issue papers on theology and other church matters. `` The basic question is this: Will the real Baptist please stand up? I believe that I am a real traditional Baptist,'' said <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said his key points of disagreement with the Southern Baptist Convention include inerrancy, or the literal interpretation of the Bible.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the largest guerrilla group fighting the Vietnamese in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, has declared support for international guarantees to prevent it from abusing other groups in post-war <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. In a peace proposal, the movement that ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in a three-year reign of terror until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded a decade ago, even suggested it would reduce its army to the level of other factions as part of a political settlement. The proposal, dated Monday and signed by nominal leader <PERSON> Khieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samphan </PERSON>, was broadcast over <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> radio that day. A text was obtained today from a Western embassy in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The proposal was the group's most direct, unequivocal response to widespread concerns that it may try to return to power once a settlement to the nearly decade-old war is reached. It appeared to put the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s public position in line with views of its guerrilla partners and the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and Western nations that back the guerrillas. During its rule, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> massacred hundreds of thousands of people and devastated society and culture as leader <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> tried to impose radical communal agrarianism. Fears of its return have recently been fueled by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s announced plans to withdraw some 50,000 troops, or half its force in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, by the end of the year and its pledge of a total pullout by early 1990 Some diplomats say the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, which fields some 35,000 guerrillas, is storing arms for an all-out offensive in 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> proposal said that after a political settlement is agreed to, an international conference should be convened to find measures to guarantee the agreement and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s independence, neutrality and territorial integrity It said the conference should be attended by countries involved in the conflict, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general and the permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>: <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The security council members should guarantee the agreement, it said. The proposal said the conference should set up an international body under either the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> or other international committees, `` and adopt measures agreed upon by all four Cambodian parties and countries attending the international conference to ensure that -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- does not abuse other parties and that other Cambodian parties do not abuse one another, and at the same time to ensure that -LRB- <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> -RRB- can not return to commit aggression against <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' The four Cambodian parties are the Vietnamese-installed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and its non-communist partners in a guerrilla coalition government: the forces of Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> and of Son <PERSON> Sann </PERSON>. The proposal said that in the last phase of a Vietnamese withdrawal, both the resistance government and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s pro-Vietnamese government should be dissolved simultaneously A provisional four-party government headed by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> then would be formed to organize elections for a new government, it said. The armies of the four factions would be put in garrisons under the control and supervision of a four-party Cambodian committee and international auspices. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> army is by far the most powerful of the four factions. `` In the preliminary stage, a four-party Cambodian army should be set up with each party having equal strength under a four-party high command,'' the proposal said. `` In accordance with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s constitution promulgated by the constitutional assembly, a single national army should be restored.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> has been increasingly diplomatically isolated in recent months, and parties attending unprecedented multilateral peace talks last month in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> agreed the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops must be linked with measures to prevent the return of <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> practices. <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s pro-Vietnamese government called at the talks for `` elimination'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s top leadership and dissolution of its army. At the talks, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> clashed bitterly with the government and with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. Also attending the talks were the other guerrilla groups, and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which has only recently unequivocally stated that while it backed the guerrillas, it favored measures to ensure the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> does not return to power. <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> groups <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>'s strongest supporter and main source of arms, stated for the first time recently that it did not favor the group's dominance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Zoo Director Lashes Out At Report About Hunger At Beijing Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The director of the country's largest zoo denies a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> newspaper report that inflation has stopped his tigers from eating live chicken and his elephants from munching bananas. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Zoo director <PERSON> Feng </PERSON> <PERSON> Youlian </PERSON> was quoted in Tuesday's edition of the Guangming Daily as saying his animals have `` never known hunger. He criticized an Aug. 8 report in the official, English-language <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, that said the 3,000 animals, birds and fish at the zoo have fallen on lean days because of inadequate funding and sharp rises in food prices. The <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily report said elephants were forced to eat carrots instead of their favorite, bananas. And it said tigers, lions and other carnivores were once treated twice weekly to a live chicken, now feast on such delicacies only when they are sick. `` Even during the ` three difficult years,' our animals have never known hunger,'' <PERSON> Feng </PERSON> said, referring to a famine that hit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from 1960 to 1963. `` Many animals at the zoo are presents from heads of foreign countries and some are rare animals on the brink of extinction,'' he was quoted as saying. `` As a result, we can cut down on other things but one thing that wo n't drop is the amount we spend on the animals' food.'' Inflation `` could affect some capital construction projects,'' <PERSON> Feng </PERSON> said, `` but never the stomachs of our beasts.'' Feng said the zoo received $ 176,000 from the government for non-staple foods in 1985. That figure jumped to $ 189,000 in 1987. He said that since 1965, the goverment's subsidy to the zoo has grown 12 times although the number of animals has only doubled. In addition, he added, the zoo's entrance fee of 10 fen -LRB- less than a nickel -RRB- has not been raised in 38 years. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is currently facing its highest inflation since 1949 when the communist government was established. Prices in June of this year were 19 percent higher than they were in the same period last year. Non-staple food items, such as vegetables, fish and meat have increased the most, some by as much as 60 percent over the past year. Feng acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> report was correct in saying that tigers, lions and other big cats were forced to fast one day a week. But he said that policy has been in effect since 1954. `` Their stomach capacity is very large,'' zoo worker <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaopu </PERSON> told the Guangming Daily. `` They can go without eating for several days.'' Feng also acknowledged that lately the zoo has been substituting cheaper items for more expensive ones to save money. But, he said, `` if the more expensive food is the favorite food of the animal, then we will guarantee that food no matter what the cost.''

 Like her son <PERSON> George </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shies from the intense media scrutiny that would throw her private life open to public examination and dissection. The 87-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a longstanding policy against interviews, and even the vice president's plan to show off his large clan at the Republican National Convention has n't changed her mind. `` She will be here this week. She wo n't be giving interviews,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, a member of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign staff. Nevertheless, insights into the personality of the likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee's mother can be found in recent comments and past articles written by none other than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Every mother has her own style. My mother's was a little like an Army drill sergeant's,'' the vice president wrote in a May 1985 Mother's Day article for the <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> -LRB- Conn. -RRB- Time. `` She had five of us to raise _ Pres -LRB- <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> -RRB-, myself, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bucky </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> William </PERSON> -RRB- _ and she just felt strongly that there was too much for us to learn and to do to waste any time on chaos. So we had very little chaos around our house,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. A widow since the 1972 death of her husband, <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lives in <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, the wealthy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb where son <PERSON> George </PERSON> attended schools as a youngster. In the article, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled the childhood tennis lessons given by his mother. `` I can hear her now: ` You can do it. You'll get it. You'll get it.' And she would be patient and tireless and always absolutely sure we would _ eventually _ get it. `` She also tamed our arrogance. I'll never forget years ago, saying rather innocently, I thought, ` I was off my game.' Mother jumped all over me. ` You are just learning _ you do n't have a game,''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote. Recently, in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> interview, the vice president was asked which of his mother's qualities he tries to emulate. `` Gentleness, caring, sharing,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded. `` She tried to instill in us, through example, not through lecturing, a certain kindness, concern for the other guy _ fairness is a word, I think. `` Competitive, tough ... I mean she could whip anybody in anything,'' he said. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> succeeds in defeating Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be the 12th mother to see her son sworn in as president, the first since January 1977 when <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> witnessed her son <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>'s inauguration. Miss <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> became a celebrity in her own right in the Carter years. That is not expected to happen with <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Hispanics: Knowing Spanish Is Detrimental to FBI Career</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOLDEN LEWIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EL PASO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the surest ways to end up in a dead-end job in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is to be a Spanish-speaking Hispanic, according to agents testifying in a discrimination suit against the agency. `` I think the ability to speak Spanish in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is a tremendous liability,'' Special Agent <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> testified Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>. The 311 agents who have joined the class-action lawsuit contend the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> discriminates against Hispanics in hiring, promotion and discipline. The agents want damages and a change in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> promotion practices. The non-jury trial is expected to last two weeks with up to 100 witnesses expected to testify. Three Hispanic agents who testified Monday described the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as an organization that shunts Spanish speakers into relatively menial tasks as it promotes people who complete investigations and make important arrests. `` What happens as a Spanish-speaking agent is, you might initiate an investigation and have it going pretty well, but you're pulled off,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> testified That usually happens because the Hispanic agents are put on a temporary assignment requiring Spanish, he said. Other agents who complete such investigations begun by Hispanic agents end up getting the credit, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said.

 Radical student leaders said today they will not give up their anti-government struggle, but admitted they failed to gain public support to share the Olympics Games with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Leaders told 1,500 cheering supporters at <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> they will continue pressing for reunification of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. They also said they will have to make a greater effort to gain public support. `` We have to admit the road to unification is still too far and there lie many difficulties ahead. Further struggle is called for,'' said one student leader, Oh Yung-shik. Riot police blocked students who tried to march out of <LOCATION> Yonsei </LOCATION> Monday to go the border truce site of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> for reunifiction talks with North Korean student delegates. Police arrested about 2,000 students Monday who took part in demonstrations in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after breaking up the march with tear gas and beating protesters. Most of the students were released after receiving warnings. The government banned the march and the meeting with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> students as a threat to national security. A similar march June 10 was blocked by police. The students, many of them from colleges around the nation, left the college to return home after riot police surrounding the campus withdrew. Today, new violence broke out at <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police after plainclothes police staged a raid and arrested 10 students. The radical students back <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s demand to co-host the Olympics that begin Sept. 17 in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The International Olympic Committee has rejected the north's demand because the Games are awarded to a single city. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Games if it is not allowed to co-host. The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, have failed to gain public support because of their violent tactics and open advances to the communist north. Just a few thousand students took part in demonstrations in various cities over the past week. Most South Koraens fear the north and believe it wants to conquer the peninsula. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War, which ended three years later without a political solution.

<HEAD>Turning In Child Abusers: More Talk than Action?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most people say they would report suspected child abuse, but when confronted with it, only about a third do so, a survey shows. The poll, published in September's Parents magazine, found that of 1,008 adults questioned in nationwide telephone interviews, 11 percent said they knew someone they suspected of child abuse and 88 percent said they did not. Of those who suspected child abuse, 37 percent said they contacted authorities, 34 percent said they did nothing, 21 percent said they talked to the people involved and 5 percent took `` some other action.'' Of those did nothing, 55 percent explained they were n't sure if they understood the situation well enough to know what was happening. Others said it was none of their business, or they were concerned about legal liability, offending someone, losing a friend or suffering physical injury. Of those who said they did not know any abusive adults, 66 percent said they would contact police if they suspected child abuse, 24 percent would talk to the people involved, 3 percent would take other action and 7 percent were unsure. Asked if someone who witnesses child abuse but does nothing should be held legally responsible, 47 percent of those polled said yes, 38 percent said no and 15 percent were unsure. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A motorist sued <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, demanding that the insurer stop spending policyholders' money on an industry campaign to bring no-fault insurance to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The suit, filed in state court Monday by <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, also asks that the company return to policyholders money already contributed in support of the ballot issue. State Farm spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahly </PERSON> said the contributions, which amounted to $ 1.4 million through June, were a legitimate use of the funds. `` It is our opinion that it is entirely proper for State Farm to participate in elections in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' Stahly said. The insurance industry expects to spend up to $ 43 million promoting the November ballot issue, spokesman have said. At a news conference announcing <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>' suit, his attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shernoff </PERSON>, was accompanied by a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader-affiliated </PERSON> group backing a rival initiative that would cut rates 20 percent.

 Nine people serving free meals to the homeless in Golden Gate Park were arrested on charges of violating state and local law. `` They're in violation of the health code, the park code and the penal code,'' Lt. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON> said Monday. `` We bent over backward to explain the city and state ordinances regarding the issue.'' Police would not comment further on the charges Monday night. Volunteers from Food Not Bombs began distributing the food in spring. Police contend the handouts draw drug and alcohol abusers to the park and that more than a dozen nearby homeowners and business owners complained. Police had repeatedly warned Food Not Bomb that its volunteers would be arrested if they set up a food line in the park. Police had proposed having the group dispense food at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which serves free meals of its own twice a week and has the required sanitary facilities, but the church and Food Not Bombs rejected the idea.

 Beachgoers undeterred by the medical waste washing up here this summer found something much more interesting in the water _ money. Great gobs of cash appeared at <LOCATION> Weekapaug </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> over the weekend, prompting at least 40 people to run, giggling and screeching, into the water to pick it up. `` You had your own little spot and you just stood there and watched the seaweed,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, who found $ 23 Sunday. `` It was in the seaweed. Sometimes it was rolled up and when you went to grab it, it got washed away. If you saw green you just had to jump for it.'' Lifeguard <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Perri </PERSON>, 20, said the scene was `` wild.'' `` People were digging in the sand with sticks and turning over the seaweed,'' he said. `` One girl was yelling, ` Mommy, Mommy, look what I found. She had two $ 100 bills. My boss found 80 bucks.'' Most of the money displayed Monday by the finders appeared in good shape and was dated 1985. The cash began washing ashore Wednesday. Unlike the needles, syringes and other medical debris discovered here, the money was not immediately reported to lifeguards, police or state environmental authorities. Secret Service agent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said that as far as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the agency, is concerned, it's `` finders keepers.

<TEXT>
 An artist wants to give women a break from cat calls heard on city streets by encouraging men to leer, if they must, in silence. Easy-to-read directions will be posted in the financial district and near City Hall. One sign admonishes: `` No Cat Calls,'' specifying `` whistling and kissing sounds,'' and depicts a woman halting a truck driven by a cat. Another sign demands, in English and Spanish: `` Curb Your Animal Instinct.'' It shows a `` wolf'' being restrained with a leash from lunging at a woman. <PERSON> Ilona </PERSON> <PERSON> Granet </PERSON>, who designs logos and signs for businesses and boats, said she will install them herself later this week at her expense with tools and equipment provided by the city. `` Women ca n't walk along the streets in the city without being subjected to sexual innuendoes,'' she said. The signs, the 40-year-old artist said, are for women who ca n't bring themselves to respond on their own. Of the five community boards in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> that Ms. <PERSON> Granet </PERSON> has approached about posting her signs, one granted permission and another expressed interest. Among objections raised by the other boards were that the signs insulted working-class men and omitted references to male victims of whistles and cat calls.

Right-wing Christians, including <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, have declared they would use every possible means to block <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s election. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> torpedoed a Syrian-arranged peace treaty between Moslem and <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> militia leaders in 1985 and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is expected to want someone more to its liking. Spokesmen for the Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia that rules east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and most of the Christian heartland, have said they would block the election of a president imposed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> `` with political pressure and even military pressure.'' <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> holds the Lebanese Forces' commander, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, responsible for slaughtering his elder son <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s wife, the couple's 3-year-old daughter and 30 bodyguards in a raid on the <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> mansion in <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION> in 1978. Only 76 parliament deputies are eligible to vote in the presidential balloting. A 99-member parliament was elected in 1972 for a four-year term, but civil war prevented new parliamentary elections and the body's mandate has been renewed regularly. Twenty-two of the original 99 deputies have died, and <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> vacated his seat when he was elected president in 1982. <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> was elected after his brother, <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON>, was killed in a bombing nine days before he was to be sworn in as president. This time, there are more than two dozen presidential candidates. Parliament speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> set the required quorum for this year's presidential election at 53, two thirds of the 79 deputies who were alive when the parliament's tenure was last extended in 1987. Under the constitution, the president is to be elected by a two-third majority at parliament in the first ballot, and a simple majority of 51 percent of votes cast in the second round. The independent daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> An-Nahar </ORGANIZATION> said 17 anti-Syrian parliament members living in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> would boycott Thursday's session if <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> ran Five Armenian parliament members residing in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> also would be unable to make it to the parliament headquarters on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line to attend the session, the newspaper said. Five deputies living abroad have declared they will not return for the election. Word that <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> would seek a new term with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s blessing leaked last week. The Lebanese Forces command ordered its 6,000-strong militia on `` maximum alert'' and said its leaders were holding talks with <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> on ways to block <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s election.

 Hospital officials said today that three sisters were injured, one critically, by debris from two Israeli F-15 fighters that collided and crashed near a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> farming village, killing both pilots. The American-made jets were on training flights near the Dead Sea when the accident occurred Monday, said the army, which appointed a commission to investigate. Israeli radio stations said the planes clipped each other's wings It was the first known accident <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s air force has had with the advanced, high-flying plane, according to informed sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Witnesses said the crash occurred near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Bani </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naim </LOCATION>, about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> at about 11 a.m. The army delayed publication of the accident for 12 hours. Palestinians in <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>, where 10,000 people live, said wreckage hit a nearby tent belonging to a family of the nomadic Bedouin tribe, and soldiers promptly sealed off the area. `` I heard a loud explosion. We did n't know what was happening,'' <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Manasara </PERSON>, 27, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I saw the planes hit the ground and then explode,'' said a Bedouin who was 100 yards from the crash site and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. `` One helicopter landed to pick up the Israeli victims, while another hovered overhead,'' the witness said. The injured girls were identified as <PERSON> Sahar </PERSON> <PERSON> abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shkahaidem </PERSON>, 5 years old, who was in critical condition with extensive burns, <PERSON> Alia </PERSON>, 17, who was hospitalized in fair condition, and <PERSON> Zaharia </PERSON>, 15, who was treated at <LOCATION> Alia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and released. Twenty sheep belonging to the Shkahaidem family were also killed in the accident, and 30 were hurt, the Bedouin witness said. The army identified the pilots killed as veteran fliers, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON>, 36, of the Kfar Giliadi communal farm on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border with <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and Maj. <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>, 33, of the Merhavia collective farm Their funerals were scheduled for today. The F-15, nicknamed the Eagle by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, is the most advanced, land-based jet fighter in the American inventory. The twin-engine jet is designed to fly and fight in all weather conditions and can soar at more than 2 -LCB- times the speed of sound. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is one of few foreign countries that has been allowed to acquire the single-seat fighter, which has a combat altitude ceiling of 65,000 feet. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has about 50 of the planes, costing about $ 30 million each and manufactured by the <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. It ordered five more earlier in the summer. The fighter has been used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in conducting deadly air raids in the past, among them, dog fights with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> in 1982 in which more than 80 Syrian jets were shot down, while no Israeli F-15s were lost.

 The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive panel has approved the establishment of a provisional government in Israeli-occupied territories, a senior Palestinian official said. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, also called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to support the formation of an independent Palestinian state. `` The Executive Committee has approved the idea of the provisional government and it will be endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> told a news conference Monday in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, parliament-in-exile of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to meet next month in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. A high-level <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> delegation met today in the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The delegation discussed the idea of a provisional government in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Monday with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>, delegation member <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Horani </PERSON> said. At the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> news conference, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> would explore the idea of demanding independence for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, and the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. The territories have been plagued for the last eight months by a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rebellion, or `` intefadah'' in Arabic, that has claimed the lives of more than 240 Palestinians and four Israelis since Dec. 8. `` This -LRB- independent -RRB- state has been the target of the intefadah and the Council will thoroughly examine the possibility of its declaration soon,'' <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. He said `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration should support ... <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions which call for the setting up of a Palestinian state.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has denounced all attempts to declare Palestinian independence or set up a state in occupied territory. It refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terrorist group. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would compensate Palestinians left jobless after <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> late last month announced he was cutting legal and administrative ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Recent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> appeals for a dialogue with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have provoked debate in the Jewish state over the sincerity of the statements. Last month <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> indicated the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> may adopt the idea of peace talks based on recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. On Sunday, <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, deputy chairman of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> wing, made a similar statement in the Paris-based Journal du Dimanche. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, demanded Monday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> present a clear-cut position.

 Soviet troops will not complete their withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> earlier than the Feb. 15 deadline set by a U.N.-sponsored agreement because of the military situation there, a government spokesman said today. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> repeated Kremlin accusations that guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed Afghan government have been supplied with weapons and other aid by <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in violation of the April 14 agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, speaking at a regular news briefing, also denied a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegation that the retreating Soviet forces have left behind as many as 30 million mines. Half of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s more than 100,000 soldiers who had been deployed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> have returned since the withdrawal began May 15. The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement requires the other Soviet soldiers to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> no later than Feb. 15, but Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> has indicated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would like all of its troops home before the end of this year. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported the second phase of the withdrawal would begin in November, and <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> confirmed that the pullout would likely extend beyond 1988. `` The situation in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> does not give grounds to accelerate the withdrawal of Soviet troops,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said rebel groups based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have been increasing their attacks on Soviet-backed Afghan government troops, and that until the guerrillas laid down their arms and joined a proposed governing coalition, there would be no opportunity to complete the Soviet withdrawal early. `` For the time being there is no possibility to reduce the plan for withdrawing Soviet troops,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. The Soviet government has complained repeatedly that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is violating the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords and on Monday threatened to take unspecified action in response. If military supplies to the insurgents continue, the statement said, `` the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> reserves for itself, in that case, the right to take such measures that are necessitated by the situation.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> declined to specify what action the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would take, but said the statement was meant as a `` warning'' to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Monday that it appeared the Soviets were adhering to their withdrawal commitments, but said the soldiers had left behind as many as 30 million mines, including booby-trapped toys. `` We would like to state again that we are not involved in any mining,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, adding that Soviet soldiers have been helping Afghans remove and defuse mines planted by opposition forces along major roads. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was again under rocket fire, and said `` fierce fighting'' continued around <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, a northern provincial capital. Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and Soviet officials have said <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> was lost to guerrillas forces earlier this month but taken back again by government troops. Two Moslem guerrilla groups claimed today in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that their fighters were holding on to <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION> despite heavy bombardment by Afghan government troops. The guerrillas also claimed today that they captured <PERSON> Talogan </PERSON>, capital of <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> province east of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, on Friday. With about 50,000 Soviet troops remaining in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, guerrillas have concentrated recent attacks around <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, northern provinces and the southeastern provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, abandoned by the Soviets the same time as <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. Many Western analysts predict Afghan government troops will not last long against the Moslem insurgents, who are armed via <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979.

<NOTE>EDS: CORRECTS thing to things in second graf.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Our friends on the other side had actually passed the single highest tax bill in the 200-year history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Auto loans, because of their policies, went up to 17 percent _ so our great factories began shutting down. Fuel costs jumped through the atmosphere _ more than doubling. Then people waited in gas lines as well as unemployment lines. Facts are stupid things _ stubborn things, I should say. And then there was the misery index. That was an election year gimmick they designed for the 1976 campaign _ they added the unemployment and inflation rates. And it came to 13.4 percent in 1976, and they declared that our candidate, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, had no right to seek re-election with that kind of misery index. But four years later, in the 1980 campaign, they did n't mention the misery index. Do you suppose it was because it was no longer 13.4 percent? In those four years it had become almost 21 percent. And last month, in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at their convention, there was again no mention of the misery index. Why? Because, right now, it's less than 9.2 percent. Facts are stubborn things. When we met in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in that summer of 1980 _ it was a summer of discontent for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> around the world. Our national defense had been so weakened, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had begun to engage in reckless aggression, including the invasion and occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to that was to forbid our athletes to participate in the 1980 Olympics and to try to pull the rug out from under our farmers with a grain and soybean embargo. And in those years, on any given day, we had military aircraft that could n't fly for lack of spare parts, and ships that could n't leave port for the same reason or for lack of a crew Our embassy in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was burned to the ground, and the one in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was stormed and occupied with all Americans taken as hostages. The world began to question the constancy and resolve of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Our leaders answered, not that there was something wrong with our government, but that our people were at fault because of some malaise. Well, facts are stubborn things. When our friends last month talked of unemployment, despair, hopelessness, economic weakness _ I wondered why on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> they were talking about 1978 instead of 1988. Now, now we hear talk that it's time for a change. Well, ladies and gentlemen, another friendly reminder: We are the change. We rolled up our sleeves and went to work in January of 1981; we focused on hope, not despair. We challenged the failed policies of the past, because we believed that a society is great, not because of promises made by its government, but only because of progress made by its people. And that was our change. We said something shocking. Taxes ought to be reduced, not raised. We cut the tax rates for the working folks of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. We indexed taxes, and that stopped bracket creep which kicked average wage-earners into higher tax brackets when they'd only received a cost-of-living pay raise. And we initiated reform of the unfairness in our tax system. And what do you know _ the top 5 percent of earners are paying a higher percentage of the total tax revenue at the lower rates than they ever had before, and millions of earners at the bottom of the scale have been freed from paying any income tax at all.

<HEAD>First Stage of Nationwide AIDS Survey Scrapped After Community

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal authorities have scrapped the first stage of a major AIDS survey because of protests from community leaders in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said Monday the project was opposed because of fear that participants' AIDS test results would not be kept confidential. Since the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> project _ the first part of a major study to assess the nation's AIDS infection rate _ was bungled in its early stages, the agency must drop <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as its survey site and start over elsewhere, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. `` The damage has been done. If I had the same information as the black people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, I would have been concerned'' about participating in the survey, he said. Black health leaders described the setback, which comes more than a year after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called for the study, as an example of the administration's awkward approach to issues in the black community. `` It is emblematic of a lack of sensitivity,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, chairman of pediatrics at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. At issue were the questions doctors planned to ask as they took blood samples at 800 randomly selected households in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The questions included the subject's name and sexual preference. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the study would be redesigned with queries concerning only age, gender and general geographic location. More local people should have been involved in planning the survey, said Dr. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON>, commissioner of health for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. He said that would have allowed concerns about confidentiality to be addressed. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> planned to use the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> project as a trial run in a nationwide AIDS survey of about 50,000 people. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is the only other site beside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that had been publicized for the survey. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said Monday a new site had not been selected. At a conference on AIDS last year in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, black and Hispanic leaders read resolutions lamenting <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` disregard and insensitivity'' toward their groups.

<TEXT>
 A bus driver said his brakes failed on a steep road and he tried to stop the careening vehicle against a tunnel wall, but the bus crashed, killing 12 children and three adults, the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The crash Monday outside <LOCATION> Eidsfjord </LOCATION>, 120 miles west of <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, was the worst bus accident in <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> since 1948. Among the 15 fatalities, 12 were children from a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> school on a week-long outing to the British <LOCATION> Shetland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. All 19 of the other passengers were injured, police said. They said the Swedish bus was carrying 23 students, nine parents, a teacher and the driver. <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Berntsen </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, was driving behind the bus and was the first at the scene, according to the <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Dagbladet </ORGANIZATION>. `` I talked to the injured driver. He said the brakes had failed and that he tried to stop the bus by letting it swerve along the tunnel walls,'' <PERSON> Berntsen </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` He told me that he had urged the passengers to stay in the rear of the bus. That may have saved the lives of several of them,'' he said. The bus rammed into a concrete wall near the end of the steep, curving <LOCATION> Maaboedal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tunnel </LOCATION>, about 60 miles from the city of <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>, where the group was to board a ferry, according to the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION>. Survivors were evacuated by helicopter and six people were reported severely injured but out of danger, according to a doctor at <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Haukeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bernt </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>, chief constable in the <LOCATION> Hardanger </LOCATION> district where the crash occurred, said a crane was used to lift some of the bodies from the wreckage. The 11 - and 12-year-olds who died were from the <ORGANIZATION> Kvarnbacka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Kista </LOCATION> A teacher at the school told <ORGANIZATION> Aftonbladet </ORGANIZATION> the students had spent two years holding bazaars and saving money to finance the trip. The tunnel, which has had no fatal accidents since it opened in 1986, is about 120 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>. Swedish Radio said the bus was not licensed for commerical traffic and was rented or borrowed from a sports club. The driver was a police officer licensed to drive a bus, according to the Aftonbladet daily in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s worst bus accident occurred on July 5, 1948, when 16 people were killed on a remote northern road.

 A blind woman accepted a $ 17,000 settlement in a suit accusing a policeman of forcing her to clean up her guide dog's mess as bystanders watched. <PERSON> Raygena </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, a stockbroker at <ORGANIZATION> Paine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Webber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, admitted that she had allowed her dog to defecate in a gutter in 1985 but said she believed blind people were exempt from the city's `` pooper-scooper'' ordinance. A police officer ordered <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> to clean up the mess, and <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> became `` increasingly distressed and humiliated as a large crowd gathered,'' the suit said. The lawsuit added that Officer <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> forced her `` to clean up after her dog with a paper tissue, insert the waste into a paper bag and travel across the street to deposit the bag in a garbage receptacle.'' In court papers, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> never told him she was blind. The officer was temporarily suspended and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> has been legally blind since birth.

 Israeli troops shot and seriously wounded three Palestinians today and 75 were treated for beating injuries, hospital officials said. The army said at least 12 Palestinians were injured in scuffles with troops in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where a curfew was in effect for a second day. Officials at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said troops beat Arabs with riot sticks on the head, arms and legs, and put the number of injured at 75. Thirty-five were still undergoing treatment by midday Tuesday, they said. Officials at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, meanwhile, said <PERSON> Aymen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yameen </PERSON>, 16, suffered a critical gunshot wound to the head. They said a second youth, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Razak </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudhud </PERSON>, 20, was critically wounded in the stomach during a clash between stone-throwers and soldiers inside <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army confirmed troops wounded a Palestinian in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> during a clash with Arabs throwing stones and bottles. It said it was checking the reports of two wounded in nearby <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and of beating injuries in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Israeli news reports said soldiers beefed up patrols in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where the 650,000 residents have been confined to their homes since a curfew was imposed Sunday night following a firebomb attack on Israeli civilians in which an 8-month-old was seriously burned. The curfew has denied reporters entry to <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> except under military escort, although Jewish settlers were allowed into the Israeli-occupied seaside strip and armed supporters of Rabbi <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahane </PERSON> launched patrols on a highway leading to Jewish settlements in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> food trucks also were barred from entering <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to distribute daily rations of flour, rice, milk, sugar and oil to refugee camps, said <PERSON> Rulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Uye </PERSON>, a spokesman for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. But there were no reported food shortages, <PERSON> Uye </PERSON> said. Dozens of Palestinian youths defied the curfew Monday by hurling stones and burning tires on roads and darting out from behind street corners to shout `` We want a state,'' witnesses said. Demonstrators also burned tires in <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON>, while in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> children broke curfew today by playing basketball and soccer in the streets and fleeing when soldiers were spotted, an Arab witness said. Clashes erupted in several areas, including <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in northern <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, where soldiers fired tear gas to disperse stone-throwing demonstrators, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. A 15-year-old Palestinian was also moderately wounded in the stomach in the <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> clash, said an official at the city's <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> John </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. The military also said soldiers had recently begun using a new plastic bullet which is designed to cause fewer casualties. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the new bullet was potentially lethal at a range of under 70 yards. The radio also reported that unidentified assailants sabotaged a water pipeline to the <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hagai </LOCATION> settlement near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> Monday night. Police said, meanwhile, they were investigating an apparent suicide by a 20-year-old Palestinian detainee who was found hanging in his jail cell at the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police headquarters today. The detainee, <PERSON> Nabeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON>, of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, was detained Aug. 10 on suspicion of involvement in anti-Israeli violence, said <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, who declined to elaborate. The <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> has been under an around-the-clock and indefinite curfew since Sunday after a violent weekend in which three <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> died during protests in the lands <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. It was only the third time the army sealed off the entire <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the Palestinian uprising began last Dec. 8. Palestinians and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials traced the weekend's outbreak of violence to the arson deaths of three <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> workers who were trapped in a shed set on fire near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> last week. Police said Jewish extremists may have been involved. The third worker, a 34-year-old man, died early today of his wounds, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio reported. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> curfew a clear message that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was cracking down on protesters, and said it would be in effect `` as long as needed.'' Some Israeli sources speculated the move, which kept some 50,000 Gazans away from jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was an effort to put economic pressure on the residents. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said 21-year-old <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION> refugee camp was dead on arrival Monday after being shot in the heart during clashes. His death raised to 245 the Arab death toll in the uprising. Four Israelis also have died.

 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who has made no secret of his desire to be the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, said today that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to delay naming his running mate is smart because it has kept suspense alive. `` I do n't think it's demeaning,'' the congressman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to keep secret the name of his running mate until the last minute. `` It's kept suspense in our convention; it's certainly going to focus a lot of attention not only on his pick, but on his own speech, and to that extent, it's been a good idea,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he did n't think the suspense should be drawn out until Thursday night when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate is to be announced at the Republican National Convention. He speculated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had either made up his mind or was close to doing so. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told reporters on Monday that he was eager to be selected. `` If I were to be asked, I would be a terrific campaigner, and a terrific candidate, and a terrific vice president,'' he said. `` But I came here not expecting it. I do n't expect it today. I'm not sitting by the telephone. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, addressing Republican delegates on the convention's opening night Monday, pledged to continue the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> revolution `` We're going to finish the job,'' he said. `` We're going to finish what we began in 1980: To help all Americans ... share in the success of freedom, and democracy, and peace.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, whose own presidential campaign fizzled in the early primaries, spoke to the convention before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell to his party It was the high point in a schedule that seemed aimed at keeping <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> in the public eye _ and in the speculation _ as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pondered a running mate. `` Could I be a good vice president? You bet,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told reporters before his speech. `` I was a good second string quarterback, and I could be a good second string quarterback for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who played for the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chargers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bills </ORGANIZATION> before entering politics. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was attending delegation meetings, minority receptions and other public events, as well as conducting network television interviews, during the convention week. A small staff from his congressional office and volunteers from his defunct campaign kept a presence for him at a convention hotel. As he addressed the convention, delegates waved red signs bearing his name. But his speech hardly seemed to grip his convention hall audience, and he did not provoke a prolonged floor demonstration. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> contends he is not campaigning for the vice presidential job. But his loyal supporters among the party's right wing clearly have been campaigning for him. They chanted `` Bush-Kemp'' at a huge reception he threw Sunday night, and they presented him with a football jersey bearing not his playing number _ which was 15 _ but 2, the number representing the second spot on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket. And <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> says he has arranged for one member of each of the 50 state delegations at the convention to gather signatures on petitions asking that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> be chosen as running mate. `` We're not trying to take <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision away from him,'' <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> said. `` Only he can make that decision. We're just trying to show him what we think of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, addressing the convention that he had hoped would be nominating him, spoke of economic opportunity _ his usual theme _ but largely avoided the arcane economic terminology and the laments for the abandoned gold standard that so frequently filled his campaign speeches. He praised the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> record and urged the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to reach out to blacks, Hispanics and other minorities _ reflecting his frequent call for blending social progress and economic opportunity with bedrock conservatism. `` As the party of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> _ and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ we believe that freedom and hope and opportunity ca n't be for just some of us,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` They've got to be for all of us. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has got to keep moving ahead, and we ca n't leave anyone behind.'' He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s support for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the Star Wars nuclear defense system, has `` shown us how we can make even the threat of nuclear war obsolete.'' And he credited <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with leading `` an entrepreneurial renaissance'' that has `` electrified the world and raised our standard of living'' while creating 17 million new jobs in five years.

<TEXT>
 More than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in the southern city of <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION> went on strike today to demand legalization of Solidarity and higher wages, a spokeswoman said. The strike in <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>, about 275 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed trade federation. Solidarity spokeswoman <PERSON> Katarzyna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketrzynska </PERSON> said workers on the overnight shift at the Manifest Lipcowy mine stayed outside the mine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for the morning shift. She said security officers blocked miners on the afternoon shift, which starts at 2 p.m., from entering the grounds to join the striking miners. The strike began at noon today, according to <LOCATION> Katrzynska </LOCATION>. She said the miners are demanding the legalization of Solidarity and reinstatement of workers fired for union activities. The workers are also calling for higher wages and better working conditions, and are requesting two lawyers and two economists to assist them in the negotiations. Manifest Lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION> to experience unrest. Workers at the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> copper mine near the city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> staged a protest rally Monday to demand improved safety conditions and the return of Solidarity activists to work. Three members of Solidarity were barred Saturday from working. Solidarity was crushed in 1981, when the government imposed martial law, and was banned nearly a year later by parliament. On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around the northern port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, the first and only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.

 Black Republicans in the year of Democrat <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> are a minority within a minority, but they do n't seem to mind swimming against the tide. `` We're strong swimmers,'' said one. At the same time, black delegates to the Republican National Convention, who account for only 3 percent of the total, generally had no quarrel with former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential contender <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s suggestion that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> jump ship and join the Republicans. `` I feel pride as a black American'' in what <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has accomplished, said <PERSON> Gertie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 65, an administrator from <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` I just wish he was a Republican.'' Nevertheless, the third-generation <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> added, ` It's fantastic to be a Republican in any year, this year included If you look at the statistics, you will see that we're swimming against the tide. But we're strong swimmers, with strong legs and strong backs and strong arms.'' In a speech to the delegates, du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as `` a prominent voice. But as long as you speak as a Democrat,'' he added, `` you will never be a successful leader.'' His suggestion that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> join `` the party of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'' was greeted by silence from the Republicans. <PERSON> Minton </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, 66, who heads an accreditation task force for <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> `` hit it right on the head. Where <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> belongs is in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` Most of us look at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as taking the black vote for granted. They promise blacks everything, but what they deliver falls far short. Most current black millionaires were made during <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s administration,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said. `` Under <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, nothing was passed out but welfare.'' He, too, is proud of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, but calls himself resolutely Republican. `` In a party that appears predominantly white, there is opportunity for those who can ride the tide and take with them some who can not help themselves.'' <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, 65, a teacher from <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, said she was confident <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s example will lead to `` an emergence of black leadership'' within the GOP. `` I respect <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. I think he's a national leader, but I'm a Republican and I believe in the Republican philosophy.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a court administrator from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> `` put things on the map. He had a movement. He did stir the contents. I'd love to see someone stir up this convention. It's stuffy. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> was n't sure the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> needed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> who? Where's his experience? _ but he did think the party could learn from the Democrats. `` There's lots of lip service being paid to us, but not much else,'' he said during du <PERSON> Pont </PERSON>'s speech. `` -LRB- Republicans -RRB- could stand to look over at the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and see what they're doing to lure blacks, Hispanics and Jews We need them all.'' The dearth of blacks at the convention was evident in the instructions given to delegate <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a black delegate who was told to leave the funny hats at home and look dignified. `` As one of the few blacks on the floor,'' she said, `` I could be on camera at any time.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, the convicted rapist whose accuser later recanted, was freed from prison today after a six-month term for violating terms of his parole and entered an alcohol rehabilitation program. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, 30, served his term at <ORGANIZATION> Logan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He was sent to prison after being arrested in a bar Dec. 24 for allegedly starting a fight over a sandwich. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, who blamed a drinking problem for his repeated scrapes with the law since his 1985 release from prison on the rape conviction, was taken to a rehabilitation program at an undisclosed location in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said. `` He'll be in the residential portion for several weeks and then he'll be involved with that organization on an outpatient basis for a while longer,'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said today. <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> three years ago was paroled early from a 25 - to 50-year sentence after <PERSON> Cathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> recanted testimony that he had raped her Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> commuted <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s sentence to the six years he had served. Mrs. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said in her recantation that she made up the rape story to cover up for a sexual liaison with her boyfriend. In commuting <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s sentence, however, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> bypassed <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s request for a grant of clemency, saying he did not believe <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s recantation. On Monday, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON>, said he had asked <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> for clemency because of new evidence. <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> said tests by a forensic serologist on genetic material from blood and semen samples from <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> and her former boyfriend prove `` conclusively, absolutely and definitively'' that <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> did not have sex with <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who received results of the test last week, is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> for the Republican National Convention. `` He wants to talk to some scientific types, to feel comfortable in his own mind whether this test is scientifically reliable beyond a reasonable doubt,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnich </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s legal counsel. The clemency request is submitted to a prison review board, which makes a recommendation to the governor. Since his 1985 release, <PERSON> Dotson </PERSON> has been convicted of drunken driving and arrested another time on charges he punched his wife and threatened the couple's infant daughter.

 Authorities in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> today released 51 people who were arrested during last week's anti-government demonstrations in the capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said. Student groups meanwhile distributed leaflets in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> calling for street demonstrations Wednesday to demand an end to 26 years of authoritarian rule, diplomats and journalists said. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said of those detained on Aug. 8-9, 51 were freed from Insein Prison and handed over to parents and guardians. The broadcast, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said 47 of those released were students. It did not identify those freed. Because of the dates given, it was doubtful that among those released were <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s leading dissident, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, and the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, Sein Win. The two were among 10 people detained July 29-30. The radio also said 30 people arrested in Aug. 4-10 disturbances in <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>, were freed Sunday. The releases were the first reported since the demonstrations ended last Friday with the resignation of President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> had said early on Aug. 9 that authorities had arrested more than 700 demonstrators overnight. Later that day, it reported 1,451 arrests in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> but did n't make clear if that included the 700 figure. A large number of other dissidents were arrested before and after Aug. 8-9. Students distributed leaflets calling for protests and attached identical posters on trees, mailboxes and walls of major buildings today. The buildings include <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which became a rallying point for protesters after security forces allegedly shot doctors and nurses there during the riots. Soldiers made no attempt to take down the posters, said <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ting </PERSON>, a journalist for <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> daily, upon returning to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> today. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency meanwhile reported 177 <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> lawyers signed a document charging last week's shooting of demonstrators violated <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s Constitution and the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> declaration of human rights. The agency said the nation's bar association submitted the document Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, or the president's office. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said the council sent copies of the document to foreign embassies and to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary general. A Western diplomat reached in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said army trucks and tanks with up to 200 soldiers parked today about 200 yards from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, just south of the <LOCATION> Sule </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pagoda </LOCATION>. Witnesses said last week's violence began when security forces opened fire to disperse tens of thousands of protesters who had converged peacefully in front of the ancient pagoda The diplomat said the vehicles were gone by the afternoon, and the presence of security forces elsewhere in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> was light. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s sole political party, the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and the legislature are holding emergency sessions Friday, presumably to choose a successor to <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a retired general who was widely hated for crushing dissent during a quarter-century of military-dominated rule. Most analysts said they doubted the new <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> leadership would make dramatic changes in the one-party system Ne Win instituted 26 years ago. <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> ruled as president and party chairman for 17 days after Ne Win's resignation last month. Diplomats and tourists arriving today in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> said the placards and leaflets had seven demands, including multi-party democracy, legalization of student unions, a court trial for <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> and the release of political dissidents including their leading figure, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>. The students also have called for major changes in leadership, reductions in the cost of living and compensation for families of people killed or wounded in the demonstrations. It was not clear if these were included in the list of seven demands. State-run Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> has said at least 95 people were killed and 240 wounded in protests in two dozen towns last week, but Western diplomats believe hundreds were killed as security forces repeatedly fired into crowds.

 Football coaches cut back on training, utilities from <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> cut back on power, and the homeless sought shelter in air-conditioned buildings as record high temperatures were set in 26 cities. Grain and soybean futures posted their strongest gains in a week Monday in response to predictions that crops in the drought-weary Corn Belt would bake for most of this week. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Monday's record 97 degrees caused <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> to impose a brownout on at least 250,000 tenants, leaving them without air conditioning and no way out but the stairs _ elevators to their high-rise homes were shut down. At least 10,000 other tenants suffered a blackout, scores of businesses without power had to close and two hospitals voluntarily switched to backup power. Monday's record high temperatures for the date included 104 degrees in <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, breaking a 102-year-old mark by two degrees; 97 in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, respectively breaking 114-year-old and 93-year-old records by a degree. All 48 contiguous states had temperatures of 87 degrees or higher and 100-degree temperatures were registered in 22 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the National Weather Serivce said. Today's forecast called for much of the same, with temperatures above normal from central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and west through the Plains. Highs were to reach the 60s and 70s over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and along the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast today. Readings in the 80s were expected over the upper <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>. Highs were to reach between 100 and 105 over the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, the middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, southern portions of the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. The Desert Southwest could watch for highs to climb near 115, and the rest of the nation was to be in the 90s. In <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, where the nation's record high temperature was a staggering 114 degrees Monday, a big concern was for livestock. With the heat expected to continue today, the weather service's livestock safety index was predicted to reach the emergency category across most of the state through this evening In <LOCATION> Minnehaha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, people who needed to find relief from the heat could call a hot-line number to get a ride to a shelter. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where air-conditioners have been sold out across the state for a month, ice skating spelled relief. Concord's Recreation and <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is giving residents a chance to get back into the cold tonight by offering free ice skating The <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, which runs an overnight shelter for the homeless, said they have started to allow people to stay during daytime hours because of the heat. `` We've had an increase in the number of people we're serving this summer,'' Cadet <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` Normally summer is our slow time but we've been pretty busy.'' At least 10 elderly residents with heat-related complaints had to be carried down from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> high-rises by police and paramedics, but most of the tenants seemed to have concerns for food spoiling in rapidly defrosting refrigerators. One woman in a posh East-Side building said she'd hiked up and down 23 flights of stairs twice. The woman, novelist <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Szold </PERSON>, said her leg muscles were sore, but her main concern was for her appliances. Her microwave, her personal computer and her answering machine were all kaput, she said. <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauri </PERSON> of the Mata Hauri Pet Salon in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, said the heat has her pet hair-clipping business up about 40 percent. `` The dogs are really suffering,'' particularly black ones, she said, because black absorbs the heat. The heat also is contributing to a twofold increase in the number of neck fractures from diving accidents, physicians at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said. Doctors said Monday they have treated 17 people so far this summer for cervical spinal injuries from diving accidents. They said they treated only eight people for similar injuries last summer. Twenty-six people in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, have died from heat-related causes this month, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a spokesman for the medical examiner's office. Other states reporting heat-related deaths this summer include <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> with 28, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> with 14, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> with five each and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with four. <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s football coach <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Walden </PERSON> said he planned to take special precautions at practices this week. At Cyclone Stadium in <LOCATION> Ames </LOCATION> the temperature on the stadium's artificial surface soared to 130 degrees Monday Raising thermostats, lowering lighting and other voluntary conservation measures Monday meant <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> utilities did not have to impose rotating blackouts, which they had predicted might be necessary to save power. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheperdson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pool </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>'s electricity usage, said power demand appeared to be somewhat below the record set Thursday. But in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, excessive demands for electricity brought on by another day of record-setting temperatures prompted some reductions in service for business customers in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and three other states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> official said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived today in a convention city ready to hand him the Republican presidential nomination, saying he has finally settled on a still-secret running mate and declaring `` this is a big time in our lives.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he practiced his acceptance speech on the plane while en route to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I checked it out with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. She stayed awake for the whole thing,'' he joked. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he called President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last night after his farewell address. `` The president's speech was superb. He gave me a marvelous send-off,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called his appearance with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the airport a symbolic `` passing of the torch.'' Asked when he made up his mind on a veep, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Just before I climbed onto this plane. Today, with finality.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not be specific on when he would announce his running mate, saying only it would be `` before Thursday night.'' `` I want an opportunity to properly notify the person I will nominate,' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II as he flew from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The Republican presidential nominee-to-be said he also wanted to notify those whom he did not choose before making his choice public. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his decision came late. `` I had hoped to do it by the time I got on this airplane and I have,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The decision will be announced before Thursday night.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> warned reporters that he would not let out the name. He said he would `` not to play the game of 20 questions'' with reporters or others about the choice. `` He knows that if he tells one person, it will leak,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. He said he had told no one of his decision _ even his wife or campaign chairman-to-be <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, both of whom joined him for the plane ride. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought he had made his selection `` with a certain dignity ... there is going to be public speculation but I have not contributed to public speculation.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was not offended by remarks on Monday by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> who complained about the selection process. `` I took no offense at that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Early today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and family members boarded <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where he will accept the unchallenged nomination of his party on Wednesday. On Thursday he will give an acceptance that will be measured against the well-received speech <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a month ago in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. After watching the president's Monday night address to the convention, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would `` do my level best to fill those big shoes of President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> forces arranged for an elaborate arrival in this convention city and a carefully orchestrated encounter with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, eager not to steal the show from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, departs immediately for a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation. Upon arrival at the airfield, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to travel by motorcade to the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where he will cross on a riverboat, the <ORGANIZATION> S.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natchez </ORGANIZATION>, arriving with great fanfare on the downtown side of the river for a rally in Spanish Plaza. The water crossing was designed `` to make good use of assets that are part of the local scene,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>. `` It will be a colorful arrival, possibly to be seen on the evening news.'' The vice president has said he hoped to make up his mind on a choice of a running mate before leaving for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, but as of late Monday had not made a decision, although he had considerably narrowed his field of choices, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. Asked whether the delay would cause logistical problems for the campaign staff, Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said: `` I hope that all those under consideration have been smart enough to get their background together, and smart enough to have a -LRB- copier -RRB- machine around, or we'll be putting out pretty sparse information.'' She said that she anticipated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would choose from among the candidates who previously had been asked to provide background and financial information, and doubted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice would come out of the blue. Those believed to be on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s short list include Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and his wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who insists he's not in the running. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held both morning and afternoon sessions on Monday with speechwriter <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> going over a final draft of the acceptance speech. On Monday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be a hard act to follow, and said that he would `` not try to be a <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. There is only one. I want to be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Asked whether he expected to be compared with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he felt such comparisons were inevitable `` because he's been a great president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also told NBC that the `` pressure is mounting'' as he nears the time for him to accept his party's presidential nomination. But, he suggested that as `` an athlete'' he had been `` in pressure situations before, maybe none this intense. But, look, all I'll do is just stand up there and say what I believe about peace and what I believe in about prosperity.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he decided today on a running mate for the fall campaign, but warned he would not `` play the game of 20 questions'' to fuel speculation about whom he had chosen in advance of an announcement later this week. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> here on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Two </ORGANIZATION>, the incumbent vice president said the long process of selection was over. `` I had hoped to do it by the time I got on this airplane and I have,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters aboard the plane. `` The decision will be announced before Thursday night.'' He said the final phase in the process came `` just before I climbed onto this plane. Today, with finality.'' `` I want an opportunity to properly notify the person I will nominate,' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brushed aside complaints about his selection process. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, who has been at the top of many lists, complained about the drawn-out process. `` I do n't care for it, frankly,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. `` I took no offense at that,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded today. Another prospect, Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, said today he did n't think the procedures were demeaning. `` It's kept suspense in our convention,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. `` I imagine <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is either close to or has made up his mind and that is going to keep the suspense alive.'' The rumormongers were having a field day guessing, but no one in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> could say they knew whom <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would tap this week. `` We did n't need rumor control,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. `` It is more like curiosity control.'' The names on the rumor mill: <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>; <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>; his wife <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>; Sens. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>; Atty. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. New names introduced by no one in particular were Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` I am not running around trying to get it,'' said <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>. `` But frankly, if it will help keep the momentum of the past few years going ... I guess it is fair to say I'd do about anything.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> began to have second thoughts. `` From a personal standpoint, if I had a time in my life to be vice president, I would n't choose this time,'' he said. `` If <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thinks I can offer the most to the ticket ... <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will sign up immediately.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator, continued to deny he is under consideration: `` My name's not on that list. ... I've made it perfectly clear, I've no desire to be vice president.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a well-orchestrated telephone call to campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> on the convention floor, did raise the possibility he will unveil his choice a day ahead of schedule on Wednesday. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to `` just leave it on Thursday ... but flexible.'' For one hopeful, the selection procedure has already dragged on too long. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he thought it might have been more valuable for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to choose a running mate last month and not give Democratic nominees <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> a head start for the fall campaign. Aides to the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator rushed to say he was not criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But the vice president had already heard of the comments from the politician known for a sharp tongue. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said he suspects <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has already made up his mind.'' `` If you asked the question, I think that's not an unlikely thing for him to say,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deputy campaign manager <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> on the convention floor. In the Superdome, the hopefuls began their parade to the podium with the opening of the convention Monday. First up were <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the choice of hard-line conservatives, and former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. Later in the week, Sens. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> will address the delegates. Others named on various versions of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list _ <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thornburgh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> _ were here Monday, but not to speak to the convention. Sen. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, who has asked off <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s list, also appeared at the podium and became the first speaker to answer the Democratic question of `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' `` The question is ` Who's <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>?','' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, summing up the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> into a campaign button slogan. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, boosted by the most organized effort promoting a vice presidential candidacy, resolutely declared he wants to be on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> national ticket as he heaped praise on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> had told supporters: `` I was a good second-string quarterback, and I can be a good second-string quarterback for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the remaining female on the list, used her convention speech to talk directly to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women, who currently hold negative views of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Our strong economy has also provided needed jobs for millions of women,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member said, `` And let me say to the women of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: I respect the fact that some of you have questions. I also ask you to have an open mind.'' The other hopefuls varied in their attitudes toward a possible national campaign. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, in town to hear President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Monday speech, remained coy when he asked about how he would respond to an offer from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I have no reason to think that's going to happen,'' he said.

 A maintenance man and his clerical-worker wife today claimed a record $ 26 million lottery jackpot with a ticket they said they kept on the family Bible. `` So I'd advise everybody to say your prayers. You do n't win it just on picking the numbers,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> of <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON>, who with his wife, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, collected the biggest jackpot since the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery began in January. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lotto </LOCATION> jackpot will pay the couple about $ 940,000 a year, after taxes, for the next 20 years. They said the winning ticket was one of 40 they bought for Aug. 6 drawing and stacked on the Bible. <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> said the winning ticket was the last one the couple checked after the drawing, and it rested directly on the Bible. The couple, who declined to give their ages, described themselves as `` working people.'' <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> is a building maintenance man for a bus company. His wife is a clerk with the <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> tax collector. The couple, who have three grown children, said they plan to retire and travel. They said they waited more than a week to come forward in order to take care of home-security matters, talk to their accountant and make out a will. Mrs. <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> said the winning ticket was among 20 she bought for that week. Her husband of 11 years also bought 20, and said the winning numbers were picked at random. Their accountant, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>, said on Monday that he was flying to <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> with the winners but refused to identify them in advance. `` They are a quiet, conservative couple and just wanted to make sure everything was set before they claimed the money,'' <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. The couple have lived in the <LOCATION> Brandon </LOCATION> area for 15 years. `` They really love where they live and are hoping that they do n't have to move because of all this,'' <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON> said.

In a telegram to committee President <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sun </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said his country `` could never accept'' the proposal because separate teams for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in the Olympics `` would give the world -LRB- a -RRB- more strong impression of ` two Koreas' against the desire of our nation for reunification.'' The English text of the telegram was carried by the communist country's official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON> proposed last week that <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> teams march side by side in the opening and closing ceremonies next month in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, each carrying its own flag preceded by a single Olympic flag. <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON> said in messages to the Olympic committees of both countries that this would be a `` highly symbolic event'' demonstrating a `` strong desire for dialogue and reconciliation.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> welcomed the proposal, but <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Games unless it is made a co-host on the grounds that separate teams in a South Korean Olympics would perpetuate the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION> has rejected formal co-host status for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, saying the Olympiad is awarded only to one city, but it has offered to let the country hold five events in the Olympics. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> recently proposed the two nations' parliaments meet to discuss the Sept. 17-Oct. 2 Olympics and a mutual non-aggression pact between the two sides, divided since 1945 `` If good results are produced at the North-South joint parliamentary meeting, we will inform you immediately for your cooperation,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> told <PERSON> Samaranch </PERSON>. No date has been set for the proposed joint parliamentary talks, and South Korean lawmakers have said preparatory talks should be held first to decide on an agenda and other matters. In addition to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, five other countries have not yet responded to invitations from the <ORGANIZATION> IOC </ORGANIZATION> to participate in this year's Olympics: <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION>

<HEAD>FAA Management of Restricted Airspace Faulted</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is doing a poor job of managing restricted airspace used by military planes and helicopters and has no way of judging if the Pentagon has too much `` special-use airspace,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is not effectively managing special-use airspace to ensure its efficient and appropriate use,'' the congressional watchdog agency says in a 43-page report. `` We acknowledge that some improvement in the administration of special-use airspace has recently occurred, but believe that serious and longstanding problems continue to affect the program.'' The study, conducted over an 18-month period and released on Monday, was requested by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, R-N. The agency cited <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' state of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as two areas where the conflict between military and civilian use of the skies is becoming particularly sharp. According to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, `` special use airspace consisted of 556,152 square miles, or about one-fifth, of the airspace within the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' as of September 1987. The agency said that total excludes special-use areas off the coastlines, but still represents a 22 percent increase in square mileage compared to 1978, when 455,000 square miles were designated special use. There are various categories of special use airspace, the agency continued, ranging from a few `` prohibited areas'' that are off-limits to all aircraft to `` restricted areas'' from which civilian aircraft are barred, to `` alert areas,'' in which civilian pilots are simply informed there is a high level of flight activity occurring. The biggest problem with the current system is the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> does not require the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> to disclose in some standardized way how frequently they use the airspace set aside for them, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> does not have adequate utilization data for areas in which hazardous flight training activities occur and requires no data to be provided for other special use airspace areas,'' the report says. That failure is particularly important given the results of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> study conducted last year, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> continued. That study focused on 191 special-use areas and found that during a two-month period, they were utilized by military aircraft only about a quarter of the available hours. `` Seven restricted and three military operations areas were not utilized at all during the period,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. That <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> study also `` revealed that -LRB- restricted -RRB- airspace was sometimes used for other than its intended purpose;'' for example, for `` non-hazardous activities'' such as basic flight training. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is to effectively manage special-use airspace, it needs to know where, when and how airspace is being utilized,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> concluded. Making matters worse, `` even if the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had the data necessary ... it has not established guidance for its -LRB- regional offices -RRB- to reduce or eliminate special-use airspace that is inefficiently or inappropriately used,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> asserted. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, in a written response to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> dated June 13, generally concurred with the findings and said it would begin trying to collect `` actual usage reporting data.'' The agency said it also would `` take appropriate action to periodically review the usage reports and ensure that the airspace is being used for the designated purpose.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, in a separate response, said it is pursuing development of a computerized airspace management system that automatically would provide the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> with the information it needed. Assistant <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> cautioned, however, that low levels of usage do n't always mean that airspace restrictions can be dropped. `` The military has requirements for special-use airspace that may be used as little as three or four times a year,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> wrote. Only the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he added, `` can accurately and properly assess its needs in support of national security.''

 A time bomb exploded in a crowd of commuters in the eastern port town of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> on Tuesday, killing seven people and injuring 20, the military said. Tamil rebels were suspected of planting the bomb, and two were killed in a reprisal attack. All those killed by the bomb were Sinhalese. Six were believed to be government employees going to work, and the seventh was an off-duty Sinhalese soldier, according to officials at <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>'s military command who spoke on the condition they not be identified The explosion occurred at the busy Clock Tower area of the city where many government employees disembark from buses, the officials said. Most of the government employees reporting for work in the city belong to the Sinhalese community. Tamils refused to work for the government after a Sinhalese mob killed three members of their community in the town on July 21. Last week, authorities ordered all employees to report to work and promised them maximum protection, but the rebels challenged the order and warned government staff against complying. The police in <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>, about 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, imposed an unofficial curfew in the town area after the incidents. The bodies of two Tamils with gunshot wounds were found near the Clock Tower. Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people but are in a majority in the island's north and east. Tamil radicals have been agitating for an independent homeland since 1983, claiming discrimination by the Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population.

 A small defense contractor will not fight a court order allowing <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to seize more than $ 1.17 million worth of military components, an attorney said today. <ORGANIZATION> Armtec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had closed earlier this month, laying off about 80 employees, after <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> withheld a payment, claiming it had been overbilled. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> then sued <PERSON> Armtec </PERSON>, charging that the smaller firm might move or damage components manufactured under contract with <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> issued an order Monday allowing <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> to seize the items. <PERSON> Armtec </PERSON> had said it would not comply until <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> paid more than $ 400,000 in unpaid bills. But Armtec attorney <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogovin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today that a $ 2.34 million bond <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> required <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> to post will ensure <ORGANIZATION> Armtec </ORGANIZATION> will be paid any money it is owed. `` We were holding it back because we had n't been paid and they wanted it back,'' <PERSON> Rogovin </PERSON> said. `` It was property they sent us and labor we put into it.'' Both companies are under scrutiny in the Pentagon bribery probe. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said it sued to protect <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> radar equipment from being damaged by humidity in the closed plant. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> over roughly a two-year period beginning in February, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has made fleet deployment decisions accordingly, the lawsuit said.

 Firefighters today moved toward reopening the west entrance of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where blazes involved more than 240,000 acres, and battled a wind-whipped forest fire in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> to keep it from some evacuated homes. Fires also continued to char parts of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` It's kind of a helpless situation,'' fire information officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. At Lame Deer, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, a rash of thunderstorms with winds up to 50 mph hit the fire on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation on Monday night, causing the blaze to rush three to four miles northward in a few hours, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` It just blew -LRB- the fire -RRB- in about every direction imaginable,'' he said. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said pumpers were stationed at homes near Lame Deer and at other homes near the fire. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, firefighters today planned to use a special aircraft known as a `` flying fishbowl'' to get a good look at the fires. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> arranged with <ORGANIZATION> Airborne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surveillance </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, company, for a flight by the Optica Scout over the park. The British-built aircraft has a range of vision of 270 degrees vertically and 340 degrees horizontally. Park spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON> said officials hoped to open the two roads today, a day after they were closed by a 53,000-acre fire. Winds gusting to 40 mph pushed the fire toward the road to the Old Faithful geyser area. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, a 50-acre brush fire started by an errant bullet at <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> was contained Monday night as about 50 firefighters battled the blaze. The fire that had threatened a residential area and Indian burial ground. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Busse </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, said he and his 17-year-old son, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, were target shooting on his land when a bullet from his .22 - caliber pistol ricocheted off a rock, sparking the <PERSON> Busse </PERSON> and his son tried to put out the blaze with shovels but failed, then called for help. Crews extinguished an 1,166-acre blaze on eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s Ute Indian Reservation, while firefighters completed lines around a 600-acre blaze on private land despite erratic winds that repeatedly fanned flames today. A wave of thunderstorms brought the threat of more fires to parched central and eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, officials said. High winds and no precipitation prompted <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> officials to postpone the control of a 2,175-acre fire on the Main Salmon River from Monday to Wednesday. And lightning was expected to ignite even more blazes at the <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> forests in west-central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. `` Every night we can count on getting hammered,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabinski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> information officer.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, staging a political role reversal on the eve of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination for president, shook hands and wished each other well today in an airport reunion rife with the symbolism of changing influence in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I want you to know you have all our support, all the way, and all our love,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, who had just arrived from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. With their military jets lined up on the tarmac at <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> on the outskirts of this convention city, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> kept the ceremony short, but affectionate. `` It's time to accept the great challenge that you have left for us and made possible, to build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the president whom he has served for nearly eight years. `` And I accept that challenge,'' the vice president added. `` We look forward to writing the next chapter in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s freedom story because <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s mission is greatness, and I do not intend to fail.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made light-hearted humor out of the unusual airport get-together, saying the fire chief of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> had declared the city overcrowded and that `` he's not letting in a new Republican until one leaves.'' He also poked fun at the theatrics surrounding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision-making on a vice presidential running mate, saying he'd offered to show <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> where to find blackened redfish `` if he'd tell me who's going to be the vice president `` I'm not sure he knows,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters who yelled questions to the pair about the No. 2 spot on the ticket, as the engines on Air Force One began roaring in preparation for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' departure. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was heading for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after delivering a thanks-for-the-memories speech to the convention Monday night, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> awaited a greeting rally in a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION> along the banks of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had told the convention Monday night he wanted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to `` win one more for the Gipper'' and had said he would work hard for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election, although the president conceded that `` this office is not mine to give.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech brought tears to longtime loyalists on the convention floor. It capped a day in which both he and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, talked of relinquishing the political spotlight to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. `` There are times to enter, times to stay and times to leave,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told friends at a luncheon given in her behalf. `` Today, the curtain begins to close on the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. `` We've had a wonderful run. But the time has come for the Bushes to step into the political leading roles _ and for the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> to step into the wings.'' That same theme dominated <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s convention address, preceded by a documentary about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and heralded by trumpets blaring `` Hail To The Chief.'' Standing before the 2,277 convention delegates and thousands of others in visitors' and alternates' seats, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared he still would be heard, even in retirement. `` When I pack up my bags in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, do n't expect me to be happy to hear all this talk about the twilight of my life,'' said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, 77. `` Twilight? Not in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>!'' But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also made clear that he does n't desire to command the party, saying, `` I'll leave my phone number and address behind just in case you need a foot soldier.'' Convention delegates frequently interrupted his speech with applaue, waving banners and cheering. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> even got applause a few times for things he said in the filmed narration of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. The delegates stood for several minutes and clapped their hands as he arrived at the podium, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> basked in the glory. `` Eight years ago, we gathered in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in a troubled time for our beloved country,'' he said. `` And we gathered solemnly to share our dreams.'' `` When our children turn the pages of our lives, I hope they'll see that we had a vision to pass forward a nation as nearly perfect as we could,'' he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech contained little of the acerbic, indirect criticism of Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> that was his theme upon his arrival Sunday. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not let the Democrats off the hook, even poking fun at one point at a Democratic convention speech in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, which was built around the rhetorical question of `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> played a major role in everything we've accomplished,'' he said. And in noting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed a presidential task force on reducing the burden of government paperwork, he said, `` And <PERSON> George </PERSON> was there.'' `` With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I'll know, as we approach the new millennium, our children will have a future secure with a nation at peace and protected against aggression,'' he said.

 A Syrian-backed Christian who was president when <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war began in 1975 said Tuesday he is a candidate for president, creating a crisis two days before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is to make the choice. <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, 78, pledged to stop 13 years of bloodshed. Some Lebanese see the election as a first step toward ending the war. The Lebanese Forces, the main Christian militia and an opponent of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, urged legislators not to elect a man `` who bears grudges and whose accession to power would touch off the war anew.'' Under an unwritten covenant in effect since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, the president is a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Moslem and the speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> a Shiite Moslem. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s last-minute candidacy could delay Parliament's election of a successor to President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, whose 6-year-term expires Sept. 23 Right-wing Christian leaders, including <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, have said they would use all means to block <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s election if he announced for the office. Many Christians dislike <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> because of what they see as an attempt by Moslem <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to take over its small neighbor. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 25,000 soldiers stationed in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern and northern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and more than 7,000 in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to keep the peace among warring Moslem factions. `` I shall spare no effort ... to rescue the nation and safeguard <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s unity and independence as an Arab, democratic and free country,'' <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> told a news conference at his home at <LOCATION> Ehden </LOCATION> in the Christian stronghold of north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He said his program was aimed at `` saving the nation and building a new <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'' and that `` can only be achieved through national entente.'' The Lebanese Forces issued its statement after a special meeting of the high command. `` <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON> is a confrontational candidate,'' the statement said. `` His election would rekindle the war and would lead to the partitioning of the country as well as obliterating all chances of national entente to end the civil war.'' It did not say whether the militia would use force to prevent <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s election, but urged <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to choose a `` reconciliatory president who could lead the nation out of its current impasse and bring about national entente.'' <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, was president in 1970-1976.

<HEAD>China to Raise Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> said Tuesday it is raising its interest rates, which have remained at about the same level since the 1950s, to fight inflation, end panic buying and encourage investment. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> said on nationwide television news that on Sept. 1, general loan rates would go up from 7.92 percent to 9 percent. In a break with the past, he said that when risks appear higher the interest rates would increase. Saving account interest rates will vary, he said. Rates on one-year accounts, for example, will go from 7.2 percent to 8.64 percent while those on 10-year accounts will go up from 10.44 percent to 12.42 percent. The influential Economic Daily on Monday published a front-page editorial calling for a rise in interest rates to keep in step with inflation, the highest since Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was established in 1949, and to encourage investment, which is dropping off. Since 1985, the paper said, retail prices have soared 23.7 percent, but interest rates are about the same as they were in the 1950s. It said the low rates combined with high inflation had caused panic buying throughout <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The paper cited the case of a worker in the central city of <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION> who bought enough salt to last his family for 10 years. Another family from <LOCATION> Changzhou </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Yangtze </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> valley `` in one shot bought 1,100 pounds of rice,'' it said. The report said low interest rates and easy credit were also responsible for a run on bank loans by Chinese businesses. By raising interest rates, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hopes to get people and firms not to spend money on food and consumer items but to channel it into production and investment. Two Chinese sources said Monday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would raise interest rates and, to stave off growing discontent in the cities, give workers a large raise and link further pay increases to the inflation rate. The sources, both of whom recently attended top government meetings, said the proposals were made by liberal-minded reformers allied with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. They said Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> and other conservatives have called for a complete freeze on reforms which are slowly opening the economy to market forces. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, estimated the average worker's annual salary of $ 246 would rise between 8 percent and 28 percent. In the last 10 years, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has pushed far-reaching economic reforms aimed at ending state controls over prices and allowing the value of goods to be controlled by the market. The elimination of low, government-fixed prices has caused high inflation as the inefficient economy fails to keep up with rising consumer demand. An active black market and the hoarding of goods still sold at government-set prices has exacerbated the problem.

 The small number of demonstrators at the Republican National Convention is an indication that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s critics do n't think he'll be elected, one protester says `` There's no turnout, because everybody thinks <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a goner,'' said <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Beal </PERSON>, who describes himself as a 41-year-old career protester from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Absent so far are large groups of protesters who traditionally turn out at national political conventions. Instead, those here appear to be part of a loose network of people who go from one convention-related event to another staging small demonstrations. Today, about 20 protesters held up signs and shouted in front of <ORGANIZATION> IMREG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a pharmaceutical company which manufactures one of the few promising drugs effective in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS. Demonstrators said they objected to the federal government's bureaucratic red tape that has delayed the release of drugs to treat AIDS Six demonstrators were arrested Monday at a rally for evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. Others got into a shoving match with police outside the Superdome. About 20 demonstrators marched with a police escort down Poydras Street, near the Superdome, to protest the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. But things were quiet about six blocks away at <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, the designated free-speech and demonstration gathering place for the convention. The stage built for protesters was empty all morning and much of Monday afternoon. Police assigned there milled around and sought relief from the sweltering <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> summer. Late in the day, a handful of protesters held an open-mike forum to criticize the Republican party and banged on pots with sticks. Police stopped a young Republican from stepping onto the stage to debate the demonstrators. `` We did n't expect this, but we did n't expect a big crowd, either,'' police Lt. <PERSON> R.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisant </PERSON> said of the sparse crowds. `` I do n't think there's any real issue right now to unite people.'' Moreover, he said, people in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> `` are known to be followers, not leaders, and there is no one here to unite them.'' <PERSON> Beal </PERSON> said the small number of demonstrators reflected a `` marketing decision.'' `` A decision was made by the communication networks not to mobilize and do this,'' he said. `` The single-issue groups are here but not ` the left' as a group, so you lack a coalition.'' For his part, <PERSON> Beal </PERSON> said he will return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` There are other more important things going on,'' he said, citing the Tompkins Square Park riot Aug. 7 in which residents near the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> park went on a rampage when police tried to enforce a 1 a.m. park curfew. <PERSON> Beal </PERSON> said many of his friends canceled plans to demonstrate at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> convention to work for neighborhood changes following the riot.

<TEXT>
 Golf course operators say a bad batch of fungicide turned greens brown at several courses on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today. An unidentified spokesman for the product's distributor, <ORGANIZATION> PBI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Roanoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; World-News that the fungicide had been recalled. The newspaper said the fungicide was manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and marketed under several names. Golf courses apply the chemical to kill pythium, a fungus that thrives in hot, humid weather. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Paschang </PERSON>, PBI <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> vice president for administration, did not immediately return a telephone call this morning. A secretary at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> said no one was available for comment for the rest of the week.

<HEAD>Indigent AIDS Patients Left Out In Cold After Fund Cut For AZT
Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A program that administered the drug AZT for free to 130 indigent AIDS patients will lose its federal funding next month, and officials say that will completely cut off the treatment for 66 of those patients. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> provided $ 587,000 to the state on a one-time basis to assist those patients who do not receive Medicaid and are not covered by health insurance. The money, part of a $ 30 million appropriation under the 1987 Supplemental Appropriations Act, runs out Sept. 30. AZT has been shown to relieve certain symptoms in those suffering from acquired immune deficiency syndrome or AIDS-related complex, but it is not a cure for the fatal disease. `` Without this treatment, many people who are poor and sick now run the risk of a considerably shortened life span,'' Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilber </PERSON>, medical consultant for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. Treatment for 220 medically indigent AIDS victims in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> was provided under the program beginning October 1987. Ninety of them have died, moved away, become eligible for Medicaid or were unable to take the drug, <ORGANIZATION> DHR </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Wilber </PERSON> said 64 of the remaining patients would be eligible to continue AZT treatment at <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, which provides care for poor people who live in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> and DeKalb counties. But 66 others will no longer be able to get treatment because they are not residents of the area <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> covers, <PERSON> Wilber </PERSON> said. `` Those who live in smaller towns where there is no charity hospital are just going to be cut off,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilber </PERSON> said some AIDS victims could seek assistance through Medicaid, but he cautioned that Medicaid pays for treatment only when patients are `` extremely poor,'' and even then few qualify. He speculated that some patients would relocate to <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> or DeKalb in order to receive treatment at <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilber </PERSON> said the state bought AZT in bulk at an annual cost of $ 6,566 per patient. <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> would have to buy the drug at a yearly cost of $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 per patient, and would ultimately pay an estimated $ 1 million per year to continue the AZT program, he said. <ORGANIZATION> DHR </ORGANIZATION> officials said there were 1,493 AIDS cases reported in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> as of June 1988, with 841 deaths.

<TEXT>
 The Lake Bluff Precision Lawn Mower Drill Team is looking to draft a few hot prospects for its 16th season. However, organizers warn that standards are high and the field crowded _ also, presumably, closely cropped. `` The popularity of lawn mowing and the drill team has led to an unprecedented demand for admittance to this elite unit,'' says the team's tongue-in-cheek press release. `` There have been attempts to bribe the selection committee to gain entry.'' Candidates should be equipped with a strong sense of the absurd. And a lawn mower. Anything goes, says attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a team member. `` Some are push, some are power, some are old, some are new,'' he said. The team's big day is the Fourth of July and the annual parade in this north <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, when mowers are pushed through a choreographed drill, in concentric circles and figure eights, lines weaving in and out, as members offer a commentary on current events. The recruiting drive was prompted by a dwindling in the ranks from 14 to 11, with two members moving away and a third giving up the little touch of show business because of a bum knee. Applicants are asked if they could take the physical pace, if their jobs would permit appearances on national news programs, and if their passports are in order. They're also asked: _ `` Would you be willing to donate time as a hall monitor at the Lake Buff -LRB- sic -RRB- Children's Home during the off season?'' The home was closed 10 years ago and torn down, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> notes. _ `` Would you be able to attend the Grand National Mow-Off against the <ORGANIZATION> TORO </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TORO </ORGANIZATION>, TOROs in <LOCATION> Casa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, on August 19, 1989?'' The city and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> mower team exist, but <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> says no competition has been set. _ `` Briefly critique <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>'s short story entitled ` The Unicorn in the Garden.''' Applications are also being distributed `` world-wide,'' a team statement notes. Actually, <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> says, one member took a couple of the forms along on a vacation to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Prospective members also are advised that the unit has won `` numerous local, national and international awards for its intricate marching routines and its elegant costumes and impersonations.'' That's malarkey, too, but `` we have a great time,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> says. The team was started as a joke, a spoof of the costumed Shriners' precision motorcycle units. `` Then as it got rolling, and people got more interested, we started spending more time to do what we had to do to put on a good show,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. One year, members dressed as <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sheiks for a commentary on an oil shortage. At another parade, they dressed up as brides after a movie called `` The Wedding'' was shot in their village of 5,000. Last year they traded their mowers for chain saws. The occasion? The uproar generated when Mr. T, star of `` The A-Team'' television series, had some trees cleared from his <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> estate. Dignity is not the team's strong suit, however. `` One year they had a boy running ahead, screaming ` The mowers are coming, the mowers are coming,''' said waitress <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Abel </PERSON>, 58, named this year's `` mower mother'' by team members who frequent the restaurant where she works. She keeps the application forms on hand. `` It makes good reading when you've had a few cocktails,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> says.

<TEXT>
 A homeless, unemployed former factory worker has kept a vigil for three months on the bandstand in the shadow of the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION>, saying he's determined to get justice. But many residents of <LOCATION> Pineville </LOCATION>, a town of 500 some 30 miles south of <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON> in extreme southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, see 60-year-old <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> as more ragged exhibitionist than righteous protester. During <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Days </PERSON> in July, the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> wrapped the front and sides of the bandstand in sheets of bright blue plastic to hide <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> and then parked a flatbed trailer in front of it as a replacement stage. -LRB- That annual celebration is n't what you might think. It commemorates the 1938 filming of a movie about the outlaw in <LOCATION> Pineville </LOCATION>. -RRB- The plastic remains on the bandstand, providing <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> some protection from the sun and rain and allowing passers-by to avoid his almost courtly `` good afternoon.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> members who had donated the bandstand to the city had a judge order <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> removed temporarily on June 29. But on July 5 doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said he was competent; <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> ruled the bandstand was public property and <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> could not be barred. <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> moved to the bandstand May 11 complaining he was treated unfairly after arrests on trespassing charges last winter and spring. He vowed to stay until he is granted a trial on a charge that was dismissed in April. He said dismissal is not enough; he wants to prove his innocence. He leaves only to use the courthouse restroom. Some townspeople bring him food and water, but what the divorced father of three grown children seems to crave most is conversation. `` When you've been here three months, you really appreciate it. There are some that wo n't even walk on this side of the courthouse,'' <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> said. He has had no contact with his children and fought an attempt to place him in custody of a daughter. He seems comfortable, despite the fleece-lined denim jacket, two sweaters and work boots he wears in the 90-degree heat. He has a roof and lights at night. He sleeps on a wooden bench, using a cardboard box containing his Bible and a copy of the Constitution as a pillow. He said he is a <ORGANIZATION> Jehovah </ORGANIZATION>'s Witness and trusts <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON> to sustain him until he is granted a trial. `` He told me ` sit upon this bench,' and that's where I've been ever since,'' <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> had one day in court Jan. 15 and represented himself. He was convicted of trespassing, sentenced to three days in jail and credited with time served. <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> had been arrested on the porch of a home from which he had been evicted in nearby <PERSON> Lanagan </PERSON>. Court records said deputies arrested him Dec. 21 as much for his health in the freezing weather as to uphold the law. <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON>, who said he has worked in factories and construction but now describes himself as a Bible student and teacher, returned to the porch after his conviction. According to court records, he was charged once more with trespassing. After being jailed for nearly four months awaiting trial, the charge was dismissed by County Prosecutor <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hormel </PERSON> has said the charge will not be refiled but refused to be interviewed about <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON>. Others in <LOCATION> Pineville </LOCATION> seemed weary of talking about <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON>, and resentment is evident, as in T-shirts for sale that depict <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> with the legend `` the great <LOCATION> Pineville </LOCATION> hold-up.'' Teen-agers have thrown eggs and yelled insults, but the worst <PERSON> Daywalt </PERSON> faces now are glares from a few passers-by. `` I doubt very seriously that anybody would do him any harm,'' said one man, who asked not to be identified. But `` he could die out there of a heart attack or stroke or whatever. What I would do is take him up to the court and give him about 15 minutes to tell his story. I think it's a problem that should be resolved.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, firing a new blast at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, today accused <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of spurning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests for help in the removal of mines from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` We have contacted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on several occasions at a high level to request Soviet cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> effort to clear the millions of mines that have been strewn throughout <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been specifically asked to provide maps of minefields. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has also been in touch with the Soviet government on this problem,'' she said. `` To date we're not aware of any significant Soviet effort to remove mines.'' A Soviet spokesman in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said earlier the Soviets had not deployed the mines and were, indeed, helping to remove them. But Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> did not back away from a statement Monday by spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> that mines left in place by the Soviets and the Afghan army were `` a big problem for the refugees as they contemplate returning'' to the war-torn country. Many of the mines, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, are disguised as toys; many others are so-called `` butterfly'' explosives that cause limited damage. But the overall total, which he placed at 10 million to 30 million, amounts to 1 to 3 mines for every Afghan. `` These mines are strewn throughout the countryside and so it's difficult to come up with a precise figure,'' he said <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the mines were deployed by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and by the Afghan forces engaged in an 8 -LCB- - year war with U.S.-backed guerrillas `` The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is exerting strong leadership in encouraging a program of mine-awareness and mine-detection,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. He suggested, however, there was not much the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could do right now to help _ and that the Soviets were not identifying the locations of the dangerous devices. `` I am not aware of any assistance of that kind,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. `` But, again, I guess I'd have to refer to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a definitive readout on that.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> denied the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegation. `` We would like to state again that we are not involved in any mining,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said, adding that Soviet soldiers have been helping Afghans remove and defuse mines planted by opposition forces along major roads. There were up to 115,000 Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> until the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began to withdraw under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement between the pro-Moscow government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which funneled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missiles and other arms to guerrilla factions. Half of the Soviet troops were supposed to be gone by Monday. While the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reserved judgment until the results of inspections were tallied, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> was authorized to provide an encouraging account. `` I would offer just two observations,'' he said. `` We have seen evidence of an accelerated Soviet departure from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> over the past few weeks. And, second, all of eastern and southern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> now appear to be free of Soviet forces.'' Based on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> information in hand, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` We do n't really have anything that would suggest that they're not'' adhering to their commitment The Soviets moved into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to support a pro-Moscow government at war with the U.S.-aided guerrillas. The fighting presumably will continue, however, but possibly without <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> weapons for the rebels if <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> suspends its arming of the Afghan government. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> declined to predict the outcome. In the meantime, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` Our support to the mujahedeen continues'' as they fight the government of President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> which `` does n't enjoy popular support.'' Beyond that, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said, `` I do n't think we're at a position where we could pinpoint what the future of the Afghan government is going to be, what it's going to look like.'' Many of the guerrillas, called `` freedom fighters'' by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, are fundamentalist Moslems with an outlook similar to that of the governing powers in nearby <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Last month, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were concerned about the pace of the Soviet pullout. They said Soviet military leaders had found withdrawing under rebel fire difficult and that the Soviet military commander in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> had indicated that thousands of new troops would be sent to the embattled country. The commander's remarks were conveyed to President <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Haq </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> team that is monitoring the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> then touched off alarm bells with a statement that the Soviets `` decided not only to stop their withdrawal, but they have brought in something like 10,000 troops back from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> because <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> was under threat.'' Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who were watching the situation closely said, however, there was no hard evidence that troops were returning to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, although meeting the Aug. 15 deadline could be difficult. The Soviet military commander in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> may have spoken without the authorization of his superiors in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> or he may have been trying to unsettle the Pakistanis, who channeled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to the rebels and took in hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees, officials said. `` We may never understand what happened,'' one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. `` Maybe the Soviet general was speaking prematurely or they were trying to get the Pakistanis off balance when he made the statement to <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>.'' In any event, `` The basic fact of the matter is there is no evidence of a re-introduction of Soviet troops,'' said the official, who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity.

 Thousands of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> fans toured the King's white-columned estate, lay floral teddy bears and guitars near his grave and bought <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> memorabilia today to mark the 11th anniversary of his death. `` I'm here because he lived here,'' said <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Morden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` He's just so brilliant and wonderful.'' Miss <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> came for the <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> anniversary with a group of 190 visitors from <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` I was 6 years old when I saw the first -LRB- Elvis -RRB- film, and I fell in love,'' she said. A capacity crowd of 4,000 tourists and fans was expected to tour Presley's former residence, Graceland, during the day, said <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, a Graceland spokeswoman. More than 70 stands of flowers, many shaped like guitars, hearts or teddy bears, lined a walk beside the grave. Graceland managers said fans have been upset this year by jokes fanned by a new book, `` Is Elvis Alive?'' The book theorizes that <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> is n't dead; he is only taking a career break. The rumors have not affected activities, however. The observance began Monday with a candlelight, graveside procession. `` Elvis, we miss you tonight. We will love you today, tomorrow and forever,'' <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said during a memorial program that began the late-night procession past the singer's grave. The stands of flowers lined a walk beside the grave. Many of the dozens of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fan clubs around the country traditionally schedule their floral arrangements to arrive on Aug. 16, the day Presley died. The procession, which began at 10:30 p.m. Monday, was expected to draw more than 5,000 participants. Police estimated a crowd of 3,000 at the Graceland gates waiting for the affair to get under way. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, arrived at the gates at noon Monday to be first in line. She said the long, hot wait in the 99-degree temperature was worth it. `` It's an honor to be first, and to look back and see all those candles lit is just unbelievable,'' she said. Also in the crowd were <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Campione </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and their 5-year-old son, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Campione </PERSON>, who wore a white, bejeweled jumpsuit and struck <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> poses to the delight of the other fans. Asked why he's an Elvis fan, the child replied, `` He's a nice man, and I like his music and he gives to the poor children.'' Presley died of heart disease at <LOCATION> Graceland </LOCATION> in 1977, and the faithful return by the hundreds each year to mark the anniversary. The graveside procession is the largest event of a nine-day celebration called `` Elvis International Tribute Week,'' organized and promoted by managers of Graceland. More than 35,000 people are expected to tour Graceland during the week. With <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> recordings playing in the background, the fans queued up to touch candles to a torch lighted by an eternal flame, and to walk single file up a winding, 200-yard driveway past Presley's grave beside the Graceland swimming pool `` It helps keep his memory alive,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gnadenhutten </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who sported an Elvis pompadour and a 6-inch-wide leather belt with dangling loops of chain.

 The irony of playing host to the Republican National Convention in a city that missed the prosperity of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years is n't lost on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>. `` That was another reason to have the convention here _ maybe they owed it to us,'' said <PERSON> Barthelemy </PERSON>, a Democrat. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate has been No. 1 or 2 in the country for the last three years. It was such an issue in the 1983 governor's race that <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> pledged to reject his $ 73,000 annual salary until the state's joblessness dropped below the national average. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> served his last four years gratis. It will be an issue in the November election, said former Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., who lost a bid for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, the year the President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s coattails did n't hold too many candidates <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said his defeat in 1986 was a message to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Oilmen wanted an oil import fee, but the administration refused to approve the tariff. `` I do n't believe -LRB- voters -RRB- are going to blame <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> like they did me and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1986,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` But <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> is going to be a difficult state and -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- is going to have to work hard to carry it.'' Overall, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s fortunes began to tumble with the price of oil on the world market in 1982. An estimated 152,000 jobs have been lost since then. A decreased demand for south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> petrochemical products and the competition from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with north <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> timber exacerbated the problem. In June 1979, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s unemployment rate was 7.6 percent; in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, it was 7.0 percent. The national rate was 5.6 percent, according to <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was `` on a knife's edge between inflation and recession,'' said a June 1979 LSU Business Review. The state was cut by recession. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>' out-of-work peaked at 11.7 percent in February 1985, he said. The state was at its worst since the Great Depression with a 14.5 percent jobless rate on January 1987, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. In June 1988, the state logged in with 10.5 percent unemployed, nearly twice the national rate of 5.5 percent. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> was only slightly better at 9.3 percent out of work. `` We have not been treated particularly poorly by the federal government,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>. For example, he said, federal government employment increased by 8 percent over the last five years. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the rate of growth for federal jobs was 7.4 percent.

<HEAD>Soviet Historians Defend Baltic Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet historians and officials on Tuesday defended the 1940 takeover of the Baltic states as necessary for the survival of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> at a time when it was isolated and insecure at the brink of World War II. `` It had to be decided ` to be or not to be.' We had an opportunity to choose the least of the evils and understandably we opted for the ` to be' part,'' said <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, chairman of the Novosti press agency. At a news briefing, <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> never acknowledged that <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> were forcibly incorporated into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Instead, he referred to `` the transfer of the Baltic states to the north.'' <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> was one of six panelists at the briefing who seemed to defend the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact without acknowledging its existence. The pact between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was signed Aug. 23, 1939, by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Molotov </PERSON> and German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribbentrop </PERSON>. It promised non-aggression between the two countries and _ in a secret provision _ paved the way for the Soviet takeover of the three independent Baltic states and the German invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The Estonian newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nation </ORGANIZATION> and Estonian radio last week disclosed details of the agreement for the first time in the Soviet media. Although residents of the Baltic states generally know of the agreement, some had been pressing for its publication on the basis that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should own up to its existence. Activists view the pact as proof that the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> were incorporated forcibly into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The panelists at the briefing, organized by <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, said the documents published by the Estonian newspaper have not been authenticated and they knew of no plans to publish them in <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> as well. `` The attempts to find original versions have failed,'' <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> said. `` The copies published in the press _ do they reflect what is real? This is unknown.'' Nationalist sentiment in the Baltic republics has risen, especially since Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> introduced his policy of greater openness in the country three years ago. Last year, Lithuanian, Estonian and <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> activists demonstrated on the 48th anniversary of the pact. Rallies are expected for the 49th anniversary next week. <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> believed the Germans intended to expand north by way of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, rather than westward. He said anti-communist sentiment was at a peak in the 1930s, making <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> distrustful of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` Since 1933 and 1934, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had been trying to set up a system of collective security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Regrettably, the idea was countered at the official level by negative reaction against Soviets,'' <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> said. `` It was considered better -LRB- by Western powers -RRB- to lose <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> than to save it at the hands of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The world thought was not to let the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> participate in major international decisions,'' he said. <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> characterized Polish rule at the time as `` bourgeois and semi-fascist'' and claimed the Poles and Germans were negotiating a possible joint action against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The three panelists who were from the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> said some the republics' citizens, but not the majority, opposed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s move into their region. Baltic nationalists say the Soviets moved masses of troops into the republics. When Soviet soldiers outnumbered native Baltic citizens, elections incorporating the countries into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were held. `` Estonians and Latvians fought for socialism,'' said <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuuli </PERSON>, a history professor from the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>. `` But they wanted a true socialism. Unfortunately, not all of those hopes came true. We know that the socialist system was deformed and that the purges of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and the mass deportations at the time were true.'' <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> had thousands of native Baltic citizens deported because he said they were Nazi collaborators or otherwise anti-Soviet. <PERSON> Kuuli </PERSON> called for the rehabilitation of those accused by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> of being disloyal. <PERSON> Falin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> had to make decisions about handling the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> states under `` extraordinary conditions,'' and should not be second-guessed. `` To paint him black and criticize everything that had to do with him or his decisions I do not think will do any service to the truth,'' the Novosti chief said. `` <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> pursued a course for the protection of the state interest as he understood the state interest. Do we have the right to say today that there was this and this alternative that was never taken?'' Also at the briefing were <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagar </PERSON>, a Latvian historian; <PERSON> Romas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarmaitis </PERSON>, department head of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> under the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>; historian M.I. Semiryaga; and <PERSON> L.A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bezymensky </PERSON>, a historian and political analyst for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today borrowed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` facts are stubborn things'' line in listing what he said were <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration problems that would become the central issues in the presidential campaign. The Democratic presidential nominee pointed to today's announcement that the June trade deficit had widened dramatically, to recent prime rate increases and to a report earlier in the year that serious crime had risen around the nation `` Facts are stubborn things and these are the facts that we are going to be debating,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters. `` It will be Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who has to respond to these facts.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his address to the Republican National Convention Monday night, had repeated his 1984 list of Democratic shortcomings, prefacing each with `` facts are stubborn things.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s criticism of Democrats as the party of inflation, saying, `` It's the administration that has to defend itself'' against new inflationary pressures. `` We are back in an inflationary spiral,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a meeting of newspaper editors from central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` It's the direct result of eight years of fiscal irresponsibility.'' `` The vice president is going to have to defend'' the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> fiscal record, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know how he is going to do it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the environment, saying, `` Republicans came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bound and determined to destroy the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-'' and that `` the vice president was part of that.'' `` This administration's record on the environment is zero,'' he said. He also denounced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for vetoing the defense authorization bill, saying the president made a `` strictly political veto'' of a measure that had broad bipartisan support. `` Now we've got mass confusion in addition to all the scandal,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That's not the way you build a strong America.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said leadership, and not Republican name-calling, will determine the winner in November. `` I do n't think it's going to do any political damage,'' the Democratic presidential nominee said of the Dukakis-bashing taking place at the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> gathering in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor dismissed the criticism, and predicted <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal popularity will not give much of a boost to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited an ` L' word of his own _ leadership _ to counter the `` liberal'' tag placed on him by Republicans. `` The ` L' word in this campaign is leadership,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Shrewsbury </LOCATION> during the first day of a two-day visit to central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` In the last analysis, people are going to be looking at me and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and they are going to be looking at which one of us has the leadership abilities.'' He noted that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaigned actively for GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates in 1986 but could not keep Democrats from regaining control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 The Legislature today overwhelmingly approved a bill aimed at doing away with a century-old county purchasing system the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> found was rife with corruption. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the bill 111-7 and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 50-0. It now goes to Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, who had hailed the measure as `` a tremendous victory against corruption and for effective government.'' `` For the first time, the government of the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> is on record for honest and efficient government,'' <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said after the legislation won final approval. Passage came on the seventh day of a special session called by <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> in response to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe of purchasing practices that resulted in the arrest of 56 supervisors in 25 counties on charges ranging from mail fraud to extortion. The Legislature had failed in this year's regular session to agree on anti-corruption legislation. The bill would require counties to adopt central purchasing systems, some form of which already exists in 22 of the state's 82 counties, but leaves in voters' hands exactly how far the reorganization should go. Currently, county supervisors oversee all purchasing in their districts. The new system would give an appointed administrator power over day-to-day purchasing for the entire county, while keeping policy in the hands of supervisors. However, the bill gives voters in each county the right to veto by referendum the centralizing of road projects _ by far the biggest purchasing projects at the county level. As state auditor for the four years preceding his election as governor in 1987, <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> assisted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in its investigation. Of the 56 supervisors charged, 42 have pleaded guilty, six have been convicted and one has been acquitted.

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said today that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s coattails `` will be very short'' in helping <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> try to win the presidency. Asked about the president's speech Monday night to the Republican National Convention, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had `` an adoring crowd, and they enjoyed each other.'' `` I also believe that in the convention, and after the convention, as we go into the election, that it's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> people are looking to, not <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' he said. `` And <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s coattails will be very short.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's comments came during a visit to the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> here, a stop designed to show off the Democratic ticket's support for the program. The six underground petroleum reserves are vaults of crude oil that can be tapped in a national emergency. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told about 50 workers at the plant that their program is crucial `` to the national security of the country.'' It was the latest stop in <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s home state campaign to grab all the attention he can in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> while the Republicans dominate the national news from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> on Monday was in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> talking about another industry in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> that has suffered lately _ the space program. He visited the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and announced that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would favor building a permanent manned space station. `` We will support an all-out effort to restore <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leadership in exploring the universe,'' he said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is a long-time supporter of the space station, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the administration has failed to bring the space agency back to top form since the Challenger disaster. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also announced that if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were elected, the new president would quickly reinstitute a Cabinet-level council on space with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator at its head. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, another Texan, was put in charge of the space council when he was vice president. The board was later abolished by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has killed efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to put it back in operation. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has 29 electoral votes, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is trying to make good on his boast that the Democrats will carry the state this fall. The nine-day campaign trip, almost entirely in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was designed to keep his name in the papers and on local television while Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, another Texan, is receiving all that attention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` We're doing everything we can in these local markets to blow the Republicans off the front page,'' said campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>,

 A mentally disturbed man who said he is the son of God was held in the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail Tuesday in connection with the desecration of sacred synagogue scrolls last week, police said. <PERSON> Delfin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 30, was charged with two counts of felony mischief after he was taped by a television news crew explaining why he twice went to the <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> Community Synagogue, unrolled the Torah, then left it on the floor. The incidents occurred last Wednesday and Thursday nights. `` He said that's pretty much what the son of God should be doing _ reading the word of God,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> has confessed to the incidents, which sparked cries of anti-Semitism and led a tearful Rabbi <PERSON> Tibor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> to call for a fast to purify the holy scrolls. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who receives medication at a mental health center, did not steal anything or mark the scrolls, but he removed one from its velvet case and unfurled it on the floor, <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said. Police said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> had returned to the synagogue Friday afternoon with plans to read the Torah again when he was approached by a <ORGANIZATION> WCIX </ORGANIZATION> television news crew, on the scene to do a story about the incidents the previous two days. He explained himself and then fled. Arrested Saturday evening, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> confessed.

 A federal appeals court today upheld the conviction of a former follower of the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> for conspiring in the murder of a congressman hours before the mass murder-suicide at Peoples Temple in 1978. In a 3-0 decision, the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> rejected arguments that a tape-recorded speech by <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was improperly used against <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Layton </PERSON> and that <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>'s lawyers provided an inadequate defense. <PERSON> Layton </PERSON>, the only former <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> member prosecuted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, was convicted in 1986 of conspiring with <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and others to murder Rep. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, shot to death at an airstrip in the Central American country of <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a Democrat from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area, had just concluded a visit to the temple's jungle compound, <LOCATION> Jonestown </LOCATION>, to investigate complaints against the religious cult.

 A fugitive eluded police for 12 years by borrowing a dead man's name from a newspaper's obituary columns and assuming his identity, authorities said. <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, 38, was arrested Monday night on charges of drug trafficking and violation of probation in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. He was posing as <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundell </PERSON>, a man who died more than a decade ago in the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, area, said special agent <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION>. `` He was shocked that we located him,'' said <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> had a driver's license, Social Security card, insurance papers and credit cards bearing <PERSON> Brundell </PERSON>'s name, <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON> said, adding, `` He's assumed that name lock, stock and barrel.'' Also going by the name of <LOCATION> Brundell </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Vikki </PERSON>, and their 8-year-old son. `` His son learned for the first time tonight that his name was n't <PERSON> Brundell </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Fortier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> for theft and resisting arrest 10 years ago.

<HEAD>Striking Workers Demand Reinstatement of Solidarity Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 4,000 workers went on strike Tuesday at a coal mine in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and demanded the legalization of the banned Solidarity trade union, activists said. The occupation strike came on the eighth anniversary of the birth of the outlawed trade union federation in the port city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. Witnesses said about 600 police took up positions around the <LOCATION> Manifest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lipcowy </LOCATION> mine near the city of <LOCATION> Jastrzebie </LOCATION>. A Solidarity adviser said there were no reports of violence and police made no attempt to move into the facility. The security forces, which were called in by mine management, cordoned off the mine, and public transportation to the facility was suspended, said the Solidarity adviser, <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON>. The mine's management informed strikers over loudspeakers that it considered the strike illegal, then declared the mine closed until further notice, he said. Mine director <PERSON> Karol </PERSON> <PERSON> Grzywa </PERSON> ordered `` anyone not directly engaged in works toward securing the mine's property to leave the premises,'' the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. As of Tuesday night, 700 workers still were in the mine, the news agency said. `` The strike is clearly political in nature,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said, adding that wage demands were not high on the miners' agenda. <PERSON> Legalizaton </PERSON> of the Solidarity union is among the chief demands made by the miners, said Solidarity spokeswoman <PERSON> Katarzyna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketrzynska </PERSON>. The workers also want mine management to reinstate workers fired for independent trade union activities, she said, adding that the workers also are demanding better working conditions and pay increases. The action began when the overnight shift refused to take up their tools. They were joined by workers arriving for the morning shift, <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> said mine management then locked out members of the afternoon shift to prevent them from joining the strike. Solidarity spokesmen said workers at the nearby <LOCATION> Borynia </LOCATION> mine staged a brief sympathy rally, but went back to work at noon. Jastrzebie is located about 280 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in the heart of <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s most vital industrial and mining region. Security officials, meanwhile, briefly detained 10 Solidarity leaders at the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> copper mine near the city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> in lower <LOCATION> Silesia </LOCATION>. That mine also has been the scene of unrest in recent months, with workers demanding improved safety conditions. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugalski </PERSON>, a Solidarity activist in the region, said two crews were taken to the mine's management building for `` safety training.'' There was no production at the mine Tuesday, he said. Workers at the <LOCATION> Rudna </LOCATION> mine staged a protest rally on Monday. Most of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s heavy industry is located in the <LOCATION> Silesian </LOCATION> region. Its coal and copper mines supply raw materials for the nation's vital steel and shipbuilding industries. On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> joined striking shipyard workers and jointly declared their demands for the formation of an independent trade union federation. The Solidarity trade union federation was suppressed in 1981 when the government imposed martial law. It was banned a year later by parliament.

 <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>'s teachings are being ignored by those who would prevent others from seeing `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' says actress <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>, the movie's <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. `` It's so obvious, when you see the film, that its intentions are religious,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>, who introduced the movie's director, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, to the <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> novel upon which the movie is based `` These people have a perfect right not to see the film, but they do n't have a right to tell everyone else that they ca n't,'' she said. Fundamentalist Christians have protested the movie since it opened in seven cities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> last week. `` Christ's teachings are about love and generosity, and I'm certainly not seeing that in these demonstrations,'' the actress said in a telephone interview from her <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> home `` What happened to ` Judge not lest ye be judged' and ` Let he who is without sin cast the first stone?''' Ms. <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON>, whose credits include `` <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> and Her Sisters'' and `` Tin Men,'' told Scorsese about the book in 1972 when they were working together on the movie `` Boxcar Bertha.'' `` As I got to know him I could see his wit and humor, and the incredibly complex investment he had in religion,'' she said. `` I immediately thought of the book in terms of <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>. I told him he should make it into a film. `` He says I also told him that I should play <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. I do n't remember actually saying that, but it sure sounds like me.'' Years later, when the film finally was being cast, she recalled, `` I auditioned for months. I did three screen tests.'' `` <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> told me later that he had me work so hard because I really had to prove to him that I was the best for the role. He did n't want to give it to me for any obligatory reasons.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying he has chosen his running mate but is still keeping it secret, arrived today to take command at the Republican convention and launch his uphill struggle for the White House. `` I do not intend to fail,'' he declared. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, passing the torch to his political partner of nearly eight years, said, `` A great deal rides on this campaign, and on you are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s hopes for continued peace and prosperity.'' Shortly after arriving, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his staff began making telephone calls to people who were not chosen. Among those contacted were <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told him the vice presidential nominee would not come from the South. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as saying, `` We do n't need to go South for a running mate.'' That would seem to rule out at least former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and former Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff. Former Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who is married to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, is a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native. The vice president said his decision about a running mate will be announced `` before Thursday night'' when he addresses the convention and accepts its presidential nomination. He admonished reporters `` not to play the game of 20 questions'' with him. At a ceremony at a military air base 20 miles from town, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met briefly and then headed their separate ways, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> en route to a long vacation in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> making a triumphant entry in the convention city. `` Hail and farewell,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. The president, asked by reporters about the identity of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, said, `` I do n't know. He has n't told me. I'm not sure he knows.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly interjected, `` No, I know.'' Just before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boarded Air Force One, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leaned over and whispered something in the president's ear. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nodded. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said she thought the vice president told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> the running mate's name. Moments earlier, standing alongside the president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` By the time you leave office ... you will have done for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the greatest thing that a president could do; you will have left this country better than you found it, and today <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can see further because of your vision and now it is time to extend that vision into the next century. `` It is time to accept the challenge that you have left for us and made possible, to build a better <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the vice president said. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s mission is greatness and I do not intend to fail.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who electrified the convention with a farewell speech Monday night, jokingly told the airport audience, `` I just tried to make a deal with <PERSON> George </PERSON>, that I would tell him where to find the best blackened redfish if he'd tell me who is going to be vice president.'' At the end of the ceremony, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> introduced his three Mexican-American grandchildren to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` the little brown ones.'' The three children _ <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noelle </PERSON>, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> _ are the children of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>, and his Mexican-born wife, <PERSON> Columba </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` will do a lot of campaigning'' for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` We're going to have four or five events next week in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; he's going to make at least a couple trips a week between now and the election,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` wo n't get personal; he wo n't talk about <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but he'll talk about Republicans and Democrats and conservatives and liberals in a way that you wo n't mistake the difference. In addition to finally making his vice presidential choice, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he also was ready with the speech he will deliver Thursday night, an address that delegates say is crucial to set the tone for his fall campaign. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he practiced the speech on the plane on the way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I checked it out with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>,'' he said. `` She stayed awake for the whole thing. I feel comfortable with what we've got.'' Asked when he had made up his mind about a vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Just before I climbed onto this plane. Today, and with finality.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said no one on the plane knew the name of his running mate, not even his wife or campaign chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. As the gavel fell this morning, opening the second day of the convention, speculation about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate centered on Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, Sens. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, Atty. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, former Sen. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. Also churned up by the rumor mill were the names of Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he had was not offended by <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s complaints Monday about the selection process. `` I took no offense at that. Pressure mounts.'' The vice president watched <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech on television Monday night and then said he would `` do my level best to fill those big shoes of President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON>, I'm in your corner,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared in an emotionally charged valedictory speech to a Superdome audience packed to the rafters. `` But <PERSON> George </PERSON>, just one more personal request: go out there and win one for the Gipper.'' Without debate or dissent, delegates in the half-empty convention hall today chorused approval of a conservative platform for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to use in his battle against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The 40,000 word document pledges no tax increases, calls for a constitutional amendment to ban abortion and promises `` rapid and certain deployment'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> missile defense plan, also known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. The document embraces <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign proposals by endorsing child-care tax credits for low-income families, increased spending on Head Start and a new `` merit schools'' program, and tax-free savings bonds to pay for college. There was not a single dissenting report for the full convention to debate. For his part, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remained at home, shrugging off attacks from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think it's going to do any political damage,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said. `` In the last analysis, people are going to be looking at me and Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and they are going to be looking at which one of us has the leadership.''

 Someplace over <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> or maybe <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, winging his way to the Republican National Convention, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> unsheathed his Thursday night acceptance speech and rehearsed it for his wife. `` She stayed awake for the whole thing,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in describing Tuesday's mid-air drama. For the whole thing! She stayed awake `` for the whole thing.'' There he goes again. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is raising expectations for his convention-climax address. It is a pressure situation. He is no <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, but he'll do OK. This was not quite the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> approach. Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, does not enjoy a reputation as a marvelous and commanding public speaker. People laugh at his dense delivery and his seemingly endless repetition of sophomoric rhetoric. A real war, not a phoney war on drugs. Good jobs at good wages, and I do n't mean flipping hamburgers and doing other people's laundry. Zorba the Clerk, the critics called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. So the expectations were pretty low for the Democratic nominee's convention speech _ and that was before <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> took her catnap When it comes to lowering expectations, the <PERSON> Kittycatnap </PERSON> will go down in history. To hear <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tell it, he'd spent the better part of a week mulling and writing and honing his acceptance speech when <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> asked if she could take a look. `` I said OK and she went into the bedroom,'' he said. `` When I went into the room myself to get my jacket, my wife was fast asleep on the bed and the speech was beside her, half read.'' And so when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> gave his address, and it was good, and it was delivered with passion and force, he seemed transformed. As the saying goes, that's the way to do it ... For better or worse, that is n't the way <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going about his business. He knows expectations are low and he figures if he does n't stand up for himself, who will? And so full tilt, he has been raising expectations, even to the extent of borrowing the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> catnap anecdote and turning it upside down for <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. To hear <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tell it, he is the Comeback Kid, weighing in and bragging in advance that it's in the bag. He told <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'': `` You're an athlete. I'm an athlete. There's a lot of pressure out there, you can feel it building. But I've been in pressure situations before.'' Republican delegates are well aware of the importance of the Thursday night address if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to overtake <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` I think his image should be sharpened, and his acceptance speech should do that'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin-Lee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. `` He can low key it for a while, but not much longer.'' `` He needs to improve his image, but I do n't know what he should do,'' said delegate <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>. `` One thing _ he ought to get horn-rimmed glasses instead of those awful clear ones he wears now.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> of <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, said it will help that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is now out from under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s shadow. `` His lightbulb was under somebody else's shade, and when he turns it on, he'll be all right,'' <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> said. `` I think when people get an idea of his background, how deep he is, the polls will take care of themselves.''

<HEAD>Pilots' Union Leader Says Airlines Must Improve Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commerical airlines are jeopardizing safety by putting more high-technology planes into service without properly training pilots to use them, the leader of the airline pilots' largest union said Tuesday <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing 41,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilots, said an overloaded air traffic control system and a shortage of experienced pilots made the need for better pilot training even more crucial. `` Even though this need has long been recognized, very little has been done to improve pilot training,'' he told an air safety forum sponsored by the pilots union. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said a combination of new problems in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline industry, including inadequate training for pilots flying high-technology aircraft with fully automated cockpits had led to `` an erosion of the critical margin of safety that's absolutely necessary'' in the operation of commercial air carriers. `` We ca n't continue to chip away at this safety margin and not expect to suffer the consequences,'' he said. An independent expert told the pilots forum that the introduction of fully automated cockpits, while reducing the frequency of human errors, had made some pilots feel alienated from the aircraft. `` The pilot feels himself moved from the center of the cockpit to the periphery,'' said <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON>, an air safety expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. As a joke meant to illustrate this feeling of alienation, <PERSON> Wiener </PERSON> listed what he called the questions most frequently asked by pilots in advanced cockpits: `` What is it doing now? `` Why did it do that? `` What is it going to do next?''

<TEXT>
 Both <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet nuclear scientists prepared elaborate detection equipment Tuesday for a historic nuclear weapons test in which both superpowers will be represented at the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Test Site. `` Technically, everything looks A-OK,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>. Wednesday's test, code-named <PERSON> Kearsarge </PERSON>, will be the ninth conducted at the desert site this year and the 684th announced shot there since January 1951. Some of the Soviet scientists have been at the town of Mercury for six of this year's previous tests, but <PERSON> Kearsarge </PERSON> is the first time nuclear scientists from either country have been allowed on the other's highly sensitive sites. Wednesday's test is designed to test the ability of the two countries to measure the size of each other's nuclear tests. Such verification is needed to determine whether the two superpowers are living within the 150-kiloton limit set in treaties that were signed in 1974 and 1976 but never ratified. Scientists and diplomats said the experiment is a critical first step toward a possible test ban. Diplomats who helped forge the historic event were at Mercury, a tiny town 65 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> that serves as a base camp for the nation's nuclear tests. Some 45 Soviet nuclear scientists were scheduled to be on site for Wednesday's detonation, with most of them watching from a control point 30 miles from ground zero. A like number of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nuclear scientists are scheduled to witness a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear test at the Soviet site at <LOCATION> Semipalatinsk </LOCATION> in mid-September. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet scientists checked out sophisticated equipment Tuesday that is housed in trailers a few hundred yards from ground zero. The trailer areas were fenced off and armed guards checked everyone entering and leaving. Signs on the fence read: `` Security Area: Deadly Force Authorized.'' The crew of a DOE helicopter patrolling the site picked up two anti-nuclear protesters in a remote desert canyon on a bombing and gunnery range adjoining the secret site. They were taken to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 95 west of the test site and released. The $ 25 million test, known as the Joint Verification Experiment, comes nearly four years after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed such a project in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The verification tests were agreed to by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and General Secretary <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> summit last December. Scientists from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be measuring the explosive punch of a thermonuclear device The device scheduled for detonation was encased in a steel canister buried 2,020 feet beneath the scenic 7,500-foot mesa. The canister, painted red, white and blue, was 8 feet tall, 88 inches in diameter and weighed 7 -LCB- tons. Soviet scientists were allowed to look at the canister only after it was sealed.

 Cool comfort is so coveted in this steamy convention city that hosts are paying $ 1 per square foot to air-condition party tents. The goal is red-hot good times, not red-hot guests. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> is a busy man. Friend to climate-conscious party-givers, his company is providing tons of equipment to pump 75-degree air into tents for lawn parties during the Republican National Convention. Twenty-inch ducts connect <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>'s air conditioners to tubes running the length of a tent. Chilled air is forced out through small holes to give evenly-spaced comfort _ a ceiling-fan effect. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> said that's a technical advance. `` We used to physically set the equipment inside the tent,'' he explained. `` And some lady would spend $ 200 on a hairdo. Then they'd walk in front of the blowers. Poof! Big trouble.'' Republicans can beat sticky heat in the climate-controlled <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Superdome, but shirts are soaked after a stroll to the French Quarter. Bar signs on Bourbon Street tout air conditioning like a specialty drink. Former Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, the rejected nominee for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, cracked at a reception for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> celebrities, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave us a preview of another great public policy issue _ the greenhouse effect.'' That got an understanding laugh. But not from <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Logan </PERSON>. He's the guy inside a towering State of Liberty costume topped by a 25-pound mask, rented out as a living decoration for parties. `` Yes, sir, I'd say it's hot in here. I'm sweating,'' <PERSON> Logan </PERSON> said on the unshaded steps of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>. As <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> spoke, the temperature was in the high 90s and the heat index, which computes comfort based on humidity and thermometer readings, reached 104 degrees. `` It's a great city, but the heat is hard to get used to,'' said <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doria </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> delegate. `` I'm glad a lot of these parties are indoors.'' City councilman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Early </PERSON>, who planned one of convention week's biggest parties, shrugged about the city's surpassing its average daily August high of 90.6 degrees `` It's impossible to go through one day in August without at least a drop of rain,'' Early said. `` And the heat _ it's a way of life.''

<TEXT>
 Republican delegates chorused their approval Tuesday of a book-length 1988 platform that courts conservatives, cudgels Democrats and commits the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to a child care tax credit as well as rapid deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the platform chairman, called it `` a rallying cry for all those who share our values.'' There was neither dissent nor debate on a single plank. The hall was half-empty as <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> and other platform leaders spent 45 minutes singing the praises of their 40,000-word declaration of philosophy, titled, `` An American Vision: For Our Children and Our Future.'' `` I did n't hear any no's,'' <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said after finishing her work and producing a document that speaks to scores of issues, from the space-based defense shield that it extols to a heifer tax that it opposes. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who has said it would cost $ 43 billion to carry out programs implicit in the Democrats' platform, was unable to say how much it would cost to make good on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s promises. Pressed for an estimate, she said, `` It's a busy week.''

 Later, in a speech to the convention's evening session, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> boasted that the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> document `` is far, far superior to the platform the Democrats cobbled together in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.'' `` You wo n't find some very basic words in the Democratic platform _ words like ` tax' or ` revenue' or ` unemployment.' You wo n't find any mention of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. You wo n't find the words ` church' or ` synagogue' ... `` <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said. `` They do n't want the people to know that they are still the party that will raise taxes and weaken our defense.''

 <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> called it `` our love-letter to the American family.'' She said the platform `` stands on our Judeo-Christian tradition. ... It spells the doom of corruption in government and of pornography.'' `` We're not just against abortion. We're for adoption reform ... for more tax relief for families -LRB- and -RRB- an all-out crusade against infant morality and birth defects,'' she said. Even mothers at home with kids would benefit from the child care tax credit because `` Republicans know every mom is a first-class mom, and we're going to help them all,'' said <PERSON> Thayer </PERSON>. `` It's hard to take a stand on controversial issues, but we Republicans would rather take a stand than take a walk,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis </LOCATION>. The platform toes the conservative line on taxes, abortion and defense. It accuses the Democrats of tolerating corruption and calls for subjecting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> itself to civil rights, health and safety laws. The 104-page text is 25 percent longer than the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform and eight times the length of the bare-bones platform the Democrats approved in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> four weeks ago. The GOP platform echoes the 1984 document in pledging no tax increases, calling for a constitutional `` human life'' amendment to ban abortion and promising `` peace through strength.'' It promotes <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s positions in favor of child-care tax credits for low-income families, increased funds for Head Start, a new `` merit schools'' program, and tax-free savings bonds for college. It calls for ` compassion and help'' for those who suffer from AIDS, but also stresses the need to `` protect those who do not have the disease.'' It became certain Monday there would be no minority planks when the 106-member <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the document with only two dissenting votes: Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Boatwright </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. No one attempted to gather the 27 signatures needed to file a minority report. <PERSON> Boatwright </PERSON> was returning home after injuring her leg Monday in an escalator mishap.

 More than 200 people are imprisoned without charge in <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> and many have been tortured, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a report on human rights in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> country. The report alleges that some of the prisoners have been detained for up to three years, while 100 were arrested in March and April on suspicion of being involved in a conspiracy against the government. The human rights organization identified most of the prisoners as armed forces personnel, including a police chief, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Kouyami </PERSON>, and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> identified only as Capt. <PERSON> Hountondji </PERSON>. The arrests over the alleged conspiracy took place in the area of <LOCATION> Abomey </LOCATION>, capital of the former kingdom of <LOCATION> Dahomey </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. The country's name was changed from <LOCATION> Dahomey </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> in 1975. It said <PERSON> Abomey </PERSON> was `` an area of considerable economic unrest'' caused by government measures introduced in recent months, including a reported plan to store <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> nuclear waste in <LOCATION> Saklo </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> Abomey </LOCATION>. Official Beninois sources have since reported that <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> has shelved the plan, which provoked sharp protest from neighboring countries. The report said at least half the prisoners held without trial `` are prisoners of conscience ... imprisoned solely for the non-violent exercise of their basic human rights to freedom of expression and association.'' It said at least one prisoner, <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Glele </PERSON> <PERSON> Akpokpo </PERSON>, died in custody. It said prisoners were subjected to prolonged beatings and whippings, sometimes in front of spectators. One form of torture described by former prisoners is the `` rodeo,'' in which victims are made to crawl on sharp, stony ground while being beaten. <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, a former French colony, became independent in 1960 and underwent six military coups until 1972, when the present president, French-trained paratrooper <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerekou </PERSON>, seized power and installed a Marxist government.

 - <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ORLEANS </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ With fetes and eats and welcoming arms, in hotels and meeting halls and restaurants across this convention-consumed city, business is buddying up to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Try Suite 2886 of the Hilton hotel, where the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> beckons with free liquor, hors d'oeuvres and a river view. The catch so far: a hundred bites, with Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> as the biggest fish. Uninterested in tales of the travails of the nation's supermarkets Try the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> hospitality suite. Hit <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>'s free food at <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Drop by the reception sponsored by Middle South Utilities. The enticements are many. The official convention calendar lists more than 50 corporate-sponsored parties for delegates, party and elected leaders and aides this week. Many more events did not make the list. Such affairs are nothing new to the political scene; many of the same companies held similar parties for the Democrats in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month. Their credo: Ideology aside, in politics, goodwill is good business. `` There's no arm twisting, no hard sell. It's primarily meet and greet and make friends,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedlob </PERSON>, a delegate from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` They have a chance to tell their story to an audience that's willing to listen.'' As straightforward as it may seem, however, the corporate presence is troubling to some delegates who fear having the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> tagged as the party of big business. `` The whole issue is how organizations _ corporations, associations of interest groups _ finance candidates and do favors for candidates. I find it a disturbing one,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemmers </PERSON>, an alternate delegate from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` My concern is appearances.'' `` You have a lot of money flowing around,'' she said. `` The source of that money is always going to be open to question about its intended purpose.'' <PERSON> Nemmers </PERSON> nonetheless attended a <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> reception for <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> at a posh hotel this week _ because, she said, it was her only chance to see them in an intimate setting. The free spread included champagne and bloody Marys, eggs <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> and sliced kiwis. Were she running for public office back in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nemmers </PERSON> was quick to say, `` I'd have avoided it like the plague.'' Another elected official, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> himself, did not share those reservations about corporate sponsorships, though both he and his wife were defensive in commenting on the business-backed events. `` We know all the people anyway. It's nice,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` ` They live here and they have business here and they want to be welcomed and I think it's great. Nothing sinister about it.'' `` I do n't know anything about that really. ... I was not in on any of the planning of the events,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> transportation secretary. `` They asked to be hosts. ... People are enjoying it and the idea is to have a good time. So I do n't see that there's any problem with that.'' One or both of the Doles were listed on the official schedule for eight business-sponsored receptions and lunches this week, courtesy of groups from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>. One of the biggest corporate players is <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>: The regional phone company is sponsoring a dozen events this week, including a brunch for 150 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members, state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairmen and executives. <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> also runs a free lunchroom for the news media. `` We're a major player in the telecommunications industry,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattoon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> lobbyist. `` We want to be involved with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others who are involved in our issues.'' There are other ways for corporations to spread good will at political conventions. Many donated to the fund <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> established to defray its costs; others are paying up to $ 100,000 for tables at a gala fund-raiser for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> this week. While corporations ca n't give directly to political candidates, they can give to the party _ and sponsor parties. Take <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. It's running two hospitality suites, one equipped with first-class airplane seats for visitors who want a snooze. It's buying lunch for the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> delegation _ <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is the hub of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> took over last year _ and it's laying out a six-course luncheon at <ORGANIZATION> Arnaud </ORGANIZATION>'s, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> quarter restaurant, for 200 guests, led by lawmakers with a hand in transportation policy. `` If somebody knows you they can believe what you're saying,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>. `` They can come to you and say, ` Delta, this bill is surfacing, what do you think of it? Is it good for the industry or bad?' `` We like that input. We need that input. This is a chance for us to be known by these people, and for us to know them.''

<HEAD>Prisoners Released, Students Call For More Protests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> said Tuesday it has released 51 people who were detained during bloody anti-government protests last week that led to the resignation of President <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>. The release came as student groups in the capital of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> distributed leaflets calling for more protests Wednesday against <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s one-party government, diplomats and journalists said. The official radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said the 51 prisoners released from Insein prison on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> included 37 male students, 10 female students and four civilians. It also said 30 people arrested earlier this month in disturbances in <LOCATION> Pegu </LOCATION>, 45 miles northeast of the capital, were freed on Sunday. The releases were the first since violent nationwide demonstrations ended Friday with the resignation of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, a hardline former general. <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangoon </PERSON> said a week ago that authorities had arrested more than 700 demonstrators. Later, it reported 1,451 arrests in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> but did not make clear if that included the 700 mentioned earlier. The protests were the most massive since <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> achieved independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1948. In a sweep last month following <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>'s elevation to the top post, authorities arrested the country's most prominent dissident, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, as well as <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> correspondent Sein Win. There was no indication that they were among those who were freed. Life in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> continued its slow return to normal Tuesday. Soldiers maintained their guard on police stations for fear of attacks similar to those in which three policemen were beheaded by protesters last week. A Western diplomat in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> said trucks and tanks with up to 200 soldiers were parked on Merchant Street in the center of the city, about 200 yards from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The show of force `` appeared to be a precaution because posters called for continued protests,'' said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the vehicles were gone by Tuesday, and there was only a light troop presence in the rest of the capital. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the country's legislature have scheduled emergency sessions for Friday, presumably to choose a successor to <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who served only 17 days and was hated for brutally crushing dissent <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> took over when <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> resigned abruptly as leader after 26 years of authoritarian rule. Most analysts believe the country's next ruler will be an active or retired military officer from the enduring hierarchy of Ne Win, whose coming to power in a 1962 military coup ended <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s experiment with democracy Diplomats and tourists arriving in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> on Tuesday said among the seven demands listed by protesters in leaflets and posters were a multiparty democracy, the release of political dissidents including <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, a court trial of <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, and the legalization of student unions. Students also have called for major changes in leadership, reductions in the cost of living and compensation for families of people killed or wounded in last week's demonstrations. In a sign of discontent within the system, 177 Burmese lawyers signed a document charging that by firing against peaceful demonstrators, including children, security forces violated the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> constitution and the U.N. Declaration of Human Rights. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agencies reported from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> that the Lawyer's Council, an organization under the government's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorneys </ORGANIZATION>, submitted its protest to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, or president's office. Radio <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> has said at least 95 people were killed and 240 wounded in protests in two dozen towns last week, but Western diplomats believe the toll was much higher. No major rallies have been reported since <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> resigned. But a senior Western diplomat said the recent leaflet and poster campaign indicated massive street protests would resume unless authorities meet demands for leadership changes and multiparty democracy. Another Rangoon-based diplomat said that while some students would be satisfied with nothing less than dismantling one-party rule, `` rank-and-file'' protesters might stay off the streets if authorities make gradual concessions.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said Tuesday that government policy `` is drifting aimlessly'' under President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, and he gave her one week to resign. A Roman Catholic cardinal urged the leaders to settle their differences. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Teodoro </PERSON> <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has not replied to a letter from Laurel that accused her government of incompetence and urged her to resign and call new elections. `` I do n't want to appear to be threatening her, so I give her one week,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> told reporters. He did not elaborate. In the letter, released Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> offered to resign along with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. If she refused, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said he would `` dissociate'' himself from her government. `` If she does not resign, I will not resign -LRB- as vice president -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> said. `` I will simply disengage myself from her administration and speak out freely to expose all the acts that are prejudicial to the national interest.'' He said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was running the government without direction and basing her decisions on maintaining her popularity. `` -LRB- Her policy -RRB- is drifting aimlessly, swaying wherever the wind blows,'' said Laurel. `` What happens is that the ship of state is moving nowhere. It's not anchored ... She tries to please everybody, but in the end she will please nobody.'' Cardinal <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> said it would not be wise for Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to resign `` as it will create a stoppage of ongoing government programs.'' `` Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s resignation will have a big negative effect on the administration,'' <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON> told reporters. `` So I propose that she and Laurel sit down and talk their problems over to prevent a discontinuity in government.'' The country's other cardinal, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sin </PERSON>, said he would not offer advice in the dispute unless `` there is an occasion.'' In 1985, Sin convinced Laurel to abandon his presidential ambitions and run as Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s vice presidential candidate against President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was ousted in a civilian-military uprising that brought the current government to power. Laurel's growing isolation from the Aquino administration began in September, when he resigned as foreign secretary because of `` fundamental differences.'' On Monday, <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> met with leaders of political opposition groups _ including Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> _ to try to assemble a new opposition alliance. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said he supported <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>'s position on Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, but stopped short of endorsing early elections. The next presidential election is scheduled for May 1992.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> wo n't speed up its withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> because Moslem guerrillas there have rejected political overtures and continue fighting the Soviet-backed government, the government said Tuesday.

It directed that the withdrawal begin May 15, with half the Soviet forces gone by Aug. 15 and all removed from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, 1989. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statement confirmed Tuesday that the Aug. 15 deadline had been met. The guerrillas have increased their attacks on Afghan government troops and there will be no early Soviet withdrawal unless the insurgents stop fighting and join a proposed governing coalition, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. `` For the time being there is no possibility to reduce the plan for withdrawing Soviet troops,'' he declared. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had indicated the Kremlin would like all its soldiers home by the end of the year. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the second phase of the withdrawal would begin in November. Afghan guerrillas began fighting after a Communiist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered the country in December 1978. More than 5 million people have fled <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. At least 3 million live in border cities and camps in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that serve as bases and supply points for the insurgents. The guerrillas were not a party to the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement and, when it was signed, said they would continue the civil war. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported `` fierce fighting'' Tuesday in <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>, a provincial capital captured by insurgents when Soviet troops abandoned it two weeks ago. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said Monday his forces had recaptured the city, but guerrilla groups claimed Tuesday their fighters were holding it. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, Afghan soldiers killed 100 insurgents Monday and Tuesday around <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. The city is north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the capital, and near the route used by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops moving north to the Soviet border. Guerrillas also claim to have captured <PERSON> Talogan </PERSON>, capital of <LOCATION> Takhar </LOCATION> province east of <LOCATION> Kunduz </LOCATION>. Rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> in the previous two days killed five people and wounded 11, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> denied American charges that departing Soviet forces have left up to 30 million mines behind. `` We would like to state again that we are not involved in any mining,'' he declared. The spokesman said Soviet soldiers have helped Afghans remove and defuse mines planted by guerrillas along major roads. He accused the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of following a `` double standard'' by expressing concern for civilians exposed to mines but not for those killed or wounded by guerrilla rocket attacks on cities. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> accused the Soviets of ignoring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requests for help in removing mines. `` We have contacted the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on several occasions at a high level to request Soviet cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> effort to clear the millions of mines that have been strewn throughout <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been specifically asked to provide maps of mine fields. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> has also been in touch with the Soviet government on this problem. To date we're not aware of any significant Soviet effort to remove mines.'' A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statement issued in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was `` satisfied that the withdrawal of foreign troops has been proceeding in compliance with the fourth instrument of the Geneva Accords.'' <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>'s spokesman, who read the statement at a news briefing, did say how many soldiers had been withdrawn. The statement said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> informed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials May 14 that 100,300 Soviet military personnel were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Western estimates had put the total at 115,000. Fifty unarmed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are charged with monitoring and verifying compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement, including the Soviet withdrawal.

 Officials turned over a Soviet airman to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> on Tuesday, 12 days after he was shot down inside <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the foreign secretary said. <PERSON> Humayun </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> identified the airman as Col. <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Vladimirovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudskoi </PERSON> and said his Su-25 fighter was shot down by a Pakistani F-16 fighter Aug. 4 near the village of <LOCATION> Miranshah </LOCATION>, less than 15 miles from the Afghan border. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> charged <PERSON> Rudskoi </PERSON> was on a combat mission, and the plane was `` fully armed and equipped with cluster bombs.'' He said <PERSON> Rudskoi </PERSON> was captured after he parachuted from the plane. He also alleged that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist government have staged other air raids in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in violation of a U.N.-mediated plan for peace in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. There was no immediate comment from Soviet diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. The foreign secretary said members of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observation witnessed the airman's release to the Soviet Embassy. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> asked the team to look into the incursion into Pakistani airspace. Under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, signed in April, the Soviets said they would pull their troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, 1989. Soviet, Afghan and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said half the troops had been withdrawn by a Monday deadline. Soviet forces intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> says <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a conduit for arms to Afghan guerrillas and allows guerrilla bases on its territory in violation of the pact. <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said the Soviet plane was shot down while Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` I might mention that, in -LRB- that -RRB- meeting, both sides assured the other of their continued compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords.''

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace crusader said Tuesday he is trying to promote direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and has pitched his plan to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> officials. <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who owns a shipboard radio station in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> called The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, is meeting this week with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Jewish leaders in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to present his blueprint. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said he had conceived his plan in the wake of the decision earlier this month by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to relinquish control of the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` Without the Jordanian option, we have a climate in which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must talk to each other,'' he said. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> declined to discuss specifics of his plan but said it would require an `` initial step'' by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and subsequent gestures by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have said they would not talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> until it recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounces terrorism. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said his plan was also based on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> making `` certain gestures proving they can control the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>.'' Earlier in the day, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive panel had approved the establishment of a provisional government in Israeli-occupied territories. <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, also called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to support the formation of an independent Palestinian state. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who flew a light plane from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1966 when the two countries were still at war, said he had asked for a meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and was awaiting a response. He met last week in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> with senior <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials but <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was away at the time, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> added.

Israeli law forbids meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, but <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said no law would stop him from `` crossing borders or talking to people who can bring about peace.'' He said he had `` sent a message with someone'' to the Israeli authorities informing them of his plans to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` They were aware of my plans,'' he said. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said he had met last week in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with officials at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and would remain in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at least another week to seek the support of Jewish leaders.

<TEXT>
 The Nile has risen to its highest level for mid-August and threatens <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, where torrential rains have left up to 1.5 million people homeless, experts said Tuesday. The swollen river runs through the city, still sodden from the deluge Aug. 4-5. More rain fell Tuesday and large areas of the capital are isolated by vast p water and roads that have become impassable tracks of mud. More than 150,000 homes were destroyed and most people in the affected areas have yet to receive aid from a relief operation hampered by bad roads and lack of food and otheools of stagnantr supplies. Inundation by the Nile would worsen the relief problems but officials are uncertain whether it will flood the city. An important factor is whether rains at the Ethiopian headwaters of the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION>, which joins the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nile </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> to form the <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, will further engorge the river. Another source of uncertainty about what awaits <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> stems from ignorance about which parts of the nearly flat city are lowest and thus most vulnerable. British cartographers lent to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> relief operation are working on a contour map of the city that will help determine at what height the Nile waters would start pouring into the streets. The cartographers told reporters and relers on Monday, <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> said. The plateau straddles <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Soviet and international waters, and until now, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> did not allow American scientists to conduct research in the Soviet zone. The plateau measures 250 miles by 60 miles and is part of a longer chain of volcanic islands and submerged seamounts that include <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` It is a continuous trail of volcanic activity that leads 3,500 miles to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, a continuous line of volcanoes,'' <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> said. `` The theories we are testing have to do with what might cause this volcanic activity to start. We know the result, islands like <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>.'' Some recent studies suggest that islands and seamounts were formed when weak spots in the Earth's crust passed over hot volcanic spots. Among the sophisticated hardware aboard the <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> is a high resolution bathymetric survey system known as Sea Beam, made by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instrument </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Sea Beam sends 16 simultaneous sonar signals toward the ocean floor, measures the return time and uses a computer to make an acccurate topographic chart The expedition is also collecting rock samples and cores from the sea floor for later analysis, <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON> said. While the scientific results of the expedition will take weeks or months to analyze, it has already broken diplomatic ground. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, asseerts an economic zone 200 miles off its coasts. But unlike <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> requires foreign scientists to obtain its permission to conduct research in those waters, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Erb </PERSON>, director of maritime sciences at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lonsdale </PERSON>'s expedition marks `` the first time in 10 years that the Soviets have authorized a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research vessel to operate in their economic zone,'' <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> said. The project was made possible by the exchange of diplomatic notes in late 1987 reviving for one year the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Agreement on Cooperation in Studies of the <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, which was signed in 1973 but allowed to lapse. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials will meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> starting Oct. 3 to negotiate three more American expeditions in Soviet waters under the agreement, <PERSON> Erb </PERSON> said. Previously, he said, `` the Soviets had denied us permission and were acting in a way that we felt was not in conformance with the Law of the Sea and normal practice. We raised the issue in bilateral diplomatic conversations,'' but not in an international forum.

<HEAD>Delegates Adopt 1992 Rules After Humphrey Forces Give Up Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Delegates at the Republican National Convention on Tuesday unanimously adopted new rules governing the selection of delegates to the 1992 convention as conservatives decided not to fight a change in the vice presidential nominating process. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and other conservatives had threatened to challenge a rules change allowing the convention to do away with a state-by-state roll call vote on the vice presidential nominee if only one name is placed in nomination. But when <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, the convention's temporary chairman, took a voice vote on the changes, there was no debate and no dissenting votes were heard. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> was not seen on the convention floor. The campaign of Republican nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had requested the change to conserve a half-hour or more of prime-time television time on Thursday night when the convention will nominate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who had demanded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pick a conservative to fill the No. 2 spot on the ticket, said earlier he wanted to block adoption of the rule change so he and others could vote for someone else if they did n't like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection. Aside from the change in the vice presidential nominating process and a few technical changes, the new rules are the same as those passed by the 1984 convention. Republican rules can be changed only by a national convention. Also on Tuesday, the convention adopted the report of the credentials committee, officially allowing the delegates to take their seats. Challenges were settled in meetings last week.

 Advisers to the family of <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> said Tuesday that the 16-year-old girl would refuse to comply if a grand jury subpoenaed her to testify about her charges that she was raped by a gang of white men. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that a grand jury had voted to subpoena the Wappingers Falls teen-ager. Her advisers said Tuesday that they knew of no such subpoena but that she would defy it if it was issued. `` There's no way in heaven, earth or hell we will let <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> participate in the cover-up of what happened to her,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> family adviser. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, a spokesman for state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, said he had no comment and would neither confirm nor deny that a subpoena was voted. The newspaper report said the grand jury acted against the wishes of <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the special prosecutor in charge of investigating Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s allegations. <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and two other family advisers, attorneys <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, maintained that Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> would not give testimony when authorities have no intention of arresting white men whom a black girl identifies as her attackers. They are demanding that <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> be replaced as prosecutor. Earlier, the grand jury sent <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> two letters requesting her testimony, which she ignored. Unlike those letters, a subpoena would carry a threat of jail for non-compliance. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, is facing a 30-day jail term for contempt for defying a subpoena of the grand jury. Police have put off arresting her in circumstances that might lead to dangerous disorder; Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> has remained free by staying in churches or out of the state. Critics have accused the advisers of manipulating Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> to advance their own political agenda. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> disappeared for four days last November and gave only fragmentary statements after she was found smeared with excrement and with racial epithets penned on her body. In charging that the state was running a racially motivated cover-up, the advisers have accused law-enforcement officials of participating in the crime, but have provided no evidence.

 Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hopeful <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> unveiled his first major television ad campaign Tuesday, previewing a spot that will lampoon Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> for running two races at once. Using humorous clips from several old movies, the commercial shows actors trying to ride two horses at the same time, holding up a saddle with no horse under it and falling off a horse into a hole. `` We all wish we had two chances to win. But any real Texan will tell you can get hurt riding more than one horse at a time,'' says the narrator. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was chosen last month as vice presidential running mate by <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Under <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' 1959 `` <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>,'' passed for then Sen. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s name is allowed to appear on the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ballot in both that race and his bid for a fourth <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> began airing his first round of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> election commercials last week. <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> and his campaign manager, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, complain that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and vice presidential campaigns overlap. `` The message that I get from his television commercials ... is the people of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> should elect him to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and then he will resign,'' said <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON>, who is attending the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> National Convention this week. `` Our commercial says that <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> simply does not want to be the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and that <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulter </PERSON> does,'' the <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> congressman said. The commercial narrator's, voice, in a Western twang, also seeks to calls attention to the differences between <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' home state. `` <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> says he's running in two races _ riding a cow pony to impress us back in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and riding sidesaddle for his new <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> friends. Ol' Lloyd is really hedging his bets,'' it says.

<TEXT>
 Bishop College, founded by freed slaves and once the largest black university west of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, has been forced by bankruptcy to shut its doors after 108 years. `` We feel that it's a tragedy that a college that had such great expertise in educating disadvantaged and minority students was not able to survive because there was no money available,'' said <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Schimel </PERSON>, vice president of communications for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. The school's debts increased over the last few years and by April 1987, when it filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, it owed $ 12.6 million to 400 creditors. By Monday, when it filed for Chapter 7 proceedings, the figure had grown to $ 20 million; the school said it was unable to raise the $ 1.85 million needed to keep it opened. Liquidation of the college's assets _ 21 buildings on 400 acres _ will begin as soon as a trustee is appointed. `` I'm personally and professionally hurt,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, a longtime educator and former president of <ORGANIZATION> Huston-Tillotson </ORGANIZATION>, another <PERSON> black </PERSON> college in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, founded in 1881 in the small northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, built its reputation on its graduates _ among them lawyers, teachers, doctors and ministers. The school moved to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1961. At the height of its success, about 1,500 students were enrolled in 1967; last year, that figure had dipped to 300. Scandal rocked the school in the late 1970s when three top administrators were indicted on charges of embezzling student aid funds. Two were acquitted and one was convicted on a misdemeanor charge. Bishop's image never recovered, and neither did its fund-raising efforts. In December 1986, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> lost accreditation from the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colleges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, which in turn forced the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to stop contributing money. Though the school is bankrupt, educators say the need for the college still exists. The dropout rate for blacks is lower at historically <PERSON> black </PERSON> colleges than at other schools, Ms. <PERSON> Schimel </PERSON> said.

 Israeli troops fired on hundreds of rioting Palestinians at a <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> prison camp Tuesday, killing two and wounding a third, the army said. Troops also shot and wounded six Palestinians in scattered clashes in the occupied territories, hospital officials said. A military curfew kept 650,000 Gazans inside their homes for a second straight day. Army officials said dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> also were injured in scuffles with troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, and Arab hospital officials in the seaside strip said they treated 75 people for beating injuries. Rioting erupted in the prison camp at <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION>, about 20 miles southeast of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, after news reached inmates about the curfew and unrest in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said. An army spokesman said troops put down the riot by firing on the Arabs, killing two of them. He said one of those killed was from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the other was from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Yamoun </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The riot broke out in the afternoon and was over by nightfall, he said. Most of the about 2,500 inmates confined at <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> have been jailed for up to six months without trial under special security measures. Human rights groups and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> attorneys have complained of poor food and living conditions at the camp, where inmates are held in a series of tents in the scorching desert heat. The deaths at <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> brought to 247 the number of Arabs killed since the Palestinian rebellion broke out Dec. 8. Four Israelis have died. In another development Tuesday, military officials said troops have begun using a new plastic bullet in the territories which is designed to cause fewer casualties. Introduction of the bullet follows complaints from human rights groups and Palestinians that rubber bullets used previously caused serious injury, including eye loss, and occasionally death. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the new bullet was potentially lethal at a range of under 70 yards. Also Tuesday, a Palestinian from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> died of burns he suffered in a suspected arson attack last week near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Two other Arabs were also killed in the torching, which officials have said might be linked to <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> tensions. The incident prompted widespread rioting in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> over the weekend. In another development, the army said it was removing a colonel from his post as brigade commander because of his involvement in the shooting death of an 18-year-old Palestinian from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <PERSON> Bani </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON>. A military spokesman said the Palestinian, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Maadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaidan </PERSON>, was participating in a violent protest when he was killed April 4. An army investigation determined he was not threatening the soldiers' lives when he was shot. `` It was decided the officer, who was brigade commander and responsible for the chase and the shooting, used bad judgment and will be immediately removed from his position,'' the spokesman said. During clashes with Arab stone-throwers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, soldiers shot and seriously wounded three Palestinians, officials at the city's <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said Troops also shot two refugees at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Nusseirat camp during clashes with curfew violators who hurled rocks at them, officials at the <LOCATION> Ahli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said. Officials at <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said 75 Palestinians were treated for beating injuries on the head, arms and legs that they receievd during pre-dawn house-to-house army searches. Arab sources in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said troops entered homes, beating and clubbing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> youths suspected of breaking the curfew Monday and hurling rocks at soldiers. The curfew was imposed on the entire strip Sunday night after a weekend of violence. During a military curfew residents are forbidden to leaving their homes. Gazans reached by telephone Tuesday said the curfew was not being strictly enforced. `` People go out and walk around. Especially children are running and playing until they see soldiers, then they hide. In my neighborhood, some shops are even open, doing business from the back doors,'' said <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Murtaja </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, 21,350 Palestinians stopped receiving salaries from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as part of a move by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to cut ties with Arabs in the territories. About 5,200 employees were laid off. Another 16,150 people employed in the health, education and agriculture sectors will continue in their jobs receiving salaries only from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Yassir </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, director of the Jordanian-run <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't choose his vice presidential running mate until almost the last minute, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> conducted a long, boring search, and <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> declined to choose at all. They all did it their way and so did <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to keep everybody guessing _ until Tuesday afternoon _ was the No. 2 topic at the Republican National Convention, which had little else to talk about. No. 1, of course, was the choice itself. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> brought all that speculation to an abrupt end Tuesday afternoon with his announcement that he had selected Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as his running mate. In holding his cards close to his vest, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was only doing unto others what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did to him. All evening, on Wednesday of 1980 Republican Convention week in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, it looked as if former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> would be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s choice for vice president. The way <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> saw it, if they won they would have sort of a shared presidency. But at 11:15 p.m. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> agreed not to be a team and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received a telephone call. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalls in his autobiography, the conversation went like this: `` Hello, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, this is <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. I'd like to go over to the convention and announce that you're my choice for vice president if that's all right with you.'' `` I'd be honored, Governor.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> is there anything at all ... about the platform or anything else, anything that might make you uncomfortable down the road.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could think of nothing. A few minutes after midnight, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made an unusual trip to convention hall to announced his choice, a dramatic end to a dramatic night of speculation and rumor. Despite the long list of vice presidential hopefuls that came to be interviewed in <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> in 1976, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> did n't announce his choice of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> until Thursday, the day the vice presidential nomination went before the delegates. The fact that both tickets with last minute running mate choices won probably had n't escaped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The fact that <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> picked <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> in advance in 1984 _ and they lost the election _ might also have made an impression. The choice of a running mate is probably the most important early decision a presidential candidate makes. Thirteen vice presidents have become president, eight on the death of a president. In 1956, Democratic nominee <PERSON> Adlai </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> startled the convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by leaving the choice of his running mate to the delegates. As a result, votes were distributed among 13 candidates after the first ballot. Sen. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> <PERSON> Kefauver </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> had 483 -LCB- votes, followed by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> with 304 and Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> with 178. On the second ballot, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had the lead after the roll call, but before the chair recognized vote changes. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> pulled out, began a bandwagon for <PERSON> Kefauver </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> moved that <PERSON> Kefauver </PERSON>'s nomination be made unanimous The ticket lost. With that exception, every vice presidential nominee in modern times has been the presidential nominee's choice _ albeit an uneasy choice, sometimes. In 1944, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> did n't want to run with Vice President <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> but had no other favorite. He was persuaded to accept <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>, who then succeeded him 82 days after the inauguration when <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> died. In 1960, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> offered the No. 2 spot to <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, thinking that his chief opponent for the presidential nomination would not accept. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> did, helped <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> win by bringing in Southern states, and became president when JFK was assassinated in 1963. When <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ran for president in 1964, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> picked Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> as a teammate, saying `` one of the reasons I chose <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is that he drives <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> nuts.''

 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Ramrod and Rainbow in the Secret Service code book, saw their fortunes as the vice presidential twins of the Republican National Convention rise together and fall together. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader and his wife, the former secretary of transportation, have earned a unique footnote in American political history. The Doles got word Tuesday that they were out of the running for the No. 2 spot _ although <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was told he had been one of two finalists. A short time later, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced he had selected Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to be his running mate. They were almost certainly the first married couple to be considered individually for a vice presidential nomination. They joke about their situation. They joke about it a lot. `` I'm not running for vice president,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said this week. `` I'm not campaigning for anyone. But she would make a great vice president.'' Or: `` We're not running. But when the phone rings, she says, ` Let me get it.''' Or: `` If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls, the man _ or woman _ who picks up the phone will say, ` I take it,' and hang up fast.'' `` It is a bit of a novelty to have a husband and wife under consideration as running mates,'' <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said as convention week opened. `` But I truly mean it when I say I'm not running for it and neither is <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>.'' She said she was more worried about her job as the GOP convention's temporary chairman. `` That gavel is so big I understand it may take two hands to handle it.'' The Doles are one of the capital's power couples, a fact the senator likes to capitalize on. At the 1983 Gridiron Dinner given by the nation's press, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> told the audience: `` I'm happy to be here with the country's second most powerful couple _ <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.'' A favorite line: `` She has her career and I have my career and we have our career _ whatever that is.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> often can not control an urge to take a playful swipe at her politician husband. At a publisher's convention a few years ago she explained her commitment to air bags in automobiles saying, `` I ought to know, I married one.'' `` The Doles are a hell of a one-two punch. ...,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's like adding two and two and getting five.'' Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is notorious in the world of politics for his dark humor and his biting tongue. With an occasional lapse he has tried to curb that tongue in recent years, especially since his marriage. `` According to popular theory, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> was responsible for my sudden mellowing,'' he says. The Doles penned a book issued earlier this year. Their subject was themselves. The title: `` The Doles, Unlimited Partners.'' They used it to sketch the outlines of their lives and to define themselves as public figures in the late 20th century. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> credited his wife for helping to broaden his outlook but said she was n't the only influence. `` With all due respects to <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, it would be unusual if age and experience had n't broadened my perspective,'' he wrote. `` In truth, most of those who talked about a new <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had n't known the old one very well. What had changed was not my character or personality but my role in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where success is impossible to achieve unless you have the votes on your side.'' The Doles have figured in vice presidential speculation for years. Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, of course, actually ran for vice president as President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s running mate in 1976. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was once asked if her husband could adjust to actually being No. 2 to a sitting president. She said he could. But <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was n't so sure about becoming No. 2. `` One and a half maybe,'' he said.

 The city has offered a $ 17,312 settlement to pay a blind woman for her humiliation after she was forced by a policeman to clean up after her guide dog. <PERSON> Raygena </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, a 25-year-old stockbroker, sued the city over the September 1985 incident. She said she would accept the settlement offer from the city attorney's office, which also must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION>. `` The reason I will settle for this amount is that it has been going on since 1985,'' she said. `` I'd prefer to go to trial because I would win hands down. It is n't the money ... they could pay me $ 500,000 and it would n't be enough for what they did.'' The officer, <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a 22-year police veteran, said, `` I was just doing my job.'' `` I did n't know she was blind and that it was a guide dog,'' he said. <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> stopped <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> as she was walking to lunch with some co-workers and friends, accompanied by her guide dog, <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>. She said in her lawsuit that the dog indicated it needed to defecate, so she led it to the gutter next to the curb. Moments later, she said, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> walked up and ordered her to clean up after the dog in accordance with the city's `` pooper-scooper'' law that requires pet-owners to dispose of an animal's waste <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said she protested that she was blind and that owners of guide dogs are exempt from that ordinance. This was confirmed by City Attorney <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Renne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said she became `` increasingly distressed and humiliated as a large crowd gathered,'' and that despite her repeated protestations, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> forced her `` to clean up after -LRB- her -RRB- dog with a paper tissue, insert the waste into a paper bag and travel across the street to deposit the bag in a garbage receptacle.'' Although <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> claimed he did n't know <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> was blind, she said: `` I told him more than five times. I'm a very aware individual, considering that I'm blind. I know the laws and my rights, but he would not relent.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, who said he suffers high blood pressure and went on unpaid sick leave in 1986, said he had n't realized then that blind people using guide dogs are exempt from the pooper-scooper law. `` No, I did n't have that knowledge at the time. I learned it later. This is blown all out of proportion. I had no knowledge at the time that she even was blind, and no one came forward to say she was blind.''

 American factories, mines and utilities operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in July, the highest operating level in eight years, the government reported Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said the operating rate climbed a sharp 0.4 percentage point last month and now stands 2.4 percentage points higher than it was a year ago as American manufacturers continued to benefit from a boom in export sales. The government said in a separate report Tuesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit rose sharply to $ 12.5 billion in June even though exports remained close to their record highs set earlier this year. It was the fourth consecutive monthly increase in the industrial operating rate and put it at its highest level since March 1980, when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry was operating at 83.7 percent of capacity. The increase was further evidence that inflationary pressures are building in the economy, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s top policymakers met behind closed doors Tuesday to review monetary strategy. A week ago, the central bank boosted a key lending rate as a way of trying to dampen inflationary pressures. It hiked its discount rate, the fee it charges on loans to member banks, from 6 percent to 6.5 percent. Analysts predicted further less dramatic credit tightening in the weeks ahead as the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> makes further efforts to dampen demand and ease pressures on tight labor markets and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industries already operating at high levels. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has put out the message that it is time to put on the brakes,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said the overall operating rate is still below traditional peaks at the end of expansionary periods of around 87 percent. But he said at the rate manufacturing has expanded in the past year, the country will be closing in on that top level in the next year. Some industries, in fact, are already above those levels, with paper plants operating at 92.8 percent of capacity and textile mills at 89.6 percent of capacity. The operating rate at all manufacturing plants climbed to 83.7 percent of capacity, up from 83.2 percent in June. This compared with an average over the past 20 years of 80.6 percent and a low in the 1981-82 recession of 68 percent. Factories making durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, saw their operating rate rise to 82.3 percent of capacity from 81.7 percent in June. The increase came even though the operating rate at auto plants dipped to 71.4 percent of capacity from 75.3 percent in May. Plants producing non-durable goods saw the operating rate rise to 85.8 percent from 85.4 percent. The mining sector, which includes oil and gas well drilling, had an increase to 82.3 percent from 81.7 percent in June. The nation's utilities, which have been working to meet increased air conditioning demands prompted by the summer heat wave, operated at 84.2 percent of capacity in July, up from 83.4 percent in June.

 In this city where revelry is routine and sensuality is as palpable as the pungent aroma of Cajun spices, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s conservative, mostly Mormon <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegation has found little to remind it of home. If the state settled by <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>'s pioneers has an opposite, this is the place. When other delegates to the Republican National Convention head for <ORGANIZATION> Bourbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>'s bars after the nightly floor sessions, the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> delegation offers a `` nightcap'' of ice cream flown in by delegate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelgrove </PERSON>, part-owner of <ORGANIZATION> Snelgrove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> And by Tuesday, only a few cans were missing from two cases of Dixie brand beer delivered as a courtesy to the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> hospitality room. At least 20 of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s 26 delegates identify themselves as members of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which discourages the use of alcohol, tobacco, coffee and tea. But <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> leads the nation in per capita consumption of ice cream. Ice cream is sold in the French Quarter, too, but it is not a goal of most of the people strolling the narrow streets. The principal attraction is the irreverent celebration that begins at sundown and does n't stop until almost dawn. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> the sale of mixed drinks is banned except in private clubs, but they can be purchased to go in open-front bars along <LOCATION> Bourbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> law forbids nude dancing, but in the Quarter's burlesque clubs, dancers ply their trade, up to a point, before open doors Among the temptations are the blackened redfish, jambalaya, gumbo and other Cajun dishes offered by the city's scores of restaurants. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, a delegate from <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON> who has been to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> before, warned dieting delegates at their first meeting. `` You've got to treat this like a <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> convention,'' he said. `` You've got to think, frankly, you do n't give a damn, and eat. This is a 20-pound convention.''

 Several hundred people remained at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neumann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday to pray and share accounts of the miracles they claimed to have witnessed the night before. While about 50 people lined up inside the darkened sanctuary to pray and leave flowers before a small statue of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, others gathered in small groups in the courtyard outside to talk about what they had seen during Monday's evening Mass. One woman stopped by the fountain to dip her rosary beads in the water. Thousands of worshipers interrupted the outdoor service early Monday evening with cries and applause as hundreds claimed to see <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> when a ray of light burst through the clouds. Some worshipers said the sun appeared to dance in the sky, while dozens reported that the silver beads on their rosaries turned to a gold color. Others in the crowd, including several priests, said they saw nothing in the sky but the sun and clouds, but the pastor of the church said it looked to him like `` a host spinning inside the sun.'' <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffner </PERSON> showed three photographs of the sky she had taken Monday. In one photo, amid the clouds and rays of sunlight, a faint line was visible, and Mrs. <PERSON> Shaffner </PERSON> said she perceived a window frame in that picture. `` I took these in sequence,'' she said. `` The sun looked blue. It kind of danced. It did it three times, like the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shaffner </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blood </PERSON>, said the silver-colored crucifix on her chain of rosary beads turned gold. `` This belonged to my father and I've had it for all these years,'' she said. `` I never thought this would happen.'' About 12,000 people came to St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, a charismatic church, after three parishioners reported receiving messages from the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. `` I will look upon you and you will see my eyes,'' one reported message said. Other messages told the parish to prepare for miracles on Monday's Feast of the Assumption, which celebrates the entry of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> into Heaven after her death. Reports of phenomena similar to those reported Monday have been received from pilgrims to <LOCATION> Medjugorje </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. In that small, mountain village, six youths have claimed to have received messages and seen apparitions of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>. Neither the reported occurrences in <LOCATION> Yugloslavia </LOCATION> nor at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> have been officially endorsed or recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. After the first messages were reported, Bishop <PERSON> Micheal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diocese </LOCATION> had urged worshipers to treat the messages with caution. He was out of town Tuesday and not available for comment on Monday's reports, his office said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister and militant member of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should annex parts of the occupied Palestinian territories immediately. The rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> announced changes in its election platform to emphasize peace talks with Palestinians rather than negotiations led by <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> that would include Palestinians. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> announced a decision two weeks ago to cut most of his legal, administrative and economic ties with the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s monarch said indirectly it was up to the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to determine the future of any peace negotiations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, which had sought talks with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation that would not include representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, the trade and industry minister, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> the time was right for annexation because <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s actions dissolved proposed peace negotiations `` This may be the last moment to take security steps,'' he said, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should move quickly before the `` psychological, political vacuum'' created by <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s decision is filled, presumably by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> appeared ready to declare an independent state in the occupied territories, which would create `` strong international opposition -LRB- to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> annexation -RRB-. Today it's still possible.'' During a weekend meeting in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and Jordanian delegations, the possibility of creating a `` provisional Palestinian government'' in the territories was discussed, according to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sources. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> said: `` There already is a Palestinian state. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is the Palestinian state.'' A group of people from the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated outside the building where <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> held the news conference. One banner said, `` From the architect of the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> war to the architect of annexation.'' <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> was defense minister when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in June 1962. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> withdrew the bulk of its forces three years later. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders debated the party's platform for November's national elections and approved changes on possible peace talks The changes must be ratified by two higher party organizations. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> said that under the proposed platform, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> would strive for peace talks with <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in accordance with its policy of talking to a joint Palestinian-Jordanian delegation. But `` Labor also will be ready to talk to Palestinian elements and personalities who recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, renounce terror'' and accept <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions recognizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, the new platform plank said, according to <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION>. It said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would talk with `` agreed representatives of the people of the territories, even if <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would not take part in the negotiations.'' Both <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor have refused to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, describing it is a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. They have been in a fractious coalition since 1984 elections in which neither won a parliamentary majority.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tapped youthful, conservative Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> on Tuesday to be his Republican running mate. `` I do not intend to fail'' in the quest for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the vice president vowed as he arrived to claim his party's presidential nomination `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s a man of the future,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said as he introduced his fair-haired running mate at an outdoor campaign rally on the banks of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. In his first utterance as a national candidate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his confidence and immediately showed off the exuberance he will bring to the ticket in the uphill race against the Democrats this fall. `` Let's go get'em!'' he shouted. `` We will win because <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not afford to lose,'' said the 41-year-old senator. `` There is nothing more important in this country than freedom, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will keep the freedom and peace.'' Said an obviously delighted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` Well done, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON>.'' Republican National Convention delegates were settling in for an evening of speechmaking from the likes of former President <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> and keynoter Gov. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. But barring a late night visit by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to the Superdome podium, it was a safe bet that the day's drama was elsewhere <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of a running mate was part of an attempt by his high command to depict the vice president as the new, undisputed leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In a carefully scripted changing of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> guard, he flew to the convention city and strolled across a windy tarmac to bid `` hail and farewell'' to a departing President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection drew raves from party leaders, although <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> admitted to being `` a little disappointed'' at being passed over. Arizona Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said his congressional colleague is `` extremely telegenic in this day of television and images.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a second-term senator from a reliably Republican state, won his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in the 1980 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslide. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection would make no difference in the Democratic strategy `` We have always promised and will continue to run a 50-state national campaign, and this will not sizeably affect our campaign effort at all,'' he said. But Republican strategists said otherwise. Campaign adviser <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` should give us a chance to appeal to baby boom voters'' and strengthen <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> appeal in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. The choice of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator was something of a surprise, although he had long been rumored to be under consideration and had made clear his interest in joining the ticket. In turning to the telegenic Midwesterner, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bypassed better known conservatives such as Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, and durable party stalwarts such as Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Chief of Staff <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> he'd been the other finalist, according to an aide to the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> senator. Standing in shirtsleeves at the outdoor celebration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared, `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s a man of the future, a young man, a young man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He's a dynamic young leader for the future of our party.'' The audience roared its approval.

 <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> fans lined up to visit the singer's grave on the 11th anniversary of his death Tuesday, undismayed by heat in the high 90s or a new book that has set off a wave of jokes about their idol. The book `` Is Elvis Alive?'' disputes that he died of heart disease Aug. 16, 1977, at his Graceland mansion. But there was no question Tuesday as fans and other tourists came to visit the estate and pay their respects. More than 70 stands of flowers, many shaped like guitars or hearts, lined the walk to Presley's grave. A vigil and candlelight graveside procession on the eve of the anniversary attracted 3,000 people, according to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> police. `` This is the next best thing we're going to get to seeing <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fan who traveled from <LOCATION> Leeds </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. `` It's too simple to say we just liked his music. It's much more than that,'' <PERSON> Knowles </PERSON> said. `` It's more of a respect and admiration. He's admired as a human being.'' Organizers of a nine-day celebration called `` Elvis International Tribute Week'' said the latest <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> book upset and offended fans by its claims and the jokes and speculation it has prompted. But fans appeared to be taking it in stride. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Loper </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> fan club leader from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said many fans plan to simply ignore it. `` In the fan club newsletters I've read, everybody is putting it down and laughing about it,'' she said. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carothers </PERSON>, an Elvis-look-alike fan from <LOCATION> Gnadenhutten </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said he was keeping on guard just in case <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> did show up. `` You never know,'' he said. The anniversary crowd, though about equal in size to previous years, was noticeably smaller than last year's 10th anniversary, which drew record numbers of believers, reporters and photographers. Graceland draws 600,000 visitors a year and 3,500 to 4,000 tourists go through the house on any typical summer day. The anniversary of the singer's death draws some of the most devoted fans, however, and <PERSON> Graceland </PERSON> managers organize musical shows, a memorial, trivia contest, a foot race and other events.

 Spending six months in a sweltering prison cell still has n't soured <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, although the native Texan said Tuesday his only crime was having homemade hooch in his home. `` I'd go back tomorrow. I have no animosity towards those people,'' said <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, a 52-year-old oil engineer. `` They've got their set of rules and they play by a different set of rules than us.'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> and 45-year-old <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillette </PERSON>, also an oil engineer, flew from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Tuesday after their release. <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, who lost 32 pounds during his six months in a hot tin and concrete prison, and <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> were pardoned by the Emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, reportedly after intervention by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` When they came to my cell, I thought they were joking,'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> said in his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hotel room after a reunion with his wife, <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>, and a former employer, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who worked to free them. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, who has high blood pressure and a heart condition, rested in another room after a reunion with his wife, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> helped free the men by persuading <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s Crown Prince <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saad </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> to ask Emir <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabeh </PERSON> to pardon them `` If they want to know where <PERSON> George </PERSON> was, we know where he was,'' said <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, referring to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s mocking refrain of `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>? at July's Democratic presidential convention. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> declined to provide information on the case. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> shared an apartment in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, where they work for the international oil well servicing company <ORGANIZATION> Anadrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schlumberger </ORGANIZATION>. They were sentenced in March to five years in prison each on charges of selling homemade whiskey. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a Moslem country, forbids the sale or production of liquor. <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> said he and <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION>, like many foreigners, kept homemade wine and beer in their home. He said he believes an employee may have sold some of his liquor while <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> was away on a leave of absence last fall. In May, an appeals court reduced their sentences to three years and four months. `` You've got to develop a mental attitude or you'll go crazy, and I chose the other way,'' said <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Kilgore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` My wife and I sat down and decided that if I had to spend three years and four months in jail, so be it.'' <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> shared a cell with five other prisoners, slept on the floor rather than on the concrete slab that was his bed `` because it was cooler,'' painted prison signs, read a lot and looked forward to at least twice-weekly visits from his wife. <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> spent his time in a prison hospital. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> said she was occasionally allowed to bring her husband mustard and other treats. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oilfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of Daventry, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, said he informed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of the case through <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s longtime associate, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The Gillettes, of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, plan to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Thursday, said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Gilleys </PERSON> said they will visit <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in a couple of weeks. After that, <PERSON> Gilley </PERSON> will decide what to do. `` I know one thing.

 An artist who says she was `` bothered a lot'' hopes to tame the animal instincts of the urban jungle's aggressive men by posting a few more signs along the city's streets. <PERSON> Ilona </PERSON> <PERSON> Granet </PERSON>'s 2-foot-square metal and enamel designs _ one in pink, the other magenta _ urge men who must leer to do so in silence. One shows a shapely woman admonishing a tom cat truck driver: `` No Cat Calls _ Whistling -LRB- or -RRB- Kissing Sounds.'' The other, illustrated with a man restraining a struggling wolf, advises in English and Spanish: `` Curb Your Animal Instinct.'' The eye-catching signs `` came to be because I was bothered a lot. Every girl I know was bothered a lot,'' Ms. <PERSON> Granet </PERSON>, a believer in art with a social message, said Tuesday. Later this week, in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> near City Hall and in the financial district, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> artist says she will begin putting up `` 12 little signs which are going to change mankind so everyone will be gentlemen and ladies again.'' <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> DOT </ORGANIZATION> had granted permission for Ms. <PERSON> Granet </PERSON> to hang the signs for six months `` as works of art at the request of a community board and an arts group.'' But he said that if the works create confusion with existing street signs, `` I see a clash between the artist and the bureaucracy.'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, whose department maintains and regulates the city's million or so street signs, views Mr. <PERSON> Granet </PERSON>'s efforts as an ineffective `` publicity stunt. `` A sign telling a wolf not to whistle is like putting a red flag in front of a bull and telling him to cease and desist from charging. It does n't work,'' <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. Although the artist agrees that her signs will do little to change attitudes, she hopes they will become part of a dialogue between men and women. `` It can be a real problem that men do n't get. A lot of men think it's complimentary,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Granet </PERSON>, 39. `` For young girls it can be traumatic,'' she said of obscene propositions some men make to passing women. `` It's way too personal and it's kind of frightening. `` As an older woman I'm not frightened by these people, but I am offended. When you're unprepared for it, it's a horrible intrusion.'' Ms. <PERSON> Granet </PERSON> has so far asked five <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> community boards for permission to post signs. One has agreed, one is still considering it and the other three refused. She said she has invested about $ 3,500 _ some from an arts grant and some of her own money _ to print 100 of her signs. She said she plans to post 50 around the city and hopes to sell the others. `` There was going to be a line -LRB- of signs -RRB- for the beach this summer, but they became poisonous and I canceled it,'' she added. Floating medical waste and sewage have closed many of the area's beaches this summer

 More <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> Tuesday to prepare for the cease-fire scheduled to begin Saturday in the 8-year-old war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, sent a cable to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> saying <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> may attack before the truce. The head of Iranian volunteer units said 130,000 government employees had gone to the front in case of an assault. Kurdish guerrillas backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> said they had killed 500 Iraqi soldiers in several days of battle in the northwestern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> region and fighting continued. <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the 73 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers joined several who arrived last week. About the same number of observers are in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. They are part of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> _ 350 unarmed officers from 24 nations who will have headquarters in the two capitals and monitor the cease-fire. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was flying Canadian members of the observer group to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> but would not land in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Slavko </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, chief of the observer corps, was due in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the Iraqi agency said. <PERSON> Jovic </PERSON> will shuttle between <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. Assessments are to be levied on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> members to pay the $ 74 million the observer force will cost for the six months authorized by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Of the total, $ 47 million is for start-up expenses. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio quoted <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> as telling the secretary-general: `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> intends to launch a series of military operations in the air, on land and at sea, before the cease-fire.'' `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has accepted the request of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general and the president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to refrain from military operations, wheras <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has not only refused to respond to this request but has resorted to aggression against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> was quoted as saying. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s regime announced last month that it accepted the year-old <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Resolution 598, which calls for a cease-fire, withdrawal to recognized borders, prisoner exchange, peace talks and an investigation of which side started the war. Each side has accused the other of violating an informal truce that began earlier this month. The head of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pasdaran </ORGANIZATION>, or volunteer units, said troops at the front should be bolstered against possible <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> attack, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio reported. `` In this regard, 130,000 government employees have been dispatched to the war fronts, where they can give deadly strokes to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces,'' said the official, identified only as Mr. <PERSON> Rahmani </PERSON>. He did not say when the reinforcements were sent, but it appeared his reference was to the period since <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> accepted the resolution on July 18. The Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla group fighting for the independence of <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>, said fighting began Aug. 12. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> did not comment on the report. In a telex from their <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> office, the Kurds said the fighting was in the area where the frontiers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> meet. They said the Iraqis attacked with planes, helicopter gunships and chemical weapons. `` The offensive was halted and our guerrillas counterattacked and drove the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops back to their starting point,'' the statement said, and gave the Kurds' losses as 54 killed and wounded. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> supports the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, and other Kurdish separatist groups in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Kurds have fought for decades to establish an independent nation in their mountainous homeland, now divided among <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, celebrated winning a $ 26 million Lotto jackpot with white grape juice Tuesday; they did n't need the champagne. `` If people say they get high on marijuana, then they ought to win the lottery,'' <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON>, 51, a building maintenance man for a bus company, told reporters a few hours after the winning ticket was validated. The Brandon couple will receive $ 1.3 million a year for the next 20 years. That will leave them with about $ 940,000 after taxes, according to their accountant, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphreys </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> and his wife, a clerk with the <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> tax collector, bought the ticket the day before the Aug. 6 drawing. The ticket was one of 40 they purchased and stacked on the family Bible. The winning chit was on the bottom of the pile. `` It was the last ticket I read, next to the Bible,'' <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> said. `` So I'd advise everybody to say your prayers. You do n't win it just on picking the numbers.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON>, 50, said she and her husband waited 10 days to come forward in order to take care of home-security matters, talk to their accountant and make out a will. `` We're going to relax, that's for sure, because we both worked hard throughout life. We've had a lot of ups and downs,'' <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> said. He and his wife, who have three grown children, would probably do some traveling, he said. Both plan to quit their jobs. `` We'll ... generally try to enjoy life and see what the world is all about.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davidheiser </PERSON> said the winning ticket was hers but that she would split it with her husband. The couple, who moved to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, have been married for 11 years. Although the two of them together usually buy $ 10 worth of Lotto tickets a week, they decided to splurge and spend $ 20 each as the jackpot climbed past $ 20 million for the Aug. 6 drawing. The prize is the 13th largest lottery prize awarded in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this year, a $ 51.4 million prize in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was split between two winners. Last year, a single winner in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> won $ 46 million.

 Bigfoot, a legend whose large footprints and reported sightings have inspired storytellers for years, now has a first name: <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last week selected `` Harrison Bigfoot'' as mascot of the state's 100th anniversary celebration. His first name comes from <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who was president when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> became the 42nd state in 1889. According to legend, Bigfoot, sometimes called <PERSON> Sasquatch </PERSON>, roams the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> woods as a sub-Arctic version of the abominable snowman.

The <ORGANIZATION> Centennial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> plans to choose a person to wear a Bigfoot costume at Centennial events that begin Nov. 11. `` We're looking for a very friendly Bigfoot, an actor who will portray an attractive representative of our centennial,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brush </PERSON> said. There are no height or shoe size requirements for the role, she said.

 A 12-foot python that was unclaimed after it was captured by police is city property now and will be sold to the highest, and perhaps the bravest, bidder. No one has been able to determine the owner of the snake, which was found Aug. 3 in someone's yard. It took three police officers to pry the non-poisonous snake from a tree it had wrapped itself around. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shelter </ORGANIZATION>, said that because the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> python is city property now, he must follow bidding procedures for the sale of the snake. The process will begin after a curator at the Baltimore Zoo examines the snake to determine its sex and assess its health. Bids could go as high as $ 50 to $ 100, <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said. The snake is resting peacefully at the shelter.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Up 28.5 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened to $ 12.5 billion in June as imports hit an all-time high, the government said Tuesday. Analysts said the report showed how far the country still has to go in solving its trade problems. The gap between what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> exports and what the country imports surged by 28.5 percent in June, a major setback after three consecutive monthly improvements. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought to play down the significance of the one-month surge, but Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the figures were evidence of the administration's failed economic policies. Financial markets, which went into a tailspin the last time such a disappointing trade report was released, took Tuesday's report more or less in stride. While the dollar was hit by a wave of panic selling immediately after the report was released, it soon steadied and regained much of its lost ground. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had plunged 100 points after the last disappointing trade figure was released in April, posted gains after the June figure was released. The average of 30 industrial stocks advanced by more than 17 points to close at 2,021.51, after falling on Monday to its lowest close in nearly three months. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration contended the June deficit was a one-month aberration that did nothing to change the fact that the country will enjoy a substantial narrowing of its merchandise trade deficit in 1988, the first such improvement in eight years. Even with the June bulge, the deficit for the first six months of the year was running at an annual rate of $ 140 billion, down significantly from the record $ 170.3 billion deficit set in 1987. `` The rise in the trade deficit is a disappointment, but it does not change the fact that our underlying fundamentals are improving,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The June surge in the trade deficit followed a revised May imbalance of $ 9.8 billion, the lowest monthly deficit since December 1984. The $ 2.8 billion deterioration came from a 2.4 percent drop in exports and a 5.7 percent rise in imports, which climbed to a record high of $ 39.4 billion. Even with the small dip in exports, they still totaled $ 26.8 billion, the third highest monthly sales figure on record. Analysts said this reflected continued strong demand for American manufactured goods, which have benefitted from the weaker dollar. In a separate report Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said that American industry operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in July, the highest operating rate in more than eight years. The 0.4 percentage point rise from the June level reflected widespread gains in many industrial sectors, helped in large part by the export boom, analysts said. However, the trade report showed that imports were flooding into the country in record amounts even though the dollar has lost more than 50 percent of its value against the Japanese yen and German mark over the past three years, a development which the administration hoped would make many foreign goods too expensive for American pocketbooks. Paradoxically, analysts said one reason for the surge in imports was the fact that the overall economy was robust in the second quarter, with both consumer spending and business investment up sharply. The problem, however, was that much of that spending still went for imports. `` The June trade deficit tells a very disappointing story,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The trade deficit ca n't really be cracked until American businesses and consumers stop buying so many imports.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, blamed the administration's economic policies, in particular the huge budget deficits which have increased the country's need for foreign capital. `` This is a nation that eight years ago was the largest creditor nation in the world. Today we are the largest debtor nation in the world,'' he said. `` That's the consequence of eight years of borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending.'' The jump in imports in June came from big increases in purchases of clothing and cars by consumers and a $ 900 million rise in purchases of capital equipment by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said that while American manufacturers have been spending heavily to expand production facilities, much of the money has gone to buy foreign equipment. `` In industries like paper and textiles, American companies are putting in foreign machinery because that is where the state of the art is,'' he said. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign oil bill declined slightly in June to $ 3.6 billion, compared to $ 3.9 billion in May, as the average price per barrel fell to $ 16.19, down 21 cents from May. As usual, the largest overall deficit was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 4.4 billion, up from $ 4.1 billion in May. The deficit with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> climbed to $ 1.40 billion; with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it rose to $ 1.9 billion; with the newly industrialized countries of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> the deficit rose to $ 2.7 billion in June.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have established a joint military commission to monitor the week-old truce in the Angolan war, the government announced Tuesday. The South African <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the three countries, which agreed to a cease-fire Aug. 8, met Monday and Tuesday in army tents at <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION>, on the border of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, to work out details of the monitoring group. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monitoring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> will include officers from the three countries and also from the Namibian military. In <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, the Namibian capital, the territorial army that is controlled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> said its forces killed 14 guerrillas last week. The Aug. 8 cease-fire does not apply to hostilities in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has administered <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since the end of World War I under a mandate from the now-defunct League of Nation. That mandate was repudiated in 1966 by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which called for elections and independence for the territory between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Black nationalist guerrillas of the <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> Peoples' Organization, or <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION>, have been battling <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for years for control of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it would not agree to independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as long as an estimated 50,000 Cuban soldiers remain in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, helping the Marxist government battle guerrillas backed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The brief statement from the South African <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Ruacana </LOCATION> talks were held `` in a climate of respect and responsibility,'' but gave no details of how the monitoring commission would operate. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it is complying with the first phase of the cease-fire plan that calls for it to withdraw an estimated 2,500 South African troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> by Sept. 1. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also has said it is willing to begin withdrawing from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by Nov. 1 if it can reach a mutual date for Namibian independence and the withdrawal of the Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> along with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediators plan a new round of peace talks next week in an effort to establish that timetable. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1974 and Marxist forces defeated pro-Western factions in the civil war that followed. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> sent troops to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to help the government battle guerrillas of <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which was left out of the peace talks, has said its guerrillas will continue fighting until it is included in negotiations. The <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION> report on last week's fighting in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> gave no details. It was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, commanded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION>, and also said 275 <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas have been killed this year.

 Parties are swinging to Dixieland and Cajun waltzes during the Republican National Convention, a four-day nonstop dance of unity that's keeping musicians busy around the clock. There's jazz at brunch, and two-steps by night. And there's all-day hometown hubris: `` These four days do n't come close to <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, secretary of the 1,300-member <ORGANIZATION> Musicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 174-496 `` But there does seem to be a little more publicity and the parties are more numerous,'' <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> concedes. Dixieland music welcomed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to a street party on the river front Tuesday afternoon. As the paddlewheeler <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION> eased to the dock along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Re-Birth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jazz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> let loose with `` When the Saints Go Marching In.'' Their rowdy music was punctuated by a shrill blast from the calliope aboard the riverboat, which carried <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and hundreds of supporters to the rally. The rally's Dixieland theme was typical of live music that is entertaining Republicans this week. An extravagant party just is n't complete, it seems, without live tunes And everybody, it seems, wants to be extravagant. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said his 10-piece band, featuring four vocalists, has turned down some invitations to entertain during the convention. He accepted one from the Republican Senatorial Inner Circle, big-money boosters of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates. `` We'll play all kinds of selections,'' he said. Can delegates get burned out on Dixieland? `` It depends on the individual. Some will listen to only that,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a popular local pianist, has also been able to pick his party stops, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Menteris </PERSON>. Cole entertained at a delegate welcoming party in Audubon Zoo and for a function honoring President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But he turned down twice as many chances to play as he accepted, she said. `` The workload has picked up,'' Ms. <PERSON> Menteris </PERSON> said. `` I would be surprised if there are any musicians who have n't worked.'' But at least one performance missed most of its expected audience. Legendary trumpeter <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON> started a three-night engagement at a club Monday, but drew only 50 fans. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, manager of the club, located in the new Riverwalk development, blamed a late-running opening convention session and heavy traffic in the Big Easy. `` I'm absolutely disappointed,'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON> was the consummate showman. Natty in red bow tie and matching handkerchief, he growled, `` You're a small crowd, but you're enthusiastic, and that's where it's at.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegate <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> was delighted. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> resident first heard <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> while traveling up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> as a serviceman during the Korean War. `` I think they could have done a better job of advertising this. I did n't know <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON> was here until I just happened to have it mentioned to me I love his music,'' <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> said. Delegate <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, praised <PERSON> Hirt </PERSON>'s showmanship. `` He's a classic,'' she said.

 Union officials said Tuesday the government is investigating complaints that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers have held British workers at gunpoint on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> headquarters called the charges `` totally false.'' The British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it was looking into one alleged incident. Three unions representing civil servants who work at the bases said they had complained to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and to the <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which builds and services the facilities. The 90,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Servants </ORGANIZATION> said incidents date back to 1980. Institute spokeswoman <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> said an engineer who had been refused entry to <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heyford </LOCATION> base northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday got in on a second try, then was chased by a soldier who shouted `` Halt or I'll fire!'' and made to lie on the ground for an hour at gunpoint until his identity was confirmed. Ms. <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> said incidents have occurred at bases in <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heyford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lakenheath </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alconbury </LOCATION>. She said such treatment was not `` an automatic way of behavior... but what we want is that -LRB- <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers -RRB- have a clear understanding of how they should behave and what our people should do. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the ministry was investigating an `` alleged incident'' involving a maintenance man but had no record of other complaints. Master Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> headquarters said: `` Allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> employees have been held at gunpoint or shot at by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> security personnel are totally false. `` There was an incident involving a PSA employee attempting to enter a secure area of <ORGANIZATION> RAF </ORGANIZATION> Upper Heyford on June 30, 1988, and the security policeman on duty acted according to established procedure.'' The Guardian newspaper reported Tuesday that a shot was fired at civil servants working on the roof of a building. In other incidents, Ms. <PERSON> Bridge </PERSON> said, a gun was pointed at an engineer's head because he drove over a white line at <LOCATION> Lakenheath </LOCATION> and several workers were held at gunpoint for more than an hour during a maintenance check at <LOCATION> Alconbury </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> could find no record of those incidents. The <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> refused comment.

 A death squad opposed to the Shining Path guerrillas has threatened to kill a district attorney if he investigates charges that soldiers massacred dozens of peasants, his office said Tuesday. Police said members of <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist group, killed two policemen and wounded three in jungle raids. The <ORGANIZATION> Rodrigo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which has vowed to kill a Shining Path member or sympathizer for every person slain by guerrillas, issued the threat against District Attorney <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> on Monday, according to his office in Andean city of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> is investigating charges that troops rounded up dozens of peasants, accused them of being Shining Path members and killed them. The alleged massacre occurred in May near <LOCATION> Cayara </LOCATION>, a farming village 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>. Officials said the rebel raids occurred Sunday, at a police post and telephone relay station near the jungle city of <LOCATION> Pucallpa </LOCATION>, 325 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Shining Path guerrillas began fighting eight years ago. The government says more than 15,000 people have been killed and puts the property damage at $ 10 billion.

<TEXT>
 Hypnosis once was a business of quacks and charlatans, but now finds growing acceptance as a useful treatment and attracted hundreds of doctors to a conference this week. About 600 physicians, psychotherapists and dentists discussed and demonstrated modern applications of hypnosis during the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hypnosis </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Psychosomatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, which ended Tuesday. It is the 11th conference since the first in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in 1889. `` The process -LRB- of acceptance -RRB- is still going on,'' Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyck </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He is a professor of psychiatry at <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and was chairman of the conference's Scientific Committee <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyck </PERSON> said few nations restrict the practice of hypnosis to formally qualified therapists, with the result that unscrupulous practitioners can induce subjects to `` weird and fantastic behavior.'' Hypnosis first became popular in the late 18th century because of the work of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesmer </PERSON>, an Austrian physician who theorized about what he called `` animal magnetism.'' Only in the 1950s did it become a topic for serious psychological study, when the American researcher <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilgard </PERSON> designed a scale to measure a person's susceptibility to hypnosis. `` People who are easily hypnotizable ... have generally been more interested in the world of fantasy ever since their youth... They're often very creative,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyck </PERSON> said. In the 1970s, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> psychiatrists found hypnosis was valuable in helping war veterans overcome their traumatic experiences, he said, and today treatment of post-traumatic distress is one of its most important psychiatric applications. General practitioners use it to combat disorders ranging from tension headache to psoriasis, and dentists increasingly rely on hypnosis to help patients overcome fear of dental work. Some even use it instead of anesthesia. Reseachers are exploring whether hypnosis can help the disease-fighting immune system and help combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome. During hypnosis, a patient becomes susceptible to suggestions that would otherwise seem strange, although the patient generally retains some control over the process and can end the hypnosis if it is threatening. A hypnotic state can be induced by any of a dozen methods, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said, and most patients eventually can enter hypnosis alone. In a commonly used approach, a patient is asked to choose a point on the wall and stare at it, locking out other mental activity. In another, a subject is told to imagine his hand is getting lighter and eventually levitating. `` It's not without some danger,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyke </PERSON> said. `` There are people who really have a hard time resisting'' suggestions under hypnosis.

 King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> returned home Tuesday after a 24-hour visit to <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> ratified an agreement under which <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> donated 150 tanks and other military hardware to this country earlier this month. The official <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> donated 90 British-made Chieftain tanks, 60 American-made M-47 tanks, 19 British-made Scorpion reconnaissance vehicles and 35 motorized troop carriers. Arab diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week that the donation included tanks, artillery, surface-to-surface missiles and other equipment. The news agency made no mention of missiles or artillery. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said at the time that the equipment consisted of weapons seized by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Jordanian king was accompanied on the trip by Prime Minister <PERSON> Zaid </PERSON> <PERSON> Rifai </PERSON> and other officials. The Jordanian agency said the agreement was signed by <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s army commander in chief, Field Marshal <PERSON> Zeid </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaker </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Defense Minister <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khairallah </PERSON> It said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> expressed his `` deep appreciation to the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> leader and his brave army for the generous gift.'' Iraqi state-run television said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> conferred with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> on Tuesday before heading home No details were released. Arab diplomatic sources said the two heads of state discussed prospects of peace in the 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war and developments in the Israeli-occupied territories following <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s decision to sever ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have agreed to a United Nations-monitored cease-fire, which is to begin Saturday.

<TEXT>
 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Tuesday the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has allowed <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to `` drift aimlessly back into dangerous dependence on imported oil.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator also said that despite Republicans' adoration of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the the president's coattails will be very short when it comes to helping <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> get elected. Commenting later about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate on the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said: `` Of course we'll debate. I'm looking forward to it.'' `` I've looked across the aisle in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and I'll be looking forward to comparing our accomplishments in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and in turn what each of us could do for our running mate _ assuming we were elected _ in pushing through and influencing the passage of a legislative program for the new president,'' he said. Asked if he was surprised by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, `` No, not particularly. I really was n't concerned as to who it might be.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, speaking in this oil town after a visit to the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, said the nation's dependence on foreign oil is now greater than it was in 1973 when the Arab oil embargo caused gas lines across the country. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people understand ... that for eight years this administration has steadfastly refused to produce an energy policy that will protect <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national interests,'' he told the gathering of about 500. `` The Republicans tell you they have loosened <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s hold on the world's petroleum markets, but the numbers tell you that today <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is importing 42 percent of the oil we consume,'' he said. `` Our dependence has increased by 15 percent while this administration has been lulled to sleep by low oil prices,'' he said. The petroleum reserve program was launched in the wake of the oil shocks of the last decade. The six reserves are underground vaults of crude oil which can be retrieved in a national emergency. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> used the visit to the Big Hill site, the last of the six reserves, to underscore his and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s support for the program which eventually will put 750 million barrels of oil in storage. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, in shirtsleeves and a gold-colored hard hat with `` Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'' on the front, told a group of about 50 workers at the plant that the reserve is crucial to the national security and said he would like to expand it to a billion barrels. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has proposed cut in the program in the past, and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said only the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was able to keep it going. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been campaiging in his home state while the Republicans hold their convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and dominate the national news. Asked about the president's speech Monday night to the convention, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had `` an adoring crowd, and they enjoyed each other.'' `` I also believe that in the convention, and after the convention, as we go into the election, that it's <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> people are looking to, not <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' he said. `` And <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s coattails will be very short.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said there is a yawning gap between the Republican rhetoric and reality, including <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s charge that the Democrats' speciality is inflation `` Inflation is in the trade deficit,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, citing Tuesday's news that the trade gap had jumped back to $ 12.5 billion in June.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali-Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> may launch a series of air, sea, and land assaults on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> before a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war takes effect this weekend. A spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s mission at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that Iranian Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ja'afar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahallati </PERSON> was delivering that message from <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> on Tuesday. She spoke on condition of anonymity. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> earlier Tuesday asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> for swift approval of $ 75.6 million needed to support the 1,300 personnel who will monitor the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> cease-fire, beginning Saturday morning. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and relayed to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the cable from <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> warned <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that indications existed that the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government intends to launch the coordinated attacks before the truce begins. The news agency said <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> in his message told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has heeded <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> calls for restraint prior to the truce, and asked him and the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to take immediate steps to prevent <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> from jeopardizing the cease-fire. Iraqi Ambassador <PERSON> Ismat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON> declined to answer questions upon his arrival at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a meeting with the secretary-general. The meeting was at <PERSON> Kittani </PERSON>'s request. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping team should be in place by the time the cease-fire starts Saturday. `` It is essential that by that time <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observers should be on the ground ... to verify, confirm and supervise the cease-fire and withdrawal'' of troops, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told the members in asking for the necessary money for monitoring a truce. The financially ailing world body convened its 159-member General Assembly Tuesday and referred the funding request to its budget committee, which decided without a vote to approve $ 35.7 million for the operation's first three months. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was assessed $ 10.9 million of the three-month total. The committee asked the secretary-general to report back by Oct. 1 on the first phase of the operation and its costs. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said the assembly should assess its members $ 75.6 million to pay for the truce-monitoring effort for six months. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was expected to be assessed about $ 23 million of that amount. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> is to meet Wednesday to adopt the budget. A group of 73 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers arrived Tuesday in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a dispatch monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. A like number of observers arrived simultaneously in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, said Commandant <PERSON> Dermat </PERSON> <PERSON> Earley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping official. The head of the force, Gen. <PERSON> Slavko </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovic </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, left <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> Tuesday for <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, and is to travel to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> created the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> one week ago after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> agreed to observe the cease-fire. They are to begin direct peace talks Aug. 25 in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Preparations also are under way for the first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> naval force that is to patrol the disputed <PERSON> Shatt </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Arab </PERSON> waterway, where the war broke out in September 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is facing its worst financial crisis because of debts by its members, especially the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which owes $ 467 million of the $ 602 million in unpaid dues to the regular budget. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which also owes $ 70 million in assessments for peacekeeping forces, has withheld its dues to try to force the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to reform its budget, cut personnel and improve efficiency. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said it faces insolvency next month if the money is not forthcoming. About 350 members of the Iran-Iraq observation group will be unarmed military observers, 615 will be military personnel and about 350 will be civilian staff. On Monday, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of bombarding its troops with artillery and mortar fire. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> made its accusations in a letter from the Iraqi mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. It did not mention casualties or damage. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> denied a similar accusation last week. In the latest letter, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Iranian gunners over the weekend fired on the Iraqi southern port city of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> and the southern Faw peninsula.

 Intense heat once again set records Tuesday across the <LOCATION> mid-Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and the eastern Plains, while storms during the morning brought hail and tornadoes to parts of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. The hot weather was caused by an upper air high-pressure system anchored over the southeastern quarter of the nation. This upper air high has prevented the movement of storm systems and cooler air into an area from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, thereby allowing the oppresive heat and humidity to continue. Early Tuesday afternoon, temperatures were in the 90s in much of the eastern half of the nation. Readings between 95 and 105 were reported in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, eastern Plains and the lower <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> set a record for the most days of triple-digit temperatures in a year _ five, breaking the record of four set in 1936. The 100-degree reading by midafternoon also broke the high for the date of 98, set in 1937. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the temperature hit 100, making the 46th day of temperatures in the 90s or higher this season. In parts of the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> region, humidity levels dropped, but it still topped 90 in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, for a record setting 19th day in a row. Records for the date set or tied by midafternoon Tuesday were: 91 in <LOCATION> Beckley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; 90 in <LOCATION> Duluth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; 97 in <LOCATION> Eau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; 98 in <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, a tie; 97 in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>; 103 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; 100 in <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, S.D; 101 in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>; 99 in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; 100 in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>; 100 at <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; 92 in <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; 101 in <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>; 101 in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, S.D.; 97 in South Bend, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>.; and 102 in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Strong thunderstorms produced severe weather in parts of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> during the morning They formed along a front separating the intense heat to the south and cooler Canadian air to the north.

<HEAD>U.S. Institute Develops Case To Help Prevent Decay Of Mummies</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> has received a model of a show case designed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> that will help prevent the decay of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s royal mummies, the institute's director said Tuesday <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> told a news conference that American, Canadian, Spanish, German and Egyptian scientists had designed the nitrogen-filled case on the basis that inert gases preserve organic material and reduce biological growth. He said the case also could be used to conserve priceless antiquities such as manuscripts and objects made of organic materials including wood, leather and bone. <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> desplayed a small prototype of the case that is hermetically sealed. `` The new thing is that it is simple, will not cost much and includes a cocktail of nitrogen and oxygen,'' he said. Getty scientists developed the proper mixture of 97 percent nitrogen and 3 percent oxygen and the prototype was first shown in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last May, according to <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON>. He said tests involved a 3,000-year-old female mummy on loan from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and other Egyptian mummies from American museums. The first full-size case will be delivered to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in December and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> then is to build similar cases locally for its 27 royal mummies and put them on display, <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> said. The royal mummies, dating from 3,000 to 3,800 years ago, were discovered in a common tomb in 1881 near the southern city of <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> where ancient priests had hidden them from grave robbers. They have been held in a closed hall at the Egyptian Museum after being displayed from 1958 to 1980. Although thousands of mummies have been found and displayed, the 27 are considered to be the only royal mummies. Plans to put them on display last summer were postponed until the new show cases could be developed. <PERSON> Monreal </PERSON> said research in developing the case had cost the institute about $ 150,000. `` That is a very low cost if what you are trying to save are the most precious specimens of Egyptian history,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the selection Tuesday of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination, saying the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator's `` talent, intellect, family and energy will be valuable assets'' in the fall campaign. `` Vice President -LRB- George -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made an outstanding selection of Senator <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of his running mate,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a statement shortly after his arrival in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a three-week vacation. Earlier Tuesday, before leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> blessed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential quest anew and told his vice president that `` a great deal rides on this campaign.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> informed the president of his choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> during a conversation at the foot of the airplane ladder before the president boarded. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> was first elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as part of the Reagan-Bush team in 1980,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` He's a proven vote-getter. `` I've worked closely with <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> on a number of issues. He has been a leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for a strong national defense, particularly the Strategic Defense Initiative, and proponent of innovative job creation programs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added, `` His talent, intellect, family, and energy will be valuable assets during the campaign, and I know he will be a great vice president. I salute Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection. <PERSON> George </PERSON> has made an excellent choice.'' At the airport ceremony in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that `` <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I want you to know that you have all our support all the way, and all our love.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will receive his party's presidential nomination Wednesday in a formal roll call of delegates at the Republican National Convention. The brief greeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his vice president _ which took less than five minutes _ occurred under gray skies on an airport tarmac, with <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> One and Air Force Two in the background. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had just arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who addressed the convention Monday night, was on his way to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The meeting was arranged only recently by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, in part because of the questions that had been by raised the absence of any joint meetings between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the convention city. `` Well, ladies and gentlemen, the reason the vice president and I are meeting this way is a recent decision by the fire marshal in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> joked. `` He said that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is now so crowded he's not letting in a new Republican unless one leaves.'' It was a veiled reference to the overcrowding and closing of the <LOCATION> Omni </LOCATION> during the Democratic National Convention last month. `` But seriously ... <PERSON> George </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` a great deal rides on this campaign, and on you are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s hopes for continued peace and prosperity.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that `` by the time you leave office ... you will have done for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the greatest thing that a president could do. You will have left this country better than you found it.'' `` Today, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can see further because of your vision,'' he said. `` And now it's time to extend that vision into the next century. ... And I do not intend to fail.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will make at least a couple of trips a week in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behalf after the president returns from his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation on Sept. 6. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` wo n't get personal'' in his campaign rhetoric. `` He wo n't talk about <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but he'll talk about Republicans and Democrats and liberals in a way that you wo n't mistake the difference. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in fact, has been talking increasingly of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, without mentioning the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's name. During his rally speech here Sunday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> alluded to the `` stealth candidacy'' and said that he was sure <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would n't be holding a federal office in January. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> planned to mix pleasure with business during his vacation at his 688-acre ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. As has been the habit during the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' summer forays on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, the pair will travel to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for a few days to socialize with longtime friends. Before leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, the president signed four bills, including one requiring imported telephones to be compatible with hearing aids. The president wears a hearing aid. The other bills involved an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> land transfer and set aside August 9 as a neighborhood watch day and Labor Day weekend as a safe driving observance. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also was expected to act on several other pieces of legislation awaiting his signature, including a bill to overhaul the trade laws and to reinforce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws barring discrimination in housing. As for Monday night's address to the convention, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I think he felt very good about last night. At the reception -LRB- which the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> held later in a meeting room at their hotel -RRB-, he stayed until around 12:30, they were almost the last to leave. You could tell he was feeling up about the whole thing, savoring the evening.''

<HEAD>Entertainer Among 18 Arrested In Big Cocaine Bust</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A well-known Mexican entertainer who made body building part of her act sobbed a declaration of innocence Tuesday when she and 17 men appeared at a news conference as defendants involved with a drug ring. The Federal Attorney General's Office said <PERSON> Rossy </PERSON> <PERSON> Escudero </PERSON> and the others, 10 of them Colombians, were arrested in a raid that netted 1,500 pounds of cocain and involved a major ring that was smuggling the drug into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They were presented to journalists in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, including the purported ring leader, a Colombian identified as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. A statement from the Attorney General's Office, which coordinates anti-narcotics activity in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, called the operation the biggest victory of the year over drug dealers. It said the raid followed a six-month investigation. It said the cocaine, with an estimated street value of $ 500 million, was confiscated last weekend in <LOCATION> Bahia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kino </LOCATION>, in northwestern <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION> state, 210 miles south of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border. Those arrested were provisionally booked on charges of attempts against the health of the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> population, a catchall felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Most refused to talk to reporters but Ms. <PERSON> Escudero </PERSON>, weeping, insisted she knew nothing of the drug trafficking. She is a singer, dancer and physical culturist who has her own gymnasium and promotes female body building on national television. She has appeared in movies and in nightclubs. Authorities got on the ring's trail in March after a private plane crashed at <LOCATION> Barra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Navidad </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> state, with a large amount of cocaine aboard, the statement from the attorney general's office said. It said four people were later arrested in the <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> state capital of <LOCATION> Gudalajara </LOCATION>, 280 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, in connection with the crash but had to be freed for lack of evidence. The four were rearrested last weekend and now are among those in custody, the statement said. Investigators found the ring had an extensive communications network linking <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sonora </LOCATION>, with a secret headquarters at a hotel in the Mexican capital.

<TEXT>
 Comment in French newspapers Tuesday on the Republican convention included this report by <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravetz </PERSON> of the leftist Liberation on the French Quarter scene in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>: `` Even if, speaking frankly and by the criteria of old <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orlean </LOCATION>'s libertine ... reputation seems very excessive, it's fairly pleasing to see so many declared militants in the fight against lax morals, the right to abortion, homosexuality, pornography and stimulating substances, between two bottles of <LOCATION> Dixie </LOCATION>, the local beer, shouting encouragements at the appearance of a breast, the suggestion of a caress or the simulated copulation of a guy with a mustache. L'Humanite, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, said of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bad media image, making him seem colorless and maladroit, is obviously not enough to explain his lack of success. In the eyes of Americans, he is accountable for the anti-social policies waged for eight years by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which are not denied by the platform to be adopted by the Republican convention.'' The conservative <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> explained the choice of a running mate in a front-page editorial by <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacquet-Francillon </PERSON>: `` Things being what they are, logic would have a candidate choose as running mate the man best suited to continue his work, the one who most resembles himself, his best friend if possible. But that, alas, would deprive him of a precious trump card necessary for victory. `` A good running mate is not an alter ego. All that is demanded of him is to be able to deliver additional votes.

If the No. 1 is strong in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, it's best to chose a man from the South, or from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` Is this shocking? Perhaps.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has made his reputation in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as one of the chamber's most ardent supporters of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> build-up and a master of the minutiae of arms control and defense policy. In fact, the man picked Tuesday by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the Republican vice-presidential candidate broke with moderate Republicans last month and advised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to veto a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did just that, citing _ as did <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ the deep reductions in Star Wars spending. The junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> also was one of the leaders in a bitter 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> fight over <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Manion </PERSON>, a conservative <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> lawyer whose judicial nomination became a battleground over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s judicial philosophies. In addition, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where he has spearheaded the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's fight against raising the minimum wage, providing advance notice of plant closings and other labor legislation backed by unions. Even after <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conservatives, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and major business groups dropped their opposition to some labor-backed measures such as a ban on the use of lie detectors to screen job applicants, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> remained a vehement foe. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, has specialized in military issues as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He admitted he had little knowledge about the issue before coming to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but said he had made up for that by spending long hours poring over the arcane details of military policy, such as troop strength, weapons performance, and Soviet military doctrine. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is now ranking Republican on the conventional force and allied defense subcommittee, a panel which deals chiefly with the 16-member <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Last winter, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was one of the leading skeptics during the long <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate over the historic Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty, the U.S.-Soviet pact which eliminates medium - and short-range atomic-tipped missiles <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was one of the few senators on the Armed Services panel who attended virtually the entire series of hearings, including a number of long, detailed sessions devoted to taking testimony from military officers and think-tank experts about the possible effect of the INF pact on <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Before the hearings began, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was skeptical about the pact, even though it had been negotiated by a conservative president he admired. But he eventually ended up voting for it on March 27 when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ratified the pact by a 93-5 margin. Many of his questions centered on the issue of whether the pact would ban so-called `` futuristic'' weapons of the type envisioned by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 5-year-old Strategic Defense Initiative, the formal name of Star Wars. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s leading champions of <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, and it was that advocacy which last month led him to suggest that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> veto a defense bill providing for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted $ 4.8 billion next year for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, but the compromise measure proposed by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> provided $ 4.0 billion, a figure only slightly above the current $ 3.9 billion Star Wars budget. On July 14, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was preparing for final passage of the bill in a vote that would send it to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk, but <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> moved to return it to a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee so the Star Wars budget could be increased and Democratic-written arms control restrictions could be dropped. `` This is a political struggle between the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over who is going to run arms control policy, no question about it,'' explained <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleagues that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might veto the bill, but other Republicans, such as Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, said they had been told the president would reluctantly sign the measure. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s move lost, 58-35, but he said afterwards that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> should veto the measure and he was one of the first senators to praise the president when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did reject the bill on Aug. 3. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> described <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto as `` a good, sound decision.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was also involved in the fight over <PERSON> Manion </PERSON>, who had been appointed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to a federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Opponents said <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> was unqualified, but <PERSON> Republicans </PERSON> said he was being criticized only because of his conservative ideology. <PERSON> Manion </PERSON>, a son of the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Birch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, had received a `` qualified'' rating from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the lowest passing grade given by the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s judicial screening panel. <PERSON> Manion </PERSON> was eventually confirmed, 50-49, on a tie-breaking vote cast by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his vice-presidential role as presiding officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was a stronger television draw than the treasurer of the state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but not as popular as <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, according to overnight ratings compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The three broadcast networks combined for an average rating of 19.9 for more than 2 -LCB- hours of live coverage Monday night as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> made a farewell address to the Republican National Convention. That compared to a 17.7 rating for the first night of the Democratic National Convention, which featured a keynote address by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>. The biggest audience for the Democratic convention was on the second night when <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s speech pulled cumulative ratings of 23.3. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> led the pack with a 7.1 rating and 13 percent share of the audience, followed by <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> with a 6.8 rating and 13 share and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> with a 6.0 rating and 12 share. Each rating point represents 866,000 homes with television; the share is the proportion of sets in use during the time period. CBS' ratings may have been hurt because it stayed on the longest, until 11:55 p.m. EDT, when many viewers presumably had switched off. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> stopped at 11:40, minutes after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech ended, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> at 11:46. The combined share of 38 percent for the three networks was about half their normal prime-time audience. On the first night of the Democratic convention, the three-network share fell to 32 percent.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Tuesday he was mildly surprised by the selection of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. `` He's not very well known, but I assume and expect the vice president will make the reasons known for his picking him,'' the Democratic presidential nominee told reporters at a briefing in a room next to his Statehouse office. `` I did n't have any sense of who the vice president would pick, and I did n't spend much time on it,'' he added. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who had spent the day touring central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, returned to the Statehouse by helicopter late Tuesday afternoon and learned of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection by Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shortly after the news broke in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who chose <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> last month shortly before the Democratic National Convention, declined to discuss <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in detail. Instead, he emphasized <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s virtues, implicitly outlining the themes the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign may use against <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I'm very happy with my running mate. The more time we spend together and campaign together, the happier I am,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Senator <PERSON> Bensten </PERSON> is a mature, thoughtful man, with real stature _ somebody who's a real leader in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' the Democratic candidate said. `` He's already been a great asset to our ticket.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked if the choice of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> signaled an emphasis by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on defense matters. `` Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been seasoned, experienced on issues of foreign policy, defense, space,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, also citing <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s accomplishments in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year on trade, catastrophic health care, welfare reform and plant closings. `` That's the kind of stature, that's the kind of strength, the kind of maturity I think you want in a vice president _ especially when that vice president may be president,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said.

 The remaining tons of toxic waste dumped in eastern <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> have been removed and placed aboard a ship bound for <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the military government announced Tuesday. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Gado </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasko </PERSON> told reporters a ship hired by a West German firm sailed out of the port of Koko Monday afternoon with several tons of the waste. He did not identify the port in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> where the ship was expected to dock. Another ship last month took aboard the first load of the waste and departed for the Italian port of <LOCATION> Ravenna </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, where there were protest demonstrations. The Nigerian government said the waste was from 10 European countries and was shipped secretly to <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> by an Italian company. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> seized the Italian freighter Piave to press <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to remove the waste and announced that 15 people, including some Italian nationals, were arrested in connection with the dumping. The incident in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and attempts to arrange contracts to dump waste in other African nations provoked widespread protests. Several governments canceled contracts for waste dumping and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> demanded that waste already dumped be removed. A spokesman for the government's ruling council said this week that the council was considering a decree that would make the illegal dumping of toxic wastes punishable by death.

 A day after police evicted 12 homeless women and their children from a vacant, federally owned house, <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> officials agreed Tuesday to lease 55 vacant homes for $ 1 annually to shelters. The agreement was worked out with shelter sponsors after <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, a federal department, had police oust the squatters who broke into a $ 73,400, HUD-owned home over the weekend and refused to leave. The squatters were protesting the number of repossessed homes that are left vacant while homeless people move from shelter to shelter. <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, organizer of the protest, was arrested for investigation of trespassing after she refused to leave quietly, police said. King, who operates a shelter called the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> for battered and homeless women and children, denied the allegation, and said, `` I was placing homeless women and children in affordable housing. `` I'm so mad at him,'' she said of <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> <PERSON> Maples </PERSON>, regional director of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, who requested the evictions. `` I'm crying because I am so mad at the system.'' She said she had tried to obtain vacant houses for use by homeless women and their children through the official channels. On Tuesday, she was released from jail without bond, with a court appearance set for Aug. 26 on a trespassing charge. <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> defended the evictions as unfortunate but necessary. The precedent of allowing occupancy at will of vacant <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> buildings `` had the potential for being a very serious problem,'' he said Monday. `` Let me say as kindly as I can ... the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> will adopt and utilize legal and lawful measures to prevent people from trespassing. `` I not only do not relish doing that, I regret that it has to be done,'' he said. <PERSON> Maples </PERSON> met Tuesday with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> For the Homeless, the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the housing committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gilead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> to discuss the issue.

 A federal appeals court declined Tuessday to revive left-wing writer <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>'s legal challenge of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to give her permanent resident status. A divided three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here ruled that <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, who has fought deportation under the political beliefs section of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act, must follow administrative procedures to challenge INS actions in her case. The opinion by Judge <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> upheld last year's decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> that dismissed <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>'s lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> But the court noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' decision to suspend enforcement of the provision during the current fiscal year removes the danger that <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> will be deported. `` It therefore appears that the large question initially raised _ whether <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> could regain <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> citizenship _ is now reduced to the question _ when she can regain it,'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> wrote in an opinion joined by Judge <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, 51, an American-born writer who lives in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, renounced her citizenship in the 1960s after she had moved to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The writer, poet and photographer, who has also lived in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, returned to this country in 1984 to marry an American and teach at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>. She has four children, including two who are American citizens. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>'s lawyers contended that the court had the power to overturn a 1985 INS decision refusing her permanent resident status on the ground that her writings espoused world communism. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> said this decision was unconstitutional and therefore, her eligiblity to reapply for citizenship should be calculated from that date. The panel ruled it would not reach a decision on the case until that procedure is exhausted. `` Once the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apeals </ORGANIZATION> has rendered its decision, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> may proceed to the appropriate circuit court _ in her situation the Fifth or the Tenth Circuit,'' the court said. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikva </PERSON> filed a dissent, saying `` <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, I am convinced, would have obtained the status adjustment she seeks but for a governmental official's unconstitutional action.''

 Two gunmen burst into a bank early Tuesday, held police at bay for 14 hours and then fled with two hostages after authorities gave the robbers $ 160,000 and a getaway car, officials said. Police said the gunmen rushed into the Gladbeck branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> at 8 a.m., grabbed two employees and barricaded themselves inside the building. Police officials said the robbers had threatened to kill their hostages and fired warning shots through windows of the building. No injuries were reported. Witnesses alerted police, who surrounded the bank branch, police said. During daylong negotiations, officials finally agreed to meet the robbers' demands to hand over $ 160,000 and the key to the bank's main safe. `` It does n't matter whether we give them 300,000 marks -LRB- $ 160,000 -RRB- or a million. Our foremost concern is the hostages,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Fechner </PERSON> said. Police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the gunmen apparently took another $ 67,000 from the safe. Negotiators had continued to try to persuade the two gunmen to surrender, but they refused and demanded a getaway car, said Gladbeck police. At about 9:40 p.m. -LRB- 3:40 p.m. EDT -RRB-, the robbers and their hostages drove away in a police-supplied auto, police said. Police officials said they intended to follow the car and arrest the men. The hostages were identified as a male cashier and a female assistant. Gladbeck is about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>.

 Now I ask you _ should this country tolerate such cynicism? Should this country tolerate a campaign of deliberate deception? Should we tolerate a campaign that pits one American against another? Our party will not divide people, we will bring <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> together. We are not afraid to show our true Republican colors. Our purpose was spoken more than 100 years ago by a man who said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> means a government whose `` leading object is to elevate the condition of men _ to lift artificial weights from all shoulders _ to afford every person an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life.'' Those words were <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s. And my fellow Republicans, his creed is our creed. When we have followed it, we have succeeded. When we have deviated from it, we have failed. The very first act <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> signed as president was the Homestead Act. It offered land in the west to every American. It did n't matter if you were a man or woman, if you were black or white, if you were young or old _ as long as you worked the land. No new bureaucracy. No spending required. This Republican program limited government while offering to all unlimited dreams. Today Americans have the same dreams, but the answer to those dreams will not come through bigger government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. You see, that's what the Democrats offer. It's no wonder the most popular movie in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> during their convention was `` Big'' _ they thought it was a documentary on their philosophy. Liberal Democrats believe <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should manage dreams for all Americans. Republicans believe Americans should have the freedom to achieve our dreams ourselves! Republicans believe that if liberty is threatened anywhere, it is threatened everywhere.

 We will never turn our backs on the refusenik in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the black student in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or the brave freedom fighter in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> is right when she says that when it comes to defending <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> knows best. All I can add is a warning. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats will try to talk tough. But do n't be fooled. They may try to talk like <PERSON> Dirty </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>. But they will still act like Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>. We live in a dangerous and uncertain world. We need the ship of state in seasoned, strong and steady hands. I am a student of history. I want to tell you something Americans need to understand. In 200 years, there has never been a candidate for president whose experience in world affairs and knowledge of foreign nations has exceeded that of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. We must stay the course at home, as well. If the Reagan-Bush years have proved anything, it is that the heroes of the American economy are not paper pushers along the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, but dream makers in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats do n't believe that. According to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, two thirds of the delegates in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said they wanted higher federal taxes.

They call for an end to economic violence. What it really means is taking from those who work and simple giving to those who do n't. What does it add up to? More taxes. And where's <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>? Well, he's promoting `` mandated health insurance.'' Yet the idea seems eerily similar to a colossal program for socialized medicine right out of the platform of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>. What does it add up to? More taxes. And then there is their nominee. Every day, he endorses another congressional spending bill `` in concept.'' Well, to paraphrase Sen. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirksen </PERSON>, a little concept here and a little concept there, and pretty soon you are talking real money. What does it add up to? More taxes.

 Look beneath the rhetoric. Add up all the way-out programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. What does the name of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sound like to you? More taxes. At a time when costs are rising, when we are paying more for insurance, housing, medical care and college tuitions, the liberal Democrats want to take money out of the pockets of working men and women because they think <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> can spend it better. Now, I know those Democrats like to insist they understand the average person. But the average people I know do n't want to pay higher taxes. Low taxes create jobs better than any government program. In my state, the Reagan-Bush tax cuts have created almost three-quarter of a million new jobs _ good jobs with bright futures. And here's one governor from a northeastern state who is not afraid to give credit for our economic miracle to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. But the Reagan-Bush recipe of low taxes and economic freedom is not just working in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The recipe is working far beyond our borders. Around the world, people are voting with their feet for capitalism over communism. Just think for a moment. How many West Germans climb the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> to </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ not one! How many Malaysians pack up to move to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>? Not one!

And even communist nations are finally realizing that <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> knew about as much about economics as <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>. The People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is experimenting with free enterprise. Even the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is changing.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s senior law officer is studying requests by a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and a private group that he file blasphemy charges to stop the showing of `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' a spokesman said Tuesday. `` The matter is under consideration,'' said a spokesman for Attorney General Sir <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON>, commenting on the condition he not be identified. Many Christian leaders have denounced <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s film. One scene shows <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> fantasizing about abandoning death on the cross, marrying prostitute <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and making love to her. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehouse </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most prominent campaigner against media permissiveness, said she wrote last week to <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON> asking him to consider whether the film is blasphemous and could lead to a breach of the peace. Legislator <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also urged <PERSON> Mayhew </PERSON> to investigate to determine if the movie is blasphemous and could lead to violence if screened in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In 1976, Mrs. <PERSON> Whitehouse </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Listeners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, brought the only blasphemy case in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in more than a half-century to court. Her successful civil action prevented the Gay News newspaper from publishing a poem that said <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was a homosexual. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s centuries-old law defines blasphemy as `` any contemptuous reviling, scurrilous or ludicrous matter relating to God, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, the Bible, or the formularies of the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' `` The Last Temptation,'' which opened to packed houses last weekend in seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities and two in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, will be seen by British censors Aug. 25. `` Until that time, we ca n't confirm the release of the film or say anything about the film,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, a spokesman for the film's distributors, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>.

 And most of all, we want freedom to know that our future will be made right here; in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Many of us have been blessed with good jobs, good homes and good families, but we also care about those who are not so fortunate. We have to care. Because their future is now our future. Their tomorrow is our tomorrow. The simple truth is: there are no spare Americans any longer. To those who are ill-schooled, ill-trained or ill-housed _ we must reach out and lift the artificial weights as <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> promised. As Republicans, we will do it not only because economically it is the only thing to do, but because morally it is the right thing to do. One hundred years ago this summer, an ex-slave and proud Republican stood before another convention of our party. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> said, `` A government that can give liberty in its Constitution ought to have the power to protect liberty in its administration.'' One hundred years later, bigotry and intolerance still threaten. We have seen it in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, and too many other places. Republicans will make it clear _ we will search out bigotry and racism _ we will drag it into the sunshine of understanding and make it whither and die. We Republicans offer liberty not just from prejudice, but from poverty. The Democrats gave us the war on poverty _ and poverty won. <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it best: `` The war on poverty failed, because by the time it trickled down to the poor all we got was scraps from the table.'' We offer poor Americans not the junk food of more big government, but the full meal of good private sector jobs. Our idea is simple. Cut taxes in inner cities and new businesses and new jobs will flock to places like <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. The idea works. In my state, these tax cuts _ called urban enterprise zones _ have created over 20,000 jobs, in neighborhoods that were torn by riots 20 years ago.

 We would create thousands more good inner city jobs tomorrow, if the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would stop blocking <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s enterprise zones program. We discovered something in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ every time we take an unemployed person and give them a job, we take a Democrat and turn him into a Republican! But good jobs will not matter if our children do not have the skills to fill them. As a child, I had a terrible stutter. I also had dyslexia. I overcame those problems, but I could n't have done it alone. I went to a good school. I had good teachers. Today, a lot of children across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> struggle with problems. With a little help from a good school or a great teacher, today's stuttering child could be tomorrow's keynote speaker _ today's potential dropout could become tomorrow's <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> That's why Republican governors are leading a revolution in American education. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Hunt in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The Democrats' response is always the same _ spend more money. But Republican governors understand that money wo n't make a difference unless we change other things as well. No more automatic passing of students from grade to grade. If you ca n't write or read or count, you do n't deserve a high school diploma. Mediocrity can never be tolerated in teaching. From now on, hard work and creativity must be rewarded every single day. When schools fail year after year, let's admit it is the fault of adults, not children. Stop blaming the children. Fix the schools. And children can not be educated if their minds are clouded by drugs. Kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are merchants of death.

 Gunmen thought to be Sikh extremists killed a police informer and three bodyguards in a <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> farmhouse before dawn Tuesday, police reported. Four other Sikhs were shot dead elsewhere in the northern state, where radicals are fighting for an independent Sikh nation they would call <LOCATION> Khalistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The extremists often kill moderate Sikhs who do not support them. Police said officers killed four Sikh suspects in shootouts and a fifth died when he took poison after being arrested. The informer was <PERSON> Surjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who provided information leading to the capture of two militants, police superintendent <PERSON> Izhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> said. At least five people armed with automatic rifles attacked the farmhouse and killed <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and his bodyguards after separating them from the women and children. <PERSON> Alam </PERSON> said <PERSON> Surjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Jagtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, was wounded.

 I agree with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Those who dispense illegal drugs, should be prepared to have death dispensed to them. My father told me about roots and wings _ roots so that a child knows where he's coming from and wings so that he can soar on his own. The roots are our values. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is right, our families and our schools should teach children the difference between right and wrong _ that honesty is the best policy _ and, at the risk of offending some people, there is nothing wrong with young Americans reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will offer the wings of great schools and good jobs. The head of that administration will also reaffirm our roots. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a decent man _ and he should n't have to defend his being one. If defending values such as loyalty, family, or belief in God is no longer fashionable, then I fear for our country. There is another value, and it comes from the Bible. `` One generation passeth away and another generation cometh: but the Earth abideth forever.'' So wrote <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>. Never has the need for environmental protection been written more beautifully. Today our air is plagued by acid rain _ our oceans and beaches are sullied by sewage and syringes _ our very future threatened by sunburn from above and poisoned water from below. The party of <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> must regain our environmental heritage. In the 1990s we are going to clean <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from one coast to the other _ you know what? We are going to start way up north _ in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>! Can jobs and trees go hand in hand? Yes they can, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is going to prove it. What do Americans want? Not litmus tests. Not special interest politics. They want something very simple _ good jobs with high wages; clean water and air; streets free from drugs; great schools, an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong abroad so our children will live at peace. These desires, like a parent's love, know no color or culture or creed.

 With these issues, and with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the helm, we will go to the farms and the cities; to the various and the union halls; to the suburban developments as well as the country roads. Let us send one message to the Democrats this evening _ we will not concede one single vote anywhere! Let the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats offer the politics of delusion and exclusion. We Republicans will practice the `` Politics of inclusion.'' When I was young, I often listened to a song about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> called, `` The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> I Live In.'' The song asks the question: `` What is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to Me?'' It speaks of old <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> _ of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> and the task that still remains. It says, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the right to speak my mind out and the air of feeling free.'' The song concludes very simply, `` The town I live in, the street, the house, the room, the pavement of the city or a garden all in bloom: the church, the school, the clubhouse, the million lights I see, but especially the people, that's <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to me.'' <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is this and so much more. But <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has to be this and so much more for everyone. You see, we are pilgrims on this ship called liberty. We carry with us the dreams of our forefathers _ whether they came on the Mayflower, or the slave ship, or whether their ship docked at <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> or the Port of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. If the free nations of the world represent the fleet of democracy, we are the flagship. If we flounder, the future of the free way of life will sink with us, but if we succeed, other nations will follow in our wake. We have a historic mission. We must prove to the world that in this voyage of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> no one for reasons of race or background is ever left behind _ but that everyone is on board. For all of us are crew on this ship of freedom _ all of us serve, publicly or privately _ at our own stations. It is our generation's watch on deck. Each of us as a parent can make our house a home _ each of us as a worker can make our job a vocation _ each of us as a citizen can make our community a neighborhood. With God's help, we will reclaim the faith of our fathers _ we will `` practice the Politics of Inclusion.'' With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as our leader, we will redeem our American Dream. Thank you very much.

 AIDS demonstrators and a Dixieland band greeted Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he cruised into the Big Easy by riverboat on Tuesday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> laughed as the Re-Birth jazz ensemble ambled across a stage in Spanish Plaza along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He did n't acknowledge the knot of protesters who started shouting a few seconds into his glad-to-be-here speech. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> partisans tried to shout down the demonstrators, who carried signs criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for failing to do enough to combat acquired immune deficiency syndrome. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s backers held their `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'88'' signs high to block the protest messages from the vice president, who was about 30 yards away Within five minutes, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> police and plainclothes security officers encircled the demonstrators, whose arms were locked, and pushed them farther from the podium. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never stopped his speech. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, and several hundred supporters arrived at the plaza aboard the riverboat <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION>. A banner on an ornate upper-deck railing proclaimed, `` Steaming To Victory.'' The <LOCATION> Natchez </LOCATION> was preceded by a fireboat that spewed three plumes of water _ colored red, white and blue. Restored vintage military aircraft, including an Avenger like the one flown by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in World War II, soared within 500 feet of the cheering crowd. Youngsters like <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> McCree </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> member who'll be eligible to vote in 1996, carried pro-Bush posters that were distributed by grown-up supporters. `` I think I'll vote someday,'' <PERSON> McCree </PERSON> said, but he was stumped by a query about his party preference. `` Huh?'' he said. <PERSON> Brocton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 13, another <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> member, clutched a crumpled paper bag from a drug store. Inside were a couple of Boys Club T-shirts, sizes large and medium, that he hoped to hand to the vice president. But he had trouble penetrating the throng that lined a police barricade from the stage to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s waiting motorcade. <PERSON> Lorean </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBranch </PERSON> wore a styrofoam boater with a red, white and blue band. `` They threw it to me just before the rally _ like <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>,'' she said while keeping track of a half-dozen kids. The riverboat's calliope wailed `` Dixie,'' as dark clouds swirled overhead. But rain did n't come during the rally.

But my friends this election is not about the past, but the future. A great deal about the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign can be summed up by one incident. You see this flag of red, white and blue? It symbolizes the land of the free and the home of the brave. Well, their media consultants in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said they did n't think the colors looked good on television. So they changed red to pink, blue to azure, and the white to egg shell. Well, I do n't know about you, but I believe Americans, Democrat and Republican alike, have no use for pastel patriotism. But the liberal Democrats are trying to hide more than the colors in our flag _ they are trying to hide their true colors. They want higher taxes. But they wo n't say so. They want to weaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But they wo n't admit it. And they want to play the politics of special interests. Last week, in a rare moment of candor, a prominent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrat </PERSON> explained their strategy to a reporter from <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> Quarterly magazine. What he said shocked me, and I have to share it with you. He said Democrats' advice to special interests was, and I quote, `` ... Just Shut Up. Gays, women, environmentalists. Just shut up, and you will get everything you want after the election. In the meantime, just shut up so we can win.''

 East German soldiers roughed up a West German man at the border between the two countries and then led him away, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> police said Tuesday. Quoting witness reports, West German border police based at <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> said the man rode his bicycle up to an East German border crossing Monday afternoon. The man, who was in his 50s, talked with East German border guards at the control point, then walked through a security gate onto East German territory, police quoted the witnesses as saying. The East German soldiers then threw the man to the ground, searched him, and took him away in an automobile, according to witness reports. West German border police said the incident occurred near <LOCATION> Brochthausen </LOCATION>, 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. West German border police said they did not know the name of the man, who they identified as West German, or why he crossed into communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s official news agency, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, reported Tuesday that East German security officials arrested a West German man on `` suspicion of military espionage.''

The man was arrested and an investigation begun, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The brief report did not say when or where he was arrested and provided no further details.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Tuesday returned President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` facts are stubborn things'' line in a counterattack which blamed the administration for rising interest rates, budget and trade deficits and several foreign policy debacles. `` Iran-Contra. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Facts are stubborn things,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters a day after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used the same refrain to list his accomplishments in an address at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` This is a nation that eight years ago was the largest creditor nation in the world,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said shortly after the administration released figures showing a sharp increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. `` Today we are the largest debtor nation in the world,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That's the consequence of eight years of borrowing and spending and borrowing and spending. Facts are stubborn things and these are the facts we are going to be debating ... It will be Mr. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> who will have to respond to those facts.'' Later, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> responded to the selection of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, saying the conservative senator was not well known and that his own choice _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ was far more experienced than <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` Senator <PERSON> Bensten </PERSON> is a mature, thoughtful man, with real stature _ somebody who's a real leader in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Senator <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been seasoned, experienced on issues of foreign policy, defense, space. That's the kind of stature, that's the kind of strength, the kind of maturity I think you want in a vice president _ especially when that vice president may be president.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aides immediately attacked <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s record, criticizing him for supporting a freeze on Social Security benefits and his opposition to plant closing, drought assistance and civil rights legislation. `` He does not understand the economic problems facing the American family,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` We learned today that the vice president ca n't keep a secret and that instead of showing himself as a man in his own right he placated the extreme right wing of his party.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, wrapping up an annual visit to central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said he expected the vice president to cut into his lead in the polls because of the usual convention bounce. But he said he did not expect the boost to last or that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s personal popularity would help the vice president `` Things will settle down,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` This is an election between <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The question -LRB- voters -RRB- are going to be asking themselves is which one of us has the ability to lead.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his speech to the GOP convention Monday night, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be elected because the nation could not afford to have a president who would need `` on-the-job-training.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> laughed when asked about that remark and then said: `` The same might have been said of the Republican nominee in 1980,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> governor. `` None of us comes to the presidency with on-the-job training, least of all vice presidents,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. Senior <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> told reporters that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign did not believe <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech hurt <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or was any great help to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He also said the campaign did not believe criticizing the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administratrion, as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did Monday night, would be effective for the Republicans, a position <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> echoed at his news conference just after <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>'s briefing. `` This election is n't about the past,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's about the future, it's about our economic future. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said he was not bothered by the harsh criticism of him at the Republican convention. `` If you went through what I went through in the mid-70s, it's a day at the beach,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who was voted out of office in 1978 after raising taxes and slashing welfare benefits in his first term. He returned to office in 1983. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading out Wednesday on a four-day campaign trip that includes stops in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He said he spoke to former rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Wednesday morning and had spoken to him several times in recent weeks. No joint campaign appearances have been scheduled as yet, but will be soon, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It's going to be a close relationship,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. The governor's schedule for the day included a meeting with regional editors and publishers, the swearing in of a judge, a meeting with an anti-crime council and the distribution of more than $ 300,000 in grants for drug education programs. He also toured an apple orchard in the central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Northboro </LOCATION>, where he had a luncheon with area farmers and environmentalists. During the meeting with the local news organizations, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the defense authorization bill `` a strictly political veto'' that would undermine national security. `` What kind of a contribution to national defense and national security is that?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. `` Now we've got mass confusion in addition to all the scandal. That's not the way you build a strong America.''

 Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> is rarely at a loss for words, and neither are his allies and opponents when it comes to describing the Republican minority whip. Outspoken. Straight-shooting. Gutsy. Self-deprecating. Fiery. Down-to-earth. Witty. This biting style has won <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> both praise and criticism, but it also raised nagging questions at the Republican National Convention, where he was frequently mentioned as a possible running mate for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may have looked long and hard at <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, but on Tuesday afternoon he settled on fellow Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Was the man who once scolded reporters for trying to catch President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> off balance and `` stick it in his gazoo'' too outspoken to be vice president? Would he have been a liability on the campaign trail? `` It is if I get smart-alecky,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said Monday, noting the thin line between good humor and sharpness. But as he reflected on the record and public statements of Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> smiled and said, `` I can just see how you can have a lot of fun with this chap.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> played down his prospects of landing on the Republican ticket, and this past weekend said he had asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to remove him from his list of possible running mates. `` I would be a liability,'' he said, because of his support of politically unpopular positions. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, while generally regarded as a conservative, supports a woman's right to abortion, limiting Social Security benefits and is open to a tax increase to deal with the federal budget deficit. `` I've had a very checkered career. I've punched the lights out of a lot of sacred cows,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said in an interview with NBC News. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, who had urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to select a staunch conservative, agreed with <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s assessment. `` He's a man of great self-control, strong feelings, a hell of a sense of humor,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` His one problem is right-to-life. That would create an opening for the Democrats.'' For some, though, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> would have been the ideal vice presidential candidate. `` He's outspoken in a very acceptable way,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, who along with <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> serves on the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` He's humorous, gutsy.'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said the 6-foot-7 <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> has an `` Ichabod Crane'' appeal, referring to the tall, gangly character in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Irving's `` Legend of Sleepy Hollow. His sense of humor is always close to the surface. Consider <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>'s speech to the convention Monday night. `` There was the good news and bad news from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` The good news was that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> laid all those cards on the table. The bad news is they were all face down.'' Next, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> introduced to a national audience the slogan he had unveiled earlier in the day in the form of black-and-white campaign buttons found on the lapels of the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> delegation. `` The Democrats asked the wrong question. The question was not ` where's <PERSON> George </PERSON>?' The question is, ` who's <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>?'''

<HEAD>Radioactive Water Leaks to Open-Air Cooling Canal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fifteen workers at the <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> nuclear plant had to be decontaminated Tuesday after about 3,200 gallons of mildly radioactive water leaked from a spent-fuel pool, utility officials said. No injuries were reported and radiation levels were safe, officials said. The employees who helped clean up the spill in the open canal were decontaminated by washing off their shoes and clothes, said <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the plant's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. A radiation inspector from the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was en route to the plant, which the federal agency has listed as one of the nation's 10 worst `` There's no health threat at all to anyone inside or outside the plant,'' <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` This water could have been released to the cooling canal under controlled conditions anyway without violating regulations.'' Plant workers and <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspectors were monitoring radiation levels in the canal, and initial readings were only 5 percent of allowable maximum levels, <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorion </PERSON>, founder of the private Center for Nuclear Responsibility and a longtime foe of the plant, called the event alarming. `` Any incident that happens in a spent fuel pool should be taken seriously,'' she said. The long canal system inside the plant boundaries allows heat to dissipate from non-radioactive cooling water warmed by the reactor core, a function performed by cooling towers at many other nuclear plants. The canal is just off <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> but is not directly connected to it. The leak began in a 30-foot deep pool where spent fuel rods are kept in a building adjacent to Unit 4. A 1-inch valve broke on a pump that keeps the pool water circulating slowly, allowing water to pour out at 100 gallons a minute, Ms. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` Most of the fuel has been there at least a couple of years, so the water is not highly radioactive,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> noted. By just after midnight the pool level had dropped about 2 inches, setting off an alarm at the plant's control center. When plant workers rushed to the site, they found the building's floor flooded and water pouring out the door. The water flowed across a paved area into a storm drain that leads directly to the canal system. Resident <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inspectors were at the site by 3 a.m., <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. Unit 4 has been shut down for unrelated reasons and was to start up again Tuesday. The plant 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was again this year identified by the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> as one of the nation's worst. <ORGANIZATION> FPL </ORGANIZATION> has been fined repeatedly for violations ranging from corroded bolts holding the reactor together to guards found asleep at their posts and unauthorized people allowed into the control room. Last year the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> ordered wholesale changes at <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, and the utility submitted an independent management consultant's report The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> sent the report back for changes, and coincidentally, <ORGANIZATION> FPL </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it has resubmitted a 134-page plan to the agency. The document calls for hiring more experienced personnel, reducing overtime, shortening maintenance backlogs, and better organizing maintenance schedules.

<HEAD>Commission Will Probe Soldiers' Shooting of Youths</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A provincial mayor confirmed Tuesday that four youths were killed by army gunfire last weekend and said he was one of those named by the central government to a committee to investigate. Radio Haiti-Inter said Tuesday that four youths were killed and two wounded when soldiers fired without warning on a meeting in the remote town of <LOCATION> Labadie </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Chrysostome </PERSON> of Petite Riviere de l'Artibonite, the capital of the province involved, denied the report of the two wounded. He was the first government official to comment on the shootings. The national government has issued no official statement. Repeated inquiries by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in person and by telephone proved fruitless. First word of the incident was broadcast Monday by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> station, which reported 10 dead and an undetermined number of wounded. The Rev. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trieste </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>, later told the AP the lower casualty figures given by Haiti-Inter probably were correct. Trieste said his station got its information from five youths who were at the meeting when the soldiers fired, but that the five were still in a state of shock, which would account for the inflated number of victims they reported. The investigating commission began work Monday, headed by <PERSON> Lafortune </PERSON> <PERSON> Sintilus </PERSON>, commander of the army barracks in the zone, Haiti-Inter reported. It said other members include Chrysostome; three policemen; a justice of the peace; a magistrate and local Police Chief Esperance <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Haiti-Inter </PERSON> said three masked men, one dressed in an olive green uniform and the other two in civilian clothes, fired without warning at a meeting attended by about 350 people. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> said the meeting was celebrating the second anniversary of the founding of the Youth Club of <PERSON> Labadie </PERSON>. It said this was a grassroots group affiliated with a provincial organization which in turn was linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, an organization opposed to the military government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Labadie </PERSON> lies 80 miles north of the capital city of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> and near Petite Riviere de L'Artibonite, scene of violent political conflicts before the aborted presidential elections last Nov. 19.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Decolonization approved on Tuesday a Cuban-sponsored resolution keeping the issue of U.S.-Puerto Rican political relations on the committee agenda. The resolution, adopted by a vote of 9-2, expressed concern about allegations that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for decades has persecuted tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans who seek independence for the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island that is now a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commonwealth. Puerto Ricans are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. During two days of testimony, more than three dozen Puerto Rican speakers addressed the committee. They reflected the political divisions among those who want <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statehood, those who would continue the commonwealth status and those who demand independence. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not participate in the debate or voting. It walked out of the committee in 1971 and has not returned. It has said the committee is interfering in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. Voting for the resolution were <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> voted against the measure. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> abstained. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> were not present for the vote. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seized <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in 1898 during the Spanish-American War. In 1952, Puerto Rican voters overwhelmingly passed a referendum favoring commonwealth status and the following year the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> removed <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> from its list of territories considered to be colonies. Since 1973 the decolonization committee has adopted numerous resolutions calling <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> a colony and demanding self-determination for its people. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected all the declarations, saying the committee is anti-American. In a 1984 election, 95 percent of the island's voters rejected pro-independence parties but were divided over the statehood-commonwealth issue.

 Republicans who have been patting themselves on the back for picking the Superdome for their national convention have gotten a few kicks in the rump from people who have been cupping their ears to hear. Technicians were adjusting the sound system Tuesday after former Sen. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s 1964 presidential nominee, complained that he thought the sound was terrible. At one point Tuesday morning, the sound system went on the blink while Rep. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, R-Md., was giving a speech The acoustics on the podium itself must not be very good, because Mrs. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> kept talking even after the sound went out. She stopped when someone tapped her on the shoulder and told her the microphone was dead. After a few minutes and a couple of piercing squeals of electronic feedback, the sound was restored. Superdome General Manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was quick to point out that the sound system is the one the Republicans had installed for the occasion. `` It is not the Superdome system,'' he said. On Monday night <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> was seated in the box reserved for Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to listen to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s farewell speech. `` Where I sat I did n't hear a word,'' <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON> said Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. The vice president's box, as well as the one where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sat Monday night, are half a football field away from the podium, and the problems with the sound system were compounded by the presence of 36,000 people, many of whom were talking to each other. Conditions are no better on the convention floor, where the pretty red carpets are laid atop a temporary plywood floor. Even delegates seated close to the podium have to strain to hear above the constant rumble made by thousands of shuffling feet. `` I said I was serving my time this morning,'' said <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gault </PERSON>, an alternate from <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, who was seated in the delegate section. <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> delegates, who have relatively good seats, are all but forcing the alternates, who sit in the back of the hall, to trade places with them. The seats at the back of the hall are not near the plywood flooring, and the sound is better. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardue </PERSON>, a convention spokeswoman, said adjustments were being made to the sound system and more speakers were being put on the floor Tuesday. She said the adjustments were necessary because the building's acoustical characteristics vary with the number of people in the hall and where they sit

<HEAD>Chappell Supports Accountant's Appearance Before Grand Jury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., said Tuesday he approved of his former accountant testifying before a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, which is investigating defense department procurement practices The accountant, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, testified Tuesday before the federal panel concerning the <ORGANIZATION> Wind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadows </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racquet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> once owned. According to published reports, two men tied to the defense industry intervened in a foreclosure lawsuit against <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> involving the racquet club. They were <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>, a defense consultant and former <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> aide, and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dalferes </PERSON>, vice president of governmental affairs for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON>, heading up the company's lobbying arm. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> disclosed in July that it has acquired the <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION> racquet club from the investors, who had earlier purchased it to help <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>. In a statement released by <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>'s office, the veteran congressman, who is chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that oversees billions of dollars in defense spending, said: `` Recently, there have been reports concerning financial records and transactions surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> Wind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadows </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racquet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. As I have indicated in the past, I want to answer all questions concerning the <ORGANIZATION> Wind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadows </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and any other issue that has been raised. `` That is why I wanted my accountant, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, to provide information to federal investigators,'' <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> said. The congressman, who is seeking re-election to an 11th term in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said because of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s accountant-client privilege laws, the only way <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> could answer questions about the club was before a federal grand jury. In a July release, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> officials said they knew of <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON>'s involvment when the company purchased the club. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> has a plant in <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> and corporate offices in <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> has said the club was a good investment because the property has a market value in excess of the purchase price. The company said it paid $ 200,000 for the club, and it is listed on <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> tax rolls for $ 214,967. <PERSON> Chappell </PERSON> has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in connection with the racquet club or in his relationship with Armtec. `` The congressman's status in this investigation has not changed. In fact, we are confident that as we provide more information, it will become even more apparent that all of the congressman's transactions have been and are proper,'' his office said.

 Abortion opponents sang `` God Bless America'' and nearly overwhelmed police at a clinic Tuesday in a demonstration that ended when 157 activists were jailed in the largest mass arrest since weeks of protests began. A total of 593 protesters have been arrested since the demonstrations began four weeks ago during the Democratic National Convention. As of Monday, 178 remained in jail because they refused to identify themselves. Demonstrators sang and prayed as they blocked entrances to the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> SurgiCenter, a frequent target of protests staged by the New York-based Operation Rescue. The clinic performs abortions and other surgery. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the arrested people would be charged with criminal trespass and with giving false names. Traffic was snarled in the area around the clinic after protesters blocked Spring Street, a major artery. The abortion opponents, led by Operation Rescue leader <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, found 20 officers waiting for them when they arrived at the center. Police also observed the protesters' activities from helicopters. About 70 police and corrections officers formed a barrier and quickly arrested three or four protesters involved in a shoving incident that strained the makeshift police line. The shoving began as officers shifted positions to keep demonstrators away from the clinic. `` There is no possibility that we will stop the rescues unless Mayor -LRB- <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> -RRB- Young would like to make an executive decree closing down the abortion mills in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> said. Fifty-eight of those arrested during earlier protests identified themselves during hearings at the city jail Monday and posted $ 500 bond each. Twenty other protesters continued to identify themselves only as <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON> or Baby <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Bush Breaks the Suspense, Taps Quayle as Running Mate</HEAD>

 Republican presidential nominee-to-be <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> broke the suspense that had gripped this convention city and picked on Tuesday youthful Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as his running mate. `` Let's go get'em,'' shouted an exuberant <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> designated him as his choice at a rally on the shore of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Left in the lurch were a dozen or so leading Republicans, several of them better known that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who got the bad news in a series of brief telephone calls from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. One by one, in the hours after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> landed at <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, word leaked out that one or another vice presidential prospect had been eliminated. Thus the convention pastime, Name That Running Mate, became a process of elimination. It was only a short time earlier that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made it known he had made his decision, but intended to keep it a secret. The secret became harder and harder to keep as prospects were eliminated. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> coordinator, said the decision to make the announcement Tuesday rather than wait until Thursday as originally planned was because `` there seemed to us to be a little bit of flatness in the convention, and this puts a lot of pizazz into today's program.'' Others who had been on the list were quick to praise the choice that ended their dreams of sharing the national ticket. `` I told the vice president I'm going to look forward to campaigning for a <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> ticket in 1988,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, who had openly coveted the nod. `` I told him, ` Mr. Vice President, I want you to know my support is unconditional.''' Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., also considered for the post, called <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` a young, good choice. `` I knew <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> was on the list and I think it's an excellent choice,'' he said. `` My first choice was <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. ... <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will be a very attractive choice.'' Among the first to receive the phone calls from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> GOP leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and his wife, former <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as telling him, `` We do n't need to go South for a running mate.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s information ruled out two Tennesseans _ former Gov. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a former senator and White House chief of staff. As names dropped by the wayside, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> added a new one _ Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> prisoner of war. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> apparently knew but he was n't saying anything other than to tell his <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> delegation: `` I think you'll be very pleased.'' The South is considered <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s strongest region in the fall campaign against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, although the selection of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nomination was a direct challenge to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the state he calls home. As he flew to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Two </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters he had made his decision but intended to keep it a secret a while longer. He said the final phase in the process came `` just before I climbed onto this plane. Today, with finality.'' `` I want an opportunity to properly notify the person I will nominate,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, explaining why he was delaying further his announcement. Word of the selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got out as the vice president arrived by riverboat in the convention city. `` It is <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that we will work for,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, as he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stood together at the podium. The choice of the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> look-alike, was likely to bolster the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, a region where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> fared poorly in the primaries. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who defeated Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> in the 1980 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslide, has a strongly conservative voting record, certain to please the delegates at this GOP convention. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committees. Two of Bushes top advisers _ pollster <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> and media expert <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON> _ also have worked on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s congressional campaigns. In <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, much was made of the resemblance between the young congressman and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. At one point, the actor sent <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a telegram complaining about the look-alike references in his promotional literature. After he won, he sent <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> an autographed picture of himself. Asked about the comparison this week, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sighed. His blue eyes flashed as he brushed his brownish-blond hair aside impatiently. `` I've had that stigma since I first ran for the Senate. It's stuck ever since,'' he says `` Obviously I'd rather talk about the issues. I think I have a feeling of what <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> went through. ... I'd rather talk about what I stand for than what I look like.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had a brief meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Belle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chasse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, with president on his way to a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation, the vice president on his way to assume his role as his party's choice as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor. When reporters asked <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> if he knew the identity of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, the president replied: `` I'm not sure that he knows. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and said, `` I know.''

 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a giant in the legal and sports professions, was mourned by legends from both worlds Tuesday at a funeral mass at St. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>' Cathedral. Former presidential contenders, cabinet officers, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, media executives and sports hall of famers ranging from baseball's <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimaggio </PERSON> to football's <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurgenson </PERSON> were among more than 1,000 people who paid their last respects to the superlawyer who died Saturday after a long battle with cancer. <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' driver when he was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION>, typified the sentiment echoed by all when he said, `` The Big Man is gone, but he fought a good fight.'' The taciturn <PERSON> DiMaggio </PERSON>, a close friend and board member of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>, owned by <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, commented simply: `` I'm happy to be here, to say my farewell.'' After the mass, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was buried in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION>'s Cemetery, near his home in <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb. The Rev. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, pastor of <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had been confined to his home 10 days ago from the 11-year battle against the cancer first detected in his colon. <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> still would attend mass either in the morning or the evening. `` Just a little over a week ago, he looked at me with his eyes and he said, ` I do n't think I can beat it this time,''' said <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>. `` He was ready for the final battle ... to meet his God.'' Among those who attended were former senators and Democratic presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakato </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, Iran-contra lawyer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, former vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Eunice </PERSON> <PERSON> Shriver </PERSON>, a member of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> clan, former <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> and various current and former stars of the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> brought two buses for their staff, including manager <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> who said <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> `` was not only an outstanding individual but a friend.'' Former <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> came along. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had been been president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> for 20 years before becoming the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>. Former <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION> coach <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Pardee </PERSON>, now with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, former quarterback <PERSON> Jurgensen </PERSON>, running backs <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Riggins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, linebacker <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, defensive back <PERSON> Brig </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> and others represented the football team.

National Football League Commissioner <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozelle </PERSON>, accompanied by Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>, said, `` It is a great loss. He put up a hell of a fight.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was a celebrated trial lawyer and influential <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider whose clients ranged from the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' leader <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffa </PERSON> to former Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Lawn Sprinkling Ban To Be Lifted In Twin Cities Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Homeowners in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will be able to water their lawns again starting Wednesday because rainfall in the region has replenished the drought-parched upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, officials said Tuesday. Municipal officials decided to lift the ban on most outdoor water use after they were given the green light at a meeting of a subcommittee of the state-federal drought task force. Rainfall in the region so far this August has been above normal. The ban, which affected the two cities and 15 suburbs, was imposed three weeks ago after the flow of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> dropped below 1,000 cubic feet per second for only the fourth time since 1932. State officials said the river flow Tuesday morning at the <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION> dam was 2,800 cubic feet per second. Rainfall in the Twin Cities during the first two weeks of August has exceeded the combined total for May, June and July. Rainfall also was adequate across central and northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, topped by 6.5 inches last week at Grand Rapids, near the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s headwaters The sprinkling bans were imposed to reduce water drawn from the river and avert the need to tap six headwater reservoirs. Consumption in St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> had dropped by nearly 30 million gallons daily in each city.

 Spearheading a Republican attack on <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' limited foreign policy experience, former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> said Tuesday night that the Democratic presidential candidate's approach to world affairs is dangerous and naive. In an address to the Republican National Convention, Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' policies would leave the nation vulnerable to nuclear attack and remove any incentive for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to make a nuclear arms control bargain. With repeated assertions that `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Knows Better,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> characterized the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> approach as `` collectivism in domestic affairs, weakness in defense and confusion about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s role in the world. She called <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' policy pronouncements to date `` deeply disturbing,'' criticizing him for advocating cuts in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal, ending the `` Star Wars'' strategic defense initiative and emphasizing a buildup in conventional arms. `` We know <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> favors negotiations,'' she said. `` But his proposed unilateral cuts would leave the Soviets no incentive to negotiate ... <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> does n't say he will make <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> more vulnerable, but that is the inevitable consequence of canceling major weapons systems.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> said the nuclear threat to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> comes not only from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> but from the half dozen other countries whom she said either have or soon will have nuclear weapons and the capacity to deliver them on target. `` To speak as though we could defend ourselves against these weapons with more and better tanks is simply ludicrous,'' she said and added: `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> simply does not take the need for a defense seriously.'' `` This attitude that weak is strong and vulnerable is safe _ is extremely dangerous,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is more worried about an American president's misuse of power than about an adversary's use of it.'' Reckless anti-American leaders in trouble spots around the globe and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, `` make the world too dangerous for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to rely on naive, unrealistic, uninformed strategies to defend our freedom,'' she said. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people know there is no cram course for learning about global politics, world needs, nuclear strategy, national security,'' she said. `` It takes years of study, practice, and of being there.'' She accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of hiding his true intentions behind deliberately vague rhetoric. `` In the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign there is a large, carefully cultivated discrepancy between conservative style and liberal substance,'' she said and asked: `` Will it fool enough of the people for long enough to elect <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>?'' `` We need a president who understands the world,'' she said. `` We can not settle for less.''

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his quest for the presidency, is promising to uphold the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> legacy on taxes, the economy and defense, while trying to soften the Republicans' image on education, the environment, child care and other domestic concerns. The Republican presidential nominee-to-be has been campaigning in day care centers as well as defense plants, has called for a moratorium on drilling for oil off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast and a ban on ocean dumping. He has proposed bigger and more specific education increases than Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tells voters everywhere, `` I wo n't raise your taxes, period.'' He even backs lowering the tax rate on capital gains from 28 to 15 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contends that particular tax cut would produce more revenue for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, not less. Apart from his concept of letting the overall budget grow no faster than inflation, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not specified what programs would be trimmed back to pay for his new spending initiatives or rapid deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative. While his party has accused the Democrats of making promises in their platform that could cost taxpayers $ 43 billion, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials said Tuesday they do not yet know how much it would cost to implement everything in their platform. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the platform chairman, apologized. `` It's been a busy week,'' she said, and she said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign would provide answers in a few days <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is running on his experience in foreign affairs, from his days as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, envoy to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and director of central intelligence to his globe-trotting duties of the past seven years as a stand-in for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. After some hesitation, he has promised to deploy a space-based defense shield _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> _ `` as soon as feasible,'' and has accused his Democratic foe of favoring `` unilateral disarmament.'' But while pledging to keep <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> strong and to maintain the policies that ushered in 69 straight months of economic growth, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is also emphasizing domestic issues that were not at the top of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agenda _ or budget. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who says he would be `` the education president,'' has proposed a $ 500 million program to reward schools that succeed with children from poor homes. He also wants to increase the Head Start budget, and create tax-free college savings bonds. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wrestles with a $ 2.5 billion Democratic child-care bill, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing his own $ 2.2 billion, child-care tax credit targeted at low-income families. Gingerly, this vice president who prides himself on loyalty has broken with the official <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> posture on ethics in government, the environment, and the civil rights of AIDS patients. He has suggested he would take a harder line on human rights issues during arms control talks with the Soviets, and promised to `` avoid swings between unjustified euphoria and exaggerated pessimism'' in dealings with them. On defense spending, which doubled in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, `` I believe that the administration's approach in rebuilding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s defenses is fundamentally correct.'' But he promises to overhaul <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement and `` have no tolerance for waste.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports a mobile MX missile, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says that the Midgetman missile _ a single warhead weapon that would be hard for the Soviets to locate _ `` could enhance stability.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backs a 10 percent tax credit for oil and gas exploration. He opposes an oil import fee. On reducing the federal deficit, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, `` The most important action we need to take ... is to hold the line on taxing and spending.'' Like <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he favors line-item veto authority and a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. He has proposed `` a flexible freeze,'' that would allow most programs merely to keep pace with the rate of inflation. But to make room for new spending initiatives, some programs would have to be trimmed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to exempt Social Security from budget cuts. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s domestic policy director, cited child care, ethics, the environment and `` safe streets'' as key issues of concern for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes abortion `` except in the case of incest, rape or to save the life of the mother.'' He favors Medicaid funding of abortion only to save a mother's life. On AIDS, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said the government may have to spend more on research and education. He endorsed a presidential commission's call for legislation to protect the civil rights of AIDS victims and those with the virus _ a step <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> refused to take On illicit drugs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he would make `` the war on drugs a top priority.'' But he says the war will never be won unless young people can be convinced to steer clear of drugs. He promises `` to see that all American families are able to obtain decent, affordable housing,'' primarily by keeping interest rates down, but also by continuing housing aid to low-income families. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said, `` We must do more to meet the needs of the homeless,'' including development of community-based mental health clinics. On crime, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he will `` appoint judges who will crack down on criminals,'' and he will seek to `` stop hamstringing our police.'' In particular, he favors admission of illegally seized evidence in criminal trials if the police had a good faith belief their search was lawful. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports the death penalty for those who commit `` heinous'' crimes, including cop-killers and drug kingpins. On health care, he promises `` a comprehensive effort to reduce the cost and improve the quality of, and access to, health care in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He would seek to squeeze `` waste and inefficiency'' from <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid and promote health maintenance organizations. He favors tax incentives for group insurance plans to pay for long-term care, and wants to allow <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> to be converted to pay for long-term care. He also would ease Medicaid requirements that force the needy elderly to `` spend down'' their life savings before qualifying for help. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who once ran an oil-drilling operation in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, says, `` there is no way to meet our energy requirements without offshore drilling,'' but he would delay lease sales in `` extraordinarily sensitive areas'' like the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast until it is certain the coast will not be harmed. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> favors full decontrol of natural gas, greater reliance on coal and retention of nuclear power as `` part of our energy mix.'' On ethics, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised to establish a White House ethics office to hold government jobholders to `` an exacting code of conduct.'' He also wants the federal ethics law applied to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as well as those in the executive branch. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes an Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution and any move to require federal registration of gun owners. He supports laws to allow voluntary prayer in public school.

<TEXT>
 A Cuban-born <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent with a doctorate in law testified Tuesday that he was told he could n't be a legal adviser for the agency in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because of his dark skin and accent. Appearing as a witness for Hispanic agents suing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for discrimination, <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Mata </PERSON> also said he was ostracized by his colleagues in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office for participating in a fund-raiser for the lawsuit. The agents _ 311 of whom have joined the suit being tried in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ contend that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> discriminates against Hispanics in hiring, promoting and disciplining. They are seeking damages and a change in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> promotion practices. The lawsuit, say Hispanic activists, could have ramifications far beyond the agency. `` The'60s were the decade of blacks; the'70s were the decade of women,'' <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, co-counsel for the plaintiffs, said. `` The'80s and'90s are the decades of the Hispanics. Hispanics are here to be reckoned with. We think the laws should be applied to them equally.'' <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lara </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected more lawsuits contesting discrimination by government agencies against Hispanics. `` Once we get a ruling on this issue, we're going to take this issue all over the country,'' he said. `` This is sort of a detonator that will get this issue going.'' He said the case is important `` not only for law enforcement, but for other departments as well, such as government offices in other entities such as social workers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which is defending the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, has dispatched a total of 23 people to mount the defense, including two teams of lawyers, paralegals and non-Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. The plaintiffs' legal team comprises three lawyers. Government lawyers in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and department officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> refused comment Tuesday on the case. Also Tuesday, a statistical analyst hired by the plaintiffs testified that the numbers show Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents are less likely to hold higher level jobs. Of 9,000 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, 400 are Hispanic, or 4.4 percent. Hispanics make up 8 percent of the population. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFree </PERSON>, associate professor of sociology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, testified that 15 percent of Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents with at least five years of agency experience are managers, compared with 21 percent of non-Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents with the same level of experience. Hispanics and non-Hispanics do equally as well on management test scores, said <PERSON> LaFree </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Matt </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who originally brought the suit, is the highest ranking Hispanic in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. He is second-in-command in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. Mata, with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, testified that a few years ago he applied for a job as legal adviser in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He was an assistant legal adviser in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> at the time. He was turned down for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> job. `` I was told that as a person who spoke with an accent and who had dark skin that looked Hispanic, it would look bad for me to represent the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Mata </PERSON> did not attribute what he was told to any individual. In his testimony he referred to his supervisors vaguely as `` they'' or `` them.''

<TEXT>
 Gay rights activists jeered Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> upon his arrival Tuesday for the Republican National Convention and were escorted away by police when confronted by angry <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters. One demonstrator was later arrested and booked with disturbing the peace. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was seconds into his speech at a riverside rally when a dozen demonstrators began shouting from about 30 yards away. The protesters, mostly young men, locked arms and stood in a circle, facing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters who shouted back, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'88.'' The demonstrators carried pink and green signs accusing the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of failing to fight acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and chanted `` 40,000 are dead of AIDS _ where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' As the crowd pressed in around the demonstrators, some <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters shouted obscenities and one reached to tear down a protester's sign. A man in the crowd pulled him away, saying, `` Do n't do it, it looks bad.'' Some in the crowd held pro-Bush signs high to cover those of the demonstrators, who police hustled away within five minutes. One demonstrator later was arrested. Earlier in the day, about 20 people staged an uneventful protest at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> pharmaceutical company, <LOCATION> IMREG </LOCATION>, which makes one of the few drugs found to have an effect on AIDS. The government has not yet approved the drug for public use. All was quiet, meanwhile, at <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where a stage and sound system was set up for demonstrators this week. The convention has drawn relatively few protesters.

<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the prepared text of the keynote address by Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to the Republican National Convention on Tuesday night. ... A great deal about the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign can be summed up by one incident. You see this flag of red, white and blue? It symbolizes the land of the free and the home of the brave. Well, their media consultants in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said they did n't think the colors looked good on television. So they changed red to pink, blue to azure, and the white to egg shell. Well, I do n't know about you, but I believe Americans, Democrat and Republican alike, have no use for pastel patriotism. But the liberal Democrats are trying to hide more than the colors in our flag _ they are trying to hide their true colors. They want higher taxes. But they wo n't say so. They want to weaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But they wo n't admit it. ... We are not afraid to show our true Republican colors. Our purpose was spoken more than 100 years ago by a man who said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> means a government whose `` leading object is to elevate the condition of men _ to lift artificial weights from all shoulders _ to afford every person an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life.'' Those words were <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s. And my fellow Republicans, his creed is our creed. When we have followed it, we have succeeded. When we have deviated from it, we have failed. ... Today Americans have the same dreams, but the answer to those dreams will not come through bigger government in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. You see, that's what the Democrats offer. It's no wonder the most popular movie in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> during their convention was `` Big'' _ they thought it was a documentary on their philosophy. .... The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats will try to talk tough. But do n't be fooled. They may try to talk like <PERSON> Dirty </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON>. But they will still act like Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>. ... In 200 years, there has never been a candidate for president whose experience in world affairs and knowledge of foreign nations has exceeded that of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. We must stay the course at home, as well. If the Reagan-Bush years have proved anything, it is that the heroes of the American economy are not paper pushers along the <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION>, but dream makers in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. ... The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats do n't believe that. ... They make promises without a price tag. ... Add up all the way-out programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. What does the name of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sound like to you? More taxes. ... Eight years ago, we gained power because Americans yearned for freedom. Freedom from the shackles of high taxes, freedom from the tyranny of inflation, freedom from the burdens of big government. And we wanted freedom from the embarrassment of an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that wore a `` kick me'' sign on its back.

 Well, we Republicans delivered. After eight years of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, our country is stronger, safer and better today _ and Americans are proud to admit it! But new challenges lie ahead. ... we want new freedoms. Freedom from racism. Freedom from poor schools. Freedom from polluted oceans. Freedom from crack dealers. And most of all, we want freedom to know that our future will be made right here; in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Many of us have been blessed with good jobs, good homes and good families, but we also care about those who are not so fortunate. We have to care. Because their future is now our future. Their tomorrow is our tomorrow. The simple truth is: there are no spare Americans any longer. To those who are ill-schooled, ill-trained or ill-housed _ we must reach out and lift the artificial weights as <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> promised. As Republicans, we will do it not only because economically it is the only thing to do, but because morally it is the right thing to do. ... As a child, I had a terrible stutter. I also had dyslexia. I overcame those problems, but I could n't have done it alone. I went to a good school. I had good teachers. Today, a lot of children across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> struggle with problems. With a little help from a good school or a great teacher, today's stuttering child could be tomorrow's keynote speaker _ today's potential dropout could become tomorrow's <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> ... When schools fail year after year, let's admit it is the fault of adults, not children. Stop blaming the children. Fix the schools. And children can not be educated if their minds are clouded by drugs. Kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are merchants of death. I agree with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Those who dispense illegal drugs, should be prepared to have death dispensed to them. ... <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a decent man _ and he should n't have to defend his being one. If defending values such as loyalty, family, or belief in God is no longer fashionable, then I fear for our country. ... Today our air is plagued by acid rain _ our oceans and beaches are sullied by sewage and syringes _ our very future threatened by sunburn from above and poisoned water from below. The party of <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> must regain our environmental heritage. In the 1990s we are going to clean <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from one coast to the other _ you know what? We are going to start way up north _ in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>! ... Let us send one message to the Democrats this evening _ we will not concede one single vote anywhere! Let the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats offer the politics of delusion and exclusion. We Republicans will practice the `` Politics of inclusion.'' ... With God's help, we will reclaim the faith of our fathers _ we will `` practice the Politics of Inclusion.'' With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as our leader, we will redeem our American Dream. ...

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s name was raised in a sex-and-influence scandal when he was a member of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1981, although he denied having an affair with the woman involved, lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>. `` That's been looked into and there's absolutely nothing to it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, soon to become <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, now the junior senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, was one of three <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who shared a cottage with Mrs. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> during a golfing vacation in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in January 1980. Mrs. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, who appeared nude in <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine that same year, said she was going to tell <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigators that she had love affairs with `` fewer than a dozen'' <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. And she told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in March 1981 that she had videotaped one of her sexual encounters with a congressman. Neither the tape or the name of the congressman _ if there was such a congressman _ have been made public. She also told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that she had accepted $ 500 in cash a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to pay for the abortion of their unborn child. The name of that congressman also has not surfaced. At the time of the incident, Mrs. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> was 30 years old and separated from her husband, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>. She was a registered lobbyist for an insurance industry group opposed to proposed legislation to set up a national crop insurance program. The bill passed by a 235-150 margin in September 1980, and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted against it. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigated Mrs. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s activities, but in August 1981, officials dropped the case and did not file criminal charges. `` She gave us some salacious accounts of purported activities with congressmen, but there was no evidence of federal violation,'' sources said at the time. The two congressmen besides <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> who shared the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cottage with Parkinson were Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Railsback </PERSON>, R-Ill., and Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Del <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON> said she had an affair lasting seven months with <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, who later left the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> declined to characterize the nature of his relationship with Mrs. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, but did say: `` I deeply regret any association I ever had'' with her.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says comparisons to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> are a `` stigma'' he must bear. But beyond the golden good looks, the man tapped for the No. 2 spot on the Republican ticket aims to be taken seriously. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Tuesday before a cheering crowd on the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> riverfront that he had chosen <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s junior senator as his running mate. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stepped up and told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` Let's go get'em.'' An ardent conservative in his second <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> term, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has seen little of the national spotlight and has yet to attain the level of peer respect enjoyed by his senior colleague, Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, 41, acknowledges that he was not exactly a household word when news came that he was a hot vice presidential prospect. With his youth and movie star looks, he was quickly mobbed by the media at the Republican National Convention. He basked in the attention. `` A few more days of this _ we can take it,'' he joked at one point. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> admits that `` life has been very good to me. I never had to worry about where I was going to go.'' Tuesday, sharing the stage with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the crowd he was honored and `` a bit humbled,'' and went on to invoke `` what my grandfather told me: that there is nothing more important in this country than freedom.'' He added, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will keep the freedom and peace of this world.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for his part, introduced <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as `` freedom's friend ... a man of the future. A young man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Later, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` a man of the future ... a leader for the future'' and `` an excellent campaigner.'' He said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s youth and the fact that his wife had practiced law and had been `` a professional woman'' enhanced his value to the ticket. Born in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a member of a prominent publishing family, the <ORGANIZATION> Pulliams </ORGANIZATION>. His grandfather was <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and News, the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gazette </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, is publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Press </ORGANIZATION>. He attended <ORGANIZATION> DePauw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which many of his relatives attended, joined the family's fraternity of choice and waited tables at a sorority house for $ 40 a month. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, at law school, and they were married 10 weeks after their first date. `` Everything clicked perfectly,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, also a lawyer. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was associate publisher of the <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Press </ORGANIZATION> from 1974 to 1976, when he was elected to the House. Five months into his second term, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> announced he would challenge veteran incumbent Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>. It was in the 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race that much was made of the resemblance between the young congressman and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. At one point, the actor sent <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a telegram telling him to stop the look-alike references in his promotional literature. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> replied that it was the fault of the media, not his literature. After he won, he sent <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> an autographed picture of himself. Asked about the comparison this week, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sighed. His blue eyes flashed as he brushed his brownish-blond hair aside impatiently. `` I've had that stigma since I first ran for the Senate. It's stuck ever since,'' he says `` Obviously I'd rather talk about the issues. I think I have a feeling of what <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> went through. ... I'd rather talk about what I stand for than what I look like.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> defeated <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON> with 54 percent of the vote, and easily won re-election in 1986. When he first arrived in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he was dismissed by many as a blow-dried golden boy. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> set to work to erase that image, and carved out a niche for himself on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where he specializes in matters involving the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance. He supported the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration view that research for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s space-based missile defense system, popularly called Star Wars, is permitted under the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. He was a proponent of the president's recent veto of the defense authorization bill, which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> opposed because of various arms control restrictions. In the <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been a hard-line conservative, speaking out to recommend more money for defense. And he was a chief opponent in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> of plant closing legislation to require companies to give workers advance notice if a plant was going to be shut down. He is proud of his accomplishments during his first years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, when the Republicans still had the majority and he helped devise and enact a new jobs training program. An avid golfer and vigorous campaigner, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is also a family man who likes to keep separate his personal and public life. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has talked to his wife and three children about the impact of a vice presidential race on their family and said that, all things being equal, he would not choose to make a run for national office this year. And he already has experienced one negative side effect of the heightened public attention. During the speculation about his vice presidential prospects, some newspapers recalled a 1980 scandal involving lobbyist <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, who shared a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> house with several lawmakers, including <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, then a congressman, on a golfing vacation. <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>, who later posed nude for <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>, said she had an affair with one of the lawmakers _ not <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who denied any relationship with <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has n't asked him about that episode. And he reiterated that he had done nothing wrong. `` That's all public record. I think people who know me and know my family know there's no factual basis to what has been written,'' he said. `` If you try to say that somehow I was implicated, that's just not true. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> acknowledges that `` in this day of scrutiny,'' such publicity seems to come with the territory. For the vice presidential nominee, `` there are 15,000 journalists who want to grab him by the ankles, turn him upside down and shake him until something bad comes out,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Firefighters Keep Eye on Fires Close to Montana Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Firefighters kept a close watch Tuesday on fires threatening homes in a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> town, while high winds fanned flames in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s Yellowstone National Park and elsewhere in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Two wind-driven fires burned out of control Tuesday in the southeastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> town of Lame Deer, threatening housing developments and forcing the temporary evacuation of 40 houses Monday night. Fire crews, which had carved lines around the flames, stood by in case the fires jumped the lines. The 12,000-acre Slick blaze crept to within 300 yards of houses southwest of town Monday, and a 1,500-acre fire 1 -LCB- miles to the northwest burned up to and around a trailer home before crews blocked its path with a fire line, said fire information officer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. Winds of 12 mph to 15 mph hampered firefighting efforts early Tuesday, but the wind shifted later and began blowing the fires back into themselves to the south, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, dry, windy weather delayed control of the 2,175-acre Ruby Rapids fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Nez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in the west-central part of the state, but firefighters were having more success in other parts of the state. At <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, home of the famed Old Faithful geyser, park officials reopened the west entrance Tuesday, but fallen trees and poor visibility from a 60,000-acre fire forced them to keep 14 miles of road closed. `` There's quite a lot of fire activity there again today, -LRB- and -RRB- they're still cleaning up from yesterday,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>. The 292-space Madison Junction campground also remained off-limits to tourists Tuesday. Heavy winds were hampering efforts to combat the flames, which have charred about 241,000 acres of the country's oldest national park. `` The only help we're getting is from the cooler temperatures,'' said <PERSON> Anzelmo </PERSON>, adding that thermometers Tuesday afternoon had hit only the mid-70s. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, a few days of rain have given a major boost to the crews that have been trying to get the upper hand on forest fires for weeks. Both the <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> forests in west-central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> were hit by more lightning Monday, setting off new fires. But most were small and quickly controlled, forest officials said. `` Every night we can count on getting hammered,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Zabinski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Perce </LOCATION> information officer. Winds up to 30 mph and dry weather pushed back the control time on the Ruby Rapids fire along the <LOCATION> Main </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from Monday to Wednesday. An incendiary device was found at the scene, and the Salmon Ranger District is offering a $ 5,000 reward for information about the apparent arson, Ms. <PERSON> Zabinski </PERSON> said. To the south, fairly steady rain fell for a third day on the <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said lightning activity diminished, and rain was expected to continue sweeping through the forest. `` Things are looking real good,'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, officials closed public access to 58,000 acres in the fire-ravaged <LOCATION> Elkhorn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> about 10 miles southeast of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. The area was closed as a safety precaution and will remain closed until further notice, said fire information officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON>. A fire in the mountains increased from 3,000 acres Monday to 4,175 acres after winds fanned flames 200-300 feet high and sent the blaze racing along a mountain ridge into heavy timber. The fire continued to burn uncontrolled late Tuesday, <PERSON> Krepps </PERSON> said.

 New Jersey Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, using his keynote address to launch an unrelenting attack on the Democratic opposition, told the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his party talk tough like <PERSON> Dirty </PERSON> <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> but `` act like Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>.'' `` They want higher taxes but they wo n't say so,'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said. `` They want to weaken <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> but they wo n't admit it. And they want to play the politics of special interests.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> governor, selected to give the prime-time speech because of his success in attracting traditional Democrats to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, coupled his attacks on `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats'' with a vision for a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory in November. Touting his trademark `` politics of inclusion,'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> declared, `` We will not concede one single vote anywhere.'' `` With <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the helm, we will go to the farms and the cities; to the barrios and the union halls; to the suburban developments as well as the country roads,'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said. `` Let the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats offer the politics of delusion and exclusion,'' he said. `` We Republicans will practice the politics of inclusion.'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> took note that the Democrats chose a color scheme of pastels at their national convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last month, rather than red, white and blue. `` I do n't know about you, but I believe Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, have no use for pastel patriotism,'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said in remarks prepared for delivery to the convention. `` The liberal Democrats are trying to hide more than the colors of our flag. They are trying to hide their true colors,'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said. Democrats chose the pastel colors after deciding they would look better on television. While repeating the `` Dukakis Democrats'' refrain, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> never specifically intoned the name `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'' in his remarks. Laying out a course for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> must convince voters that it is the party `` willing to tell the truth to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would return <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to `` the oppression of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s inflation'' and weaken the international might restored by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> Democrats will try to talk tough. But do n't be fooled. They may talk like Dirty Harry. But they will still act like Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said. Dirty <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> is the hard-talking, quick-shooting cop portrayed by <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> tough guy <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Eastwood </PERSON>. Pee Wee <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> is the squeaky-voiced wimpish television and movie personality. In a speech that <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> said saw a dozen drafts, he quoted <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and the Bible, and invoked <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> symbols like the Pilgrim ship Mayflower and <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>. And, in another <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> barb, the governor even cited a Hollywood classic. `` Only in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> could the Democrats draft a platform that has ` Gone With The Wind,''' he said. The famous Civil War film is set in the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> capital. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, a moderate, is completing his second term as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> governor. Elected in 1981 by the narrowest margin in state history, he was returned to office four years later by the largest. In that election, he won the support of more than 60 percent of the state's blacks and minorities <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> is the son of the late Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, a 20-term House member, and his ancestors include several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s first constitutional governor. Forebearer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> was a contemporary of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who appointed him first cashier of the Bank of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the family's influence can be seen at <ORGANIZATION> Kean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and in the town of <LOCATION> Keansburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> first saw politics at his father's elbow. The boy commuted between the family's home in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and their estate in <LOCATION> Livingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where he still lives with his wife and their three children. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and earned a master's degree in history from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He taught high school and later had a stint at running the family real-estate business. First elected to the state <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1967, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> captured the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> four years later, and again in 1985 in one of the state's most dramatic political tales. In 1981, <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> emerged from a field of eight would-be <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> governors to win the nomination by less than 40,000 votes. He won a narrow victory in the general election over Democratic Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, eking out a win by less than 1,800 votes. Four years later, voters retained <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> by the biggest-ever margin, with 70 percent of the vote and majorities in all but three of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s 567 municipalities.

 A state appeals court Tuesday ordered a county medical medical center to stop feeding a 77-year-old woman who is the focus of a right-to-die battle, but stayed the decision for five days to give the county a chance to appeal. In a 3-to-2 decision, the state <ORGANIZATION> Appellate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> upheld a lower court ruling that the woman, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, can be removed from all artificial life support systems. Mrs. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, has been physically and mentally incapacitated by a series of strokes. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Westchester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> say she is conscious but unable to speak or swallow. She has been fed intravenously, and the hospital also wanted to use a nasal feeding tube to provide nutrition. The judgment was stayed for five days, however. `` It's a precedent-setting situation,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the medical center. `` What we have here is a conscious patient and a decision being made by surrogates as opposed to a patient who is brain dead or in a persistent vegetated state.'' He said a decision had not been made whether to appeal to the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s highest court. The woman's daughters, both licensed practical nurses, initiated the right-to-die battle last month to stop the medical center from inserting the nasal feeding tube and to halt the intravenous feeding. They said their mother had told them on numerous occasions that she would not want to be kept alive by artificial means. `` We agree with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that Mrs. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s desires, expressed when she was competent, to decline any life sustaining treatment, including a naso-gastric tube and intravenous feeding, in her current condition, was established by clear and convincing evidence,'' said the decision written by Justice <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Magano </PERSON> and signed by Justices <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Balletta </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> dissented. <PERSON> Balletta </PERSON> wrote: `` In the absence of a medical consensus that a patient in Mrs. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s condition would not suffer severe pain and thirst in the process of dying without hydration and nutrition, it is in my view that it is cruel and inhuman to sentence her to death which will be accompanied by such extreme discomfort.'' <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON>, who represents Mrs. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>'s daughters, said he `` obviously agreed'' with the appeals court decision but said he expected the legal battle to continue. On July 26, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Colabella </PERSON> ordered that the medical center stop efforts to feed Mrs. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and allow her to die. <PERSON> Colabella </PERSON> directed that the hospital provide painkillers and help get Mrs. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> home. His trial-level ruling was stayed while the medical center appealed to the Appellate Division.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did n't need <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate to win <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s 12 electoral votes. After all, if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't on his own win a state that has voted <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> 11 times out of 12, he's in deep trouble. No, the strategy behind the choice of the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator is generational: the 64-year-old <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> choose <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> because he is 41 years old and looks younger. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a man of the future, a young man born in the middle of this century and from the middle of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in announcing his choice Tuesday, `` a dynamic young leader for the future of this party.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice presents a stark contrast to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' strictly political decision to tap 67-year-old <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for his running mate. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> selected <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to help him win <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' 29 electoral votes _ a classic case of <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> strategy. Any other benefits from the choice are just icing on the political cake. Indeed, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is the first member of the post-World War II baby boom to be named to a national ticket, leading campaign chairman-to-be <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to call the decision `` a bold stroke across the generations.'' It `` should give us a chance to appeal to baby boom voters,'' said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser. `` He's within my generation,'' said 31-year-old <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wark </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> delegate. `` He's not my grandfather.'' `` He looks like one of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s sons,'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s state party chairman <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiskell </PERSON> said The argument that a baby-boom candidate would win more baby-boomer votes is fiercely debated in the political and academic communities, but little data is really available to test it. After the 1988 election, maybe we will know more. Republican strategists do argue that younger voters are the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>'s hope of becoming the majority party in this country. Those whose political life covers only the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidencies tend to be heavily Republican. If that group can be kept within the party, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> will get stronger and stronger as the more Democratic older voters pass from the scene. In some polls, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been doing better among younger voters. A Gallup Poll Aug. 5-7 found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading 54-40 among those under 30 years of age, while those over 50 went to Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> buy a 53-37 margin. Such a generational appeal is not a new idea. After all, Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, two baby boomers, made generational appeals in attempting to win their party's presidential nomination They lost out to the 54-year-old <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. There are four other potential benefits from the choice of Quayle: _ He is good on television. _ He may help in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, a Republican stronghold now under Democratic siege. _ He is a strong conservative. _ And, if you believe some Republicans, he might add a missing dimension to the ticket for women. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is one of the new generation of politicians who is comfortable with and looks good on television. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to be charitable, fails to communicate well through the video medium. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is `` extremely telegenic in this day of television and images.'' Republicans have been able to count on strong support from the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> for years, but the farm crisis has sapped that strength. It is a region that is up for grabs, for the Democratic ticket has no special appeal there either. The only drawback for the Republicans is that there is no evidence that the vice presidential nominee has a regional impact, as opposed to one in only his home state. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is also a conservative with a capital `` C.'' There are simply no obvious defects in his record from a conservative's point of view. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s good looks _ he has been called the Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> _ could be a plus as well, some argue. <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said that `` I ca n't believe a guy that handsome would n't be attractive in some respect'' to women But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s selection was immediately attacked by at least one group concerned with women's issues. `` With the nomination of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for vice president, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has essentially written off the women's vote,'' asserted <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has an extraordinary anti-women record in his tenure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. He is opposed to a woman's right to choose. He is opposed to the ERA. He opposes almost every program that has been advanced since 1980 that would enhance women's rights and women's well-being.'' Women are a big problem for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. According to several surveys, they hold negative views of him and support <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in far greater numbers than men. Whether <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> helps shrink the so-called gender gap or becomes of liability with women remains, of course, to be seen. A vice presidential candidate like <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> can help his party in a number of ways, but it is still the presidential candidates whom the voters are focusing on as they make their choice.

 Rallies calling for free elections in the Soviet-bloc countries will be held in 33 cities in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> on Aug. 23, the Toronto-based organizers said Tuesday. The International Black Ribbon Day Committee, founded in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> in 1986, said coordinated rallies also are planned in some Soviet-bloc cities but for security reasons the locations would not be announced until Aug. 22. `` We want Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to live up to the spirit of glasnost and allow free and fair elections starting at the municipal level,'' said committee founder <PERSON> Markus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>. He referred to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his policy of glasnost _ more openness in certain areas of Soviet society. The committee organized similar rallies last year on Aug. 23. That is the date in 1939 when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> reached a secret agreement in which the Soviets took over the Baltic states of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> with German assent. The Black Ribbon Day Committee has said rallies are scheduled in 14 Canadian cities; at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s City Hall; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Daley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaza </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrick </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>US Sends Aid to Nicaraguan Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 About six tons of U.S.-supplied food, clothing and tents have been sent to southern <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> over the past 10 days to assist a large group of Contra rebels and Nicaraguan civilians who have fled to that area, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the exodus reflects increased represssion by the leftist Sandinista government and the dire condition of Contra units that have been left without any means of resupply inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` The blocking of delivery of humanitarian aid by the Sandinista regime has resulted in severe hunger, disease and injury to some resistance fighters,'' she said. According to reports from the border area, more than 1,000 soldiers and civilians arrived there last week from a central Nicaraguan combat zone. Another group, estimated at about 2,500, is said to be en route to the area. The Contra leadership said the new arrivals joined about 8,000 combatants and 5,000 civilians. The assistance, part of $ 17 million in humanitarian aid approved for the rebels by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last March, is intended to help sustain the Contras through September. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved by a 49-47 vote a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> plan to provide $ 27 million in humanitarian assistance to the Contras in the new fiscal year starting Oct. 1. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans, who had sought military as well as humanitarian assistance, voted against the proposal.

 A mother who won a federal court battle to enroll her adopted, AIDS-infected, mentally handicapped daughter in public school will appeal the judge's order that the youngster remain isolated in a classroom booth. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 36, said he filed notice of appeal Tuesday. He said he plans to ask the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a speedy hearing, but is doubtful the case could be resolved before school starts Aug. 29. If it is n't, <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 6, wo n't be starting school as planned, he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> ruled last week that the <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> must admit the child to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> Exceptional Center to be schooled with her peers. The judge said the child would remain inside a plexiglass enclosure until she became toilet-trained and learned to stop sucking her thumb and forefingers. School officials objected, wanting her to remain on homebound instruction instead out of fear she could transmit the deadly virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. `` We were hopeful the judge's solution might work,'' <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said. `` But after talking with pediatric and psychological experts _ people whose judgments we respect a great deal _ we are convinced it would be very harmful, even to the extent of affecting her immune system.'' <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> is in the advanced stages of AIDS, which doctors believe she contracted from multiple blood transfusions following her premature birth in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. In a separate matter, Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a licensed practical nurse, was arrested Monday and charged with improperly obtaining $ 200 or more in government assistance in 1986. She was released on her own recognizance a few hours later. Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said she was unemployed when she and her husband separated. She applied for food stamps and then took a part-time nursing job without reporting the income _ about $ 100 a week or less _ to state officials, she said. `` No one wanted to take care of <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON> -LRB- her husband -RRB- was n't here and it was the only kind of work I could do. I figured that's not all that much money; it's not going to make that much difference.'' The welfare-fraud charge is a third-degree felony. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said prosecutors might let her participate in a first-offender program that would leave her with a clean record.

 Here is a transcript of the address delivered by Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the co-chairman of the Republican platform committee, to the Republican National Convention Tuesday night: Thank you very, very much. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, you are so special to me. Tonight, I want to tell you exactly who our Republican platform is for. Our platform is far, far superior to the one the Democrats cobbled together in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The difference is simple. Republicans share their vision with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. Democrats hide from the people. Last week, 106 women and men arrived here, here in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to construct the platform that reflects our party's deepest beliefs and aims. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to us last week and shared with us his vision on a whole range of issues that confront our country: keeping taxes low for economic growth, preserving peace through strength, fighting drugs and improving education. The vice president said that Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was the stealth candidate. Like the stealth bomber, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tried to hide himself and his positions from the people. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is right and the Democrats' platform proves it. You know, fellow delegates, you wo n't find some very basic words in the Democratic platform. Words like `` tax,'' or `` revenue,'' or `` unemployment.'' You wo n't find any mention of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, and you wo n't find words like `` church'' or `` synagogue. The Democrats want to hide their views from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people because they knew that if the people ever found out what they really believed, they would lose. They do n't want people to know that they are still the party that will raise taxes and weaken our defense. Let me give you one example of the contrast between our platform and Democrats' stealth platform. We say loud and clear what Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said so many times: We wo n't raise taxes, period. Higher taxes cost jobs. But the Democrats' platform does n't say a word about taxes. Why? Last month, there was a poll taken of the Democratic delegates. And that poll showed the Democrats' hypocrisy. Sixty-seven percent of the delegates favored a tax increase; but 65 percent said they wanted to keep it out of the platform. On issue after issue the contrast is clear _ Democrats say nothing. Or else they quote their views in empty rhetoric. But Republicans tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people exactly what we stand for and exactly where we will lead this country after we win November. We're for children's tax credits, to let the parents decide how their children will be cared for. We're for college savings bonds, to help families save for college. We're for aggressive action in the war on drugs, including mandatory sentencing for drug dealers. If any of you is still skeptical, we'll prove it to you. Just write the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and ask for a copy of the side-by-side platforms that I'm holding. Or you can write your local newspaper and ask them to print it, so that all the voters will understand that we are the party of opportunity and understand where the two parties stand. Fellow Republicans and Americans, I am very proud to represent the people of the state of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. People in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> are special people who provide us not only with the products of their hard work. But they are also a people who have a way of life that is based on sound values and common sense. Rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the heartland in more ways than one. The contribution of farming families to our country is not only economic but moral. For the values that are needed to be a good farmer are the same values that built <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Farmers have been through some tough and painful times recently. But at the same time, Republicans are optimistic about the future of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture. We reject the Democrats' idea of mandatory production controls. Instead, we know that farmers can return to prosperity if we will take a few basic steps. We want to open markets abroad. We will not use food as a foreign policy weapon. We want to find new uses for farm products. And Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken the lead here with his strong advocacy of alternative fuels like ethanol. And we want to keep our rural communities strong through the increased efforts at economic development. As a governor of a farm state, I know that the future of American farming will be secure with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> knows so little about agriculture that he told the farmers of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that they ought to try growing Belgian endive. Fellow Republicans, our platform presents a vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a vision that is optimistic and bold and daring. It reflects our pride in what we have done and our competence in what we will do. The Democrats missed their chance to level with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. We did n't and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will lead our party to victory in November.

 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> lists more than $ 250,000 in stock in a family-controlled newspaper group as his only substantial asset, but the figure could be higher because of the vagueness of congressional financial disclosure forms. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, picked by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to be his vice presidential running mate, listed the stock, and other holdings, on the forms filled out by all senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members earlier this year. The filing requirements are such that `` more than $ 250,000'' could mean several millions dollars worth of stock in <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. In fact, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s holdings are rumored to be worth far more than that, but the $ 250,000-plus category is the largest used for listing assets on the disclosure forms. Too, the `` more than $ 250,000'' figure is book value, which often vastly understates the actual worth of stock. Central Newspapers is the group with which the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> are affiliated. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s grandfather, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON>, was publisher of those dailies, as well as the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gazette </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s wife owns another block of Central stock with a book value of $ 100,000 to $ 250,000. Except for the stock in <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s only holdings last year were two retirement accounts totaling a maximum of $ 65,000; a bank account worth up to $ 15,000, and an account in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> credit union of $ 1,000 to $ 5,000. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> still holds the title of vice president and associate publisher of his hometown paper, the family-run Huntington -LRB- Ind. -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Herald-Press </ORGANIZATION>. That paper's owner, <ORGANIZATION> Huntington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, paid him $ 2,625 in director's fees last year, he reported. He listed three growth-fund accounts in the names of his children, totaling up to $ 45,000, and a bank account in the children's name worth between $ 1,000 and $ 5,000. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was paid almost $ 50,000 last year for giving speeches to a variety of contributors, ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> breweries to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cream </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator wrote several articles for pay, including two for $ 40 apiece that he sold to the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> papers. He wrote a $ 1,000 article for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> reported receiving honoraria totaling $ 49,255 for speeches and writings. To meet <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> limitations, he donated $ 14,302 of that sum to charity. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and Human Resources committees. Several of his paid speeches were to groups with a direct interest in the work of those committees _ a common practice among members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. For example, on March 18, 1987, he was paid $ 2,000 apiece for speeches to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Voluntary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a prime defense contractor, paid him $ 2,000 for a speech on April 9. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, an avid golfer, listed among his income last year a $ 250 trophy for participating in the <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> golf tournament.

Because the <PERSON> Pulliam </PERSON> company is privately owned, the value of its assets are n't disclosed.

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge Tuesday refused to remove a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> attorney as executor of <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>'s estate, rejecting the charges of the entertainer's sister and four associates that the lawyer had looted the estate. State District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> issued the ruling in the bitter, costly lawsuit after hearing four hours of closing arguments from lawyers representing the executor, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>, and the plaintiffs. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> was named as executor of the estate and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in a will signed 13 days before the entertainer's death on Feb. 4, 1987, of complications from AIDS. The plaintiffs _ <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s 74-year-old sister <PERSON> Angie </PERSON>, his housekeepers <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Luckie </PERSON>, longtime manager <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, his companion in the last six years of his life _ argued that <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was not competent to understand the will because of his illness. <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> countered that the five were just trying to squeeze more money out of the state. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> is to rule later on who will pay the legal fees, expected to run into the six figures. Defense attorneys have asked that the costs be paid by the plaintiffs, including <PERSON> Angie </PERSON> <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, who was left $ 594,000. In his closing argument, defense attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had taken the Liberace foundation, with $ 100,000 in assets at the time of the entertainer's death, and turned it into an $ 18 million entity through shrewd management. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Performing Arts had been a longtime dream of the flamboyant pianist. The foundation was formed in 1979 to provide art and music scholarships at 30 colleges and universities. `` Mr. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON>, as a dreamer, will have that dream live on forever,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON>, the plaintiffs' attorney, argued that <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had created a `` web of conflicts and deceit'' in getting <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> to put him in charge of the estate. He noted <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> standards say a lawyer should not consciously urge a client to name him as executor of an estate. `` <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> has become the largest single beneficiary of the Liberace estate,'' <PERSON> Gewerter </PERSON> contended. He said the attorney had been paid $ 500,000 in legal fees and was making $ 250 an hour sitting through the lengthy court proceedings. He charged that <PERSON> Stote </PERSON>'s actions were `` tantamount to robbing from a dead man,'' and said that his clients were not interested in getting more money out of the estate, but in removing <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> and recovering the money he has received in legal fees. <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> countered that the five plaintiffs in the case had become accustomed to the good life while <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> was alive, and wanted more out of the estate after his death, although each had been given more in the will drafted by Strote than in previous wills. `` Liberace dreamed a dream, then made it become a reality,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. `` The plaintiffs lived a dream but ca n't face reality. It's been said man must pay the fiddler. <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> chose to subsidize a whole symphony orchestra. Now they're saying ` Just give us control.''' `` <PERSON> Liberace </PERSON> signed that will knowing full well what he was signing,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. `` He gave the plaintiffs more benefits than they had before. But that was not good enough. They want control; control they never had in his lifetime. They lived a Shangri-la environment and they do n't want to lose it.'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON>'s efforts had netted the <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> nearly $ 2 million from an auction of the entertainer's memorabilia earlier this year, $ 1 million more than could have been realized if the items had been sold wholesale And he said <PERSON> Strote </PERSON> had been able to get an extra $ 500,000 out of <ORGANIZATION> Liberace </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> properties because of his tenacity at the bargaining table.

<HEAD>Young Indiana Senator Was Bush's `First Choice, Only Choice'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could hardly contain himself Tuesday as he listened to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> describe him as `` a dynamic young leader for the future.'' The youthful senator bounced up and down on his toes as he exulted in the spotlight many had hoped would settle on them. Only hours before, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, had been trying to arrange a tennis game. He also was scheduled to appear at a reception in his honor given by the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> delegation. He did n't show up, but no one minded. He suddenly found himself with more important business. The call came from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a few minutes after 2 o'clock. The Republican presidential nominee-to-be told the 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator he had made his decision on a running mate. Others received similar calls from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but he told them they were not his choice. According to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, the vice president told <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that `` he was his first choice, his only choice.'' Less than two hours later, they were standing together on the shore of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in short sleeves amd no tie, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in a dark suit and red tie. Taking his cue from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the steamy day, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> doffed his coat, momentarily struggling to pull his arms out of the sleeves. But then he hit his stride, his right hand chopping the air in a gesture reminiscent of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> believes and has the commitment to the American family that is so important to all of us,'' he said, his voice rising to a shout. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> understands the problems that confront us and can lead us to the future and the 21st century.'' With <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as he stood on the platform were his wife and their three children, the oldest 14. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reached <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> hotel. The senator is not a delegate. He said last week he was attending the convention only as a vice presidential prospect. But as the time dragged on and the speculation continued, he and wife began to express some doubts. `` The total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, an attorney. `` You know you ca n't just jump in the car and go to the store to buy a kid's swimsuit to replace the one with the hole in it.'' `` From a personal standpoint, if I had a time in my life to be vice president, I would n't choose this time,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> reporters. But at the same time, the senator said, `` If he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- makes the decision, I'll be there with bells on.'' A <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> look-alike, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was described by fellow Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> as `` extremely telegenic in this day of television and images.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was viewed as someone with `` appeal to baby-boom voters'' and an asset in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did poorly in several primaries.

<TEXT>
 Two young Americans emerged from more than 10 months of captivity in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle and told a news conference on Tuesday that they were well treated by their leftist guerrilla kidnappers. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> McLachan </PERSON>, 21, both of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, appeared before reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> following their release on Sunday. In taped remarks broadcast earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> McLachan </PERSON> were in a canoe in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> last October when they were captured by the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, a leftist rebel group. <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> McLachan </PERSON>, friends since high school, are geographers, but that apparently the guerrillas thought they were <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents. `` They always treated us well, although they had their suspicions about what kind of work we were doing. But talking with them we wiped out their doubts and they saw that we were innocent.'' The two men were released on Sunday to <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Serna </PERSON> <PERSON> Alzate </PERSON> in southern <LOCATION> Caqueta </LOCATION> state, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday in a news release. `` They -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- told us that we should stay calm and that nothing was going to happen to us,'' <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON> said in Spanish when interviewed by the Colombian radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION>. The two young men left last June on what was intended to be a six-month trip through <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Both were senior students in geography, <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McLachan </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In a statement <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON> read on behalf of himself and <PERSON> McLachan </PERSON> at the news conference, <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON> said they were captured Oct. 4, and not Oct. 8 as reported on the radio earlier in the day. Professor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Yuill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-Madison </ORGANIZATION> researcher who frequently travels to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, said following their abduction that the area where the men disappeared was `` a pretty inhospitable place, with yellow fever, political guerrilla camps, drug camps and a river that has a strong current, waterfalls and piranhas.'' <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON> said at the news conference: `` For the last 10 -LCB- months, we lived with a group of guerrillas at various camps in the jungle. Throughout the ordeal, we were treated well, eating the same food as our captors and living in the same kinds of shelters. `` We were provided with books, writing material and a chess set to pass the time. `` We suffered no serious health problems and are currently in fine health as the doctor here at the embassy confirmed today. `` We wrote several letters, but had no way of knowing whether or not they were being delivered. `` In the final weeks, we marched toward the northwest through the jungles. `` During this time an <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> acronym for <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- commander assured us the <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION> was working toward our release, but would not specify what was being done. `` We took this news with some skepticism, and remained hopeful the ordeal would end well.'' <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> McLachan </PERSON> were delivered to Bishop <PERSON> Serne </PERSON> <PERSON> Alzate </PERSON> `` who underwent considerable risk on our behalf.'' He said the guerrilla organization's decision to release them was `` on humanitarian grounds and no ransom was paid.'' <PERSON> Koneman </PERSON>, apparently refering to embassy warnings against making the jungle journey in the first place, said: `` We of course owe our most profound thanks and our humble apologies to everyone.'' He ended by saying, `` We will be traveling home in the next few days to be united with our families and friends in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' According to newspaper files in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, the two men said in a letter dated Sept. 22 that they were planning to canoe down the <LOCATION> Putumayo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which divides <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WLS </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that a letter sent by the two in May reached their parents in July, raising hopes then that they were still alive.

 Even before <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his choice of a running mate, aides were preparing to craft the words the mystery person will say while accepting the nomination. Speechwriters planned to write a `` generic'' speech that would be tailored at the last minute to fit the running mate, along with similar speeches to place that name in nomination. The name can be filled in later. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s convention manager, said the draft speeches would set out broad themes the campaign wants to stress on the convention's closing night, with the running mate to polish the language later. `` By Wednesday morning ... we will have one or two writers working on a generic kind of acceptance speech which the nominee would then have to take and modify and put into his or her own style of words,'' said <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>.

 AIDS would rank as the 15th leading cause of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it were counted as a separate category, according to new figures from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome killed between 12,450 and 13,820 Americans last year, the center estimated in its first annual summary including separate figures for the disease. While AIDS has not yet been added to the rankings of major causes of death published by the agency, the 1987 toll would have placed it 15th on the list, ahead of birth defects, the agency noted. The center's annual summary of vital statistics also disclosed that in 1987, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had the most births in nearly 25 years and the most deaths ever, and that marriage and divorce rates were at the lowest level in more than a decade.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened to $ 12.5 billion in June as imports hit an all-time high, the government said Tuesday. Analysts said the report showed how far the country still has to go in solving its trade problems. The gap between what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> exports and what the country imports surged by 28.5 percent in June, a major setback after three consecutive monthly improvements. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought to play down the significance of the one-month surge, but Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the figures were evidence of the administration's failed economic policies. Financial markets, which went into a tailspin the last time such a disappointing trade report was released, took Tuesday's report more or less in stride. While the dollar was hit by a wave of panic selling immediately after the report was released, it soon steadied and regained much of its lost ground.

 <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> could n't resist accepting the role of the businessman <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON> in <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON>'s new film, `` Tucker.'' It was a part that caught his dreams. `` I saw the possibilities,'' he said. `` Too often, I'm cast in things that are fairly one-dimensional.'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON>'s career has been anything but one-dimensional. He studied drama with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON>, appeared in <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chayevsky </PERSON>'s play, `` Middle of the Night,'' and starred in the long-running TV series `` Mission: Impossible. Now he's emerged as a mature character actor. He considers his work in `` Tucker'' something special. `` Tucker'' is based on the life of <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who designed an innovative automobile, `` The Car of Tomorrow _ Today,'' after World War II. The major car makers realized that the car was far ahead of it's time and conspired to make sure it never went into mass production because it would force them to start manufacturing autos with the same safety and productions values. <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON> was an elderly <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman who helped raise financial backing for <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s project. However, when the two first met, <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON> scoffed at the idea of the new car. `` I really wanted you to feel that there was no possible place to go after that first encounter,'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said. `` If you tell me your biggest dream and I laugh at you, that's the biggest insult in the world.'' <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON>'s cynicism eventually breaks down. `` Feelings he has n't touched in years he starts to touch,'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said. `` Attachment, love and the ability to dream again is given him. Everyone dreams when they're kids. <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> lost that. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> gives it back to him.'' The real <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON> was a private man, rarely photographed or written about. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> had to create much of the character by using his own instincts. `` I drew <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> the first couple of days,'' said the actor, once an illustrator for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` I saw this lonely <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessman who really has no family, no friends and no life outside of work.'' Fans of <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> will have to look hard to recognize him in `` Tucker.'' He wears a mustache in the film and walks hunched over, his head sticking out in front of his body. In reality, <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> is tall, clean-shaven and animated. `` I wanted <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> to be older than I am and shorter than I am. Every day I got a little older in rehearsal and a little shorter. I'm almost 6-3 and I figure <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> is about 5-10.'' Portraying <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON> reminded <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> of the men he knew while growing up in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> in the 1940s. `` When I stood in front of the mirror the first time _ when I saw <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> coagulate _ I saw my father, his friends, the uncles when I was young looking up at these guys,'' he said. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> credits <PERSON> Coppola </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Godfather,'' `` Apocalypse Now'' -RRB- with giving him the freedom to develop his character. `` Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you, that's a vote of confidence,'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said. `` Francis really creates a playground for you. The more you bring the happier he is.'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> represents <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s postwar optimism: sharply dressed, endlessly promoting, believing in a better world. <PERSON> Karatz </PERSON> is a product of the Depression. He gives off the impression of someone who has lived a hard life, doubting it will ever change. `` He's a guy that just misses being elegant,'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> observed. `` The suit is an expensive suit, it just does n't work exactly. He just misses being everything he wants.'' The theme of `` Tucker,'' one man against the `` system,'' recalls the films of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Capra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturges </PERSON>. <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> agrees that `` Tucker'' shows the influence of those directors, especially <PERSON> Sturges </PERSON>. `` In the middle of a serious scene -LRB- in a Sturges film -RRB-, you'd see a pratfall and it's OK. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> would allude to <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> I think it's a Capra type of story with a Sturges style. I liked that. Some choices were based on that feeling.'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> has taught acting for over 30 years. His students have included <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Oates </PERSON>. However, he downplays his own role in others' careers. `` You do n't teach acting. What you're doing, is saying you're an instrument. I helped them find stuff that was in their very being that they were not utilizing,'' he said. Acting comes down to a simple formula: `` It's laughing at the same joke everytime as if you'd heard it for the first time. If you can do that, you do n't have to work with me. The audience wants to believe that what's going on has never happened before.'' But to be a really good actor, something special is required. `` Anyone can walk and talk, that's easy,'' <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> said. `` There's not an actor in the world that wants to be bad. If you could create magic, that's what it's all about. The beauty of the theater or film is having a thousand people in the single room having the exact same experience. It means we're all the same.''

 The 20th season of PBS' `` Sesame Street,'' beginning this November, will lead up to the birth of a baby for <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON>, two of the characters who married last season. This season will also mark the 20th anniversary of two of the show's charter cast members _ singer-actor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON>, the man inside Big Bird. They recalled their beginnings on the now historic PBS children's series at a recent news conference. `` When I first heard about it, I did n't think I wanted to be involved with a new children's show, because there was nothing that exciting in terms of children's shows at that point,'' said <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON>, who had been featured on the <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> show and joined `` Sesame Street'' in 1969. `` But when I saw some of the film and animation that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> and some of the other people had done, I knew this was really something quite out of the ordinary from what had been on television before.'' The producers of the show expect to add new graphics and use more films, including ones by director <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Demme </PERSON> and photographer-artist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wegman </PERSON>, this season, a likely response to the trend toward multimedia kids' shows like `` Pee-wee's Playhouse. Guest stars will include <PERSON> Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rhea </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlman </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Galway </PERSON>, among others. One of the major episodes last season was the wedding of characters <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>. This season's finale will be the birth of their baby. the producers hope to see the baby grow up on the show. Producer-director <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said a search is on for expectant parents who would be willing to let the show follow their child's growth. Big Bird has become the show's biggest star, but he did n't start out that way, said <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON>. A peripheral character in the early episodes, he was sort of `` the village idiot,'' <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON> said. `` One day, I realized he was really a child,'' said <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON>. `` One of the scripts said he had to go to day care or something. So I said, we really should play him as a child.'' Big Bird came to embody `` all the fears of children and things they have to learn _ a wide-eyed view of the world,'' said <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON>. ` He gradually learned to read and write and so he grew from 4, which I felt he was the beginning, to 6 -LCB-, which is where he stays.'' <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON> carefully protects Big Bird's real identity from little children, but admits when he sees a child toting one of the big yellow dolls, `` I keep wanting to say, you know, -LRB- he goes into Big Bird's high voice -RRB- ` Hey, I do that!''' <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON> had been into puppeting since he was a child. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> had intended to have a career entertaining adults as a singer, but when rock music began to take over the business, he decided he would have to take another path. Both men said the rewards of working for children are great, though the task is sometimes exasperating. <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> does a lot of concerts and benefits as his `` Sesame Street'' character. Children, he said, `` are a wonderful audience. First of all, they're very, very honest. I had a little girl in <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> some years ago. I was shaking hands after a concert. She had me lean over to her and said -LRB- he drops to a stage whisper -RRB-, ` You know something, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>?' And I said, ` No, what?' ` Up close, you do n't look too good.''' <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> at least can appear as himself to children, though he is careful when they're around. `` I do n't walk on red,'' for instance, he said. <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON> has to be incognito, though he does have some fun. When he heard a mother call her child by name as the girl was examining a bunch of talking Big Bird dolls in a toy department, `` I bent down near one and said, ` Hello, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>. How are you? Is n't it a nice day?' The mother says, ` Those toys are remarkable! It even calls my child by name!''' `` I do n't do that very often. Usually I'm a nice guy,'' <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON> said. When children visit the set they inevitably will see the man get out of the bird suit at some point. But `` most of them will continue to talk to the puppet even though you're standing there holding it,'' <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON> also does Oscar the Grouch. On the way to a meeting with <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> to discuss the character, including what kind of voice it would have, a gruff <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cabbie barked, `` Where to, Mac?'' and a star was born. `` I do n't know who that cabbie was, but I'd like to thank him,'' <PERSON> Spinney </PERSON> said. Not all the characters have worked out, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> the Robot was canned. `` Professor <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> was a puppet that fell asleep as he talked. So did the kids,'' she said. <PERSON> Dina </PERSON>'s high-pitched voice `` drove parents from the room. A blind puppet did n't work. Professor <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbit </PERSON> was a full-size juggling puppet that `` looked hideous,'' she added.

 Ordinary folks always have had difficulty following the logic of applied economics, but activities of late have a good many of them standing on their heads. It is a time in which growth is said to endanger the general economic welfare, when job creation is declared inimical to the best interests of the nation and when busy factories are viewed with suspicion. Higher interest rates are praised because they make it harder to borrow, helping to supress the All-American urge to buy houses. Inflation, though mouse-sized, is said to have the destructive potential of an enraged elephant. The explanation for this peculiar economic attitude is likely to be even more puzzling, but the one common denominator fitting all the above is the widespread view that inflation is now the biggest threat to world stability. That view seems to be shared by heads of most central banks in the industrialized world, since they have been raising short-term rates in recent weeks. And in a global economy, one nation's move provokes another's. Inherent in fears of inflation, no matter in what nation it occurs, is the assumption that any economy can run amok if not reined in. In this view, economies are machines that, if run too fast, can burn themselves out. Therefore, `` good news,'' such as rising employment and greater industrial activity, is indeed good news _ but only to a limit. That limit is reached when the good news strains the machinery, producing the smoke of inflation. As always, economists now disagree on whether they see smoke. In fact, the `` growth is good'' school has not given up, contending that the way to overcome inflation and other economic threats is to oil the machine and go even faster. More jobs, for example, can mean more income, less debt, greater savings. More jobs can mean more government revenues, thus helping reduce the federal deficit and myriad social problems. More spending by business could mean bigger, more productive factories, reducing the chances of economic burnout. There appears to be no universal, fixed attitude toward any of these economic elements. Job creation is sometimes viewed as healthy; at other times, a threat. Capital spending often is viewed as anti-inflationary; at other times it is seen as a threat to economic stability. The various elements that make up the big economic machine move in relation to each other. Sometimes an element is seen as overly loose and in need of tightening; at other times, it is viewed as tight and out of synchronization. Many people will recall, for instance, that it was universally agreed a year ago that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would have to export more manufactured goods if it were to lower its imbalance of payments. It was considered imperative. Now that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories are turning out manufactured goods for export the warning is heard: The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have enough workers and capacity to serve both the domestic and overseas markets without courting inflation. Perhaps overly simplified, it comes down to a question of choice: Is it better to slow output to accommodate the limited capacity of the machinery? Or would it be a better resolution to build a bigger, better machine? Right now, the `` growth is bad'' school has the upper hand, mainly because it counts as members several of the world's central bank heads, including <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Headway Made in Al Aqsa Mosque Restoration 19 Years after Arson</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After 19 years of painstaking effort, workers are only now making headway in repairing the damage caused when an Australian sheep shearer set fire to <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> mosque, one of Islam's holiest monuments Precarious wooden scaffolding towers into the dome. Laborers are still cleaning fire-blackened stone behind the pulpit while skilled craftsmen are carefully reconstructing mosaic panels with inscriptions from the Koran, Islam's holy book. <PERSON> Isam </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, the Palestinian engineer in charge of the project, blames lost skills and modern politics for the slowness of the work. `` The fire damaged some of the oldest parts of the mosque. Suddenly, we had to work with gypsum, mosaics, stucco and lead. All these were lost skills, and we had to find people who knew and relearn them,'' said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who supervises a team of 40 workers. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON>, which marks the place where the Prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> ascended to heaven to receive the word of God, was built in the 7th century after the Caliph <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> conquered <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. It is considered Islam's third holiest site after Mecca and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. The 36-acre site known in Arabic as the <PERSON> Haram </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> -LRB- Noble Enclosure -RRB-, was originally the site of the Jewish Temple, built by King <PERSON> Herod </PERSON> and destroyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tenth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> in 70 A.D. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said the renovations for the mosque and the nearby Dome of the Rock have been slowed by the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. `` We have to be careful because of politics.'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> added that the recent decision of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to sever ties with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> put question marks on whether money would still be available for the restoration. He said more than $ 1.5 million had been spent so far on fixing damage from the fire. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said repeated strikes and boycotts by Palestinians protesting <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> made it impossible to complete the change from the mosque's gold-tinted aluminum dome to a new a reddish-hued copper top before rains start in September. Perhaps the greatest loss in the fire, which took hours to put out, was a carved wooden `` mindab,'' or pulpit, presented to the mosque by <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON>, the Moslem warrior who defeated the Christian Crusaders in the 11th century A.D. Replacing the pulpit requires special woodworking skills unavailable locally. A number of countries are vying for the honor of carrying out the work, but choosing one country over the other is proving to be a delicate political exercise. Officials of the Waqf, the Jordanian-funded Moslem trust that oversees the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> complex, said <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would probably be awarded the job of reconstructing the pulpit. On April 21, 1969, Moslem guards spotted flames coming from <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON>. The fire burned out of control for hours with flames reaching the windows just below the dome. Israeli authorities arrested <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohen </PERSON>, a tall blond sheep-shearer from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, who belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of God sect. He was judged insane and deported to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tahboub </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, questions whether the act was the work of a deranged individual. He said Moslem investigators believed a group may have been involved because <PERSON> Rohen </PERSON> called <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the night before the attack and may have received instructions. But <PERSON> Tahboub </PERSON> added, `` We refused to give evidence to the Israelis because we considered the court to be illegal.'' Much of the fire damage has now been repaired, including about 75 feet of Fatamid-style mosaics, 750 square feet of gypsum moldings, 30 new stain glass windows and new marble columns. The most painstaking work is being done by <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabari </PERSON>, 38, who said it took two months to place the 20,000 pieces of glass and stone in each square meter -LRB- 10.76 square feet -RRB- of mosaic. Some of his work represents new designs inspired by <PERSON> Jabari </PERSON>'s stay in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, where he was sent to study restoration methods and became enthused with the Sistine Chapel in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> `` I was inspired by the spirit of <PERSON> Michelangelo </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jabari </PERSON>. Cleaning fire-blackened stone and mosaic panels behind the pulpit, restoring some decorations in the <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Aqsa </PERSON> dome's interior and building a new pulpit remain to be done. Awad declines to predict when work will be complete, noting the mission has expanded to include other repairs needed because of age and neglect. `` It is a lifetime job,'' he said.

A momument to the military men was erected shortly after the war, but it was not until this summer that the civilian defenders got their monument.

 Palm trees and evergreens grow where once there was only ironwood brush. The once-countless rats and gooney birds are gone, the coral runway has been replaced. `` It's strange, everything looks so different that walking around here, looking at the monuments and the old rusted-out guns, it's almost like looking at someone else's life, like it never happened to me,'' says <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodds </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, a retired radio and television broadcaster. <PERSON> Dodds </PERSON> was a 22-year-old civilian construction worker captured when the Japanese invaded this remote tropical atoll in late 1941. He was one of the defenders of <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> who recently returned for a dedication of a monument in honor of the civilians who fought alongside the soldiers, sailors and Marines, all of whom were either killed or captured. A memorial to the Marines was erected shortly after the war. But the civilians _ including construction workers building military installations and others who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> _ got little credit. It was 1981 before they were deemed eligible for veterans' benefits, and for 47 years there was no official monument to them. The dedication ceremony drew 42 civilian defenders, 14 military men, and about about 100 family members. For many of them, the reunion June 13-16 was their first visit to the island since the war. <PERSON> Ival </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON>, 64, a retired construction contractor who lives in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, still has occasional nightmares about his war experiences. By bringing his wife, two sons and his 85-year-old father to the reunion, he hoped to put some of the old ghosts to rest. `` This has been a 47-year-dream,'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> said as he looked over the post he manned on the day of the first attack on Dec. 8, 1941. `` I just ca n't explain how I feel, but by having my family here I feel like they understand why I'm the way I am, why I did the things I did.'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> was 18 years old and a private in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> when he landed on Wake in late 1941. He still recalls the details of that first attack, only hours after the Japanese struck <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Wake is west of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dateline </ORGANIZATION>, so it was the next day there. `` We were n't prepared at all,'' says <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON>, who manned a 3-inch anti-aircraft gun. `` We had n't even filled the first sandbag. We ran to our positions and trained right on those planes, but we were expecting reinforcements and we thought they might be our own guys.'' The next 16 days were a blur of daily bombing raids, thwarted invasions and close-fought battles. The outnumbered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops shot down 21 Japanese planes and sank at least two destroyers with outmoded weapons salvaged from warships from World War I. But with no reinforcements and little ammunition, they surrendered to the Japanese on Dec. 23, 1941. The Marines were commanded by Maj. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON>, who was acclaimed the `` hero of <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>.'' During the fighting he was reported to have sent out the message, `` Send us more Japs.'' He later denied the story. <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON>, who served as a congressman from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> after the war, died Aug. 5 of pneumonia at age 85. `` We were among the last Marines to get the order to surrender,'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> recalls, `` and when we were told to give up our guns, well, that was the first time we ever told an <ORGANIZATION> NCO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- non-commissioned officer -RRB- ` up your bucket' because we'd been told the Japanese take no prisoners.'' The Americans were ordered to strip and march down to the old airstrip, where a ring of machine guns awaited. There they were tied up and ordered to crouch in the middle of the circle. `` We were scared and praying and crying and everything else,'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> says. `` Then at the last minute, they took the guns down, because they learned there were civilians among us.'' The Americans _ 449 <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, 68 sailors, six <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> men and 1,200 civilians _ were left on the airstrip overnight, still naked and tightly bound. The next day they were each given a small piece of bread and a drink of gasoline-tainted water. It was Dec. 25, 1941. `` That was our Christmas dinner, and we had no idea how much worse it would get,'' <PERSON> Milbourn </PERSON> recalls. Most of the prisoners were eventually transferred by boat to prison camps in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Several prisoners were beheaded and all were poorly fed along the way. The Japanese kept 98 civilians on the island as slave labor. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> `` Chick'' <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texarkana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, lied about his age to join the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> when he was 15 years old, so he had not even turned 20 when he was released from prison camp in September 1945, after the Japanese surrender. `` I got the name ` Chick' in boot camp because I was such a kid,'' says <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON>. `` In prison camp the older guys looked out for me, tried to get me food, because I was in my growing years.'' Across the atoll, the survivors, many of whom had n't seen each other since they were liberated from prison camps, gathered in little groups to compare experiences. They set off under the blazing tropical sun to find memorable spots; the bunkers, the old landing strip, the mass grave where the dead were laid to rest. `` That's what this trip is really about,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, 71, of <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cove </LOCATION>., <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who as a 23-year-old Marine sergeant was injured during the first attack `` It's been nearly 50 years, and we're pretty old now, but it was a heck of a fight and we still remember,'' adds <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who made the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> his career. Seeing the guys who helped get you through all those years in the prison camps, well, it just makes you happy to be alive.'' Of the Americans, 120 were killed in the fighting and 231 died in captivity. The 98 civilians kept on Wake were executed on Oct. 7, 1943. They left behind a reminder of their plight: a large coral boulder, painstakingly hand-carved with their initials and the still-legible message that reads `` 98 <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> PW -LRB- for prisoners of war -RRB- 5-10-43.'' Five months later, they were machine-gunned on the beach in retaliation for a devastating American air strike the day before. The memory of those civilians and how they died has haunted many of the survivors. `` When I heard about this trip I thought I was n't sure I wanted to go, I did n't know what kind of memories it would bring,'' said <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 67, now credit manager of a hospital in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The execution of the civilians `` affected me so profoundly that I could n't sleep for weeks after hearing about it. I thought it was a religious duty that I should come back.''

<HEAD>Rales Brothers Launch Hostile Tender Offer for Interco</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The board of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, target of a $ 2.69 billion hostile tender offer, likely will be hard-pressed to devise a restructuring plan attractive enough to keep shareholders from defecting, many analysts say. A <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based investor group launched a $ 70-a-share tender offer for the huge furniture and apparel company on Monday, a week after <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> directors rejected the proposal as inadequate. The bid is the first big-time takeover attempt orchestrated by the <PERSON> Rales </PERSON> brothers, who already have diverse manufacturing holdings but seek a major foothold in the consumer products industry. `` Seventy dollars is a fair offer, and it's important that the board give full consideration to fair offers,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` It's going to be difficult to come up with a plan that would be significantly more,'' he said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON>, a vice president at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Eppler </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guerin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said: `` The restructuring plan has merit, but I'm afraid it ca n't compete with a tender offer.'' <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped $ 2.12 -LCB- a share to close at $ 72.12 -LCB- in heavy trading Monday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, indicating investors are waiting for a higher bid or measures by the company to support the price. <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON> said he has valued <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> conservatively at about $ 70 a share, although some analysts have estimated <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> might be worth up to $ 78 a share. The tender offer pressures the <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> board to speed up its ongoing restructuring plan. In an effort to remain independent, <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> recently strengthened its defenses against unwanted takeover bids and began working on a plan that includes selling the company's flagging apparel operations and paying shareholders a special dividend. Analysts said the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-based </LOCATION> company's apparel operation, which includes the well-known <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Fog line, could fetch as much as $ 800 million. The Rales brothers have indicated in <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> documents that they also would sell the unit, as well as other operations, to raise capital for the buyout. The Rales brothers and their associates already own 8.7 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s 38.4 million common shares outstanding. The pricetag on the shares they do not already own is about $ 2.47 billion. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schepman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>, said the company had no comment on the hostile tender offer. While <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s apparel operations saw operating profits plunge 33 percent in the 1988 fiscal year as the retail industry slumped, other operations have shown impressive growth. Operating profits from <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s footwear operations, which include the Converse and <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> brands, jumped 77 percent over the previous fiscal year, and operating profits from furniture jumped 21 percent, the company said in its annual report. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> reported revenue of about $ 3.34 billion last year. In addition to its manufacturing operations, the company operates 201 home improvement centers, general merchandise discount stores, men's specialty apparel shops and specialty department stores in 15 states. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> already had been a strong force in the furniture industry with its <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Broyhill </PERSON> lines, but the acquisition of furniture maker <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> more than a year ago solidified its No. 1 position. Operating through <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rales </PERSON>, 37, and his brother, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, 31, initially approached the <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> board with a $ 64-a-share takeover bid. The group sweetened the offer to $ 70 a share but the <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> board derided the bid as inadequate. An acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> would give the Rales brothers their long-sought goal of an established place in consumer products. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for their acquisition group, said the brothers expressed an interest in consumer products as long as three years ago. But to date, the Rales' have confined their business interests to machinery and other non-consumer goods. Among the prizes of their acquisition efforts in recent years are <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pneumatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mohawk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Master </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Domestic car and light truck sales continue to outperform analysts' predictions, though Aug. 1-10 sales were 6.6 percent behind an incentive-fueled early August 1987 sales period. `` Sales in August and September last year were artificially high,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said Monday. Combined sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks totaled 277,952 for the nine selling days from Aug. 1-10, up from 264,588 in the comparable period last year, the automakers reported. There were only eight selling days in the 1987 period, and on a daily basis, sales were down 6.6 percent. Sales reached a 7.6 million seasonally adjusted annual rate, the same as in the preceding 10-day period, from July 21-31. In early August 1987, buyer incentives aimed at clearing excess cars from crowded dealer lots pushed the annualized sales rate during the period to 8.4 million, compared with the year-long 1987 rate of 7.1 million. This year, the Big Three automakers' inventories are hovering around a 60-day supply of vehicles, which the companies consider ideal, and the fire-sale atmosphere is gone, said analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sales are relatively strong, <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said, although compared to last August, `` They are going to be rather lackluster because we are comparing against an incentive period.'' `` Consumer confidence is high, gasoline is cheap, it's a boomy situation,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Healy </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold 86,676 cars from Aug. 1-10, down from 91,582 in the early-August 1987 period that was boosted by a cut-rate financing program, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Longridge </PERSON> said. Daily sales were down 15.9 percent from the year-earlier period. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> sold 52,239 cars, up from 49,402 a year earlier but down 6 percent on a daily basis. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold 24,167 cars, up from 17,568 a year earlier, a 22.3 percent jump in daily sales. August 1987 sales were slowed by dealer shortages of compact Omni and Horizon models after a plant conversion shutdown, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sold 44,650 light trucks, up from 41,959 in the year-ago period but down 5.4 percent in daily sales. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of 33,943 light trucks were down from 34,414, a daily sales decline of 12.3 percent. Chrysler light truck sales of 19,156 topped 16,621 a year earlier, a 2.4 percent increase. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> sold 9,531 U.S.-built cars, up from 8,421 a year earlier and up 0.6 percent in daily sales <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sales of 2,961 domestically built cars were up from 2,195 in the 1987 period, a 19.9 percent daily sales increase. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> sold 862 U.S.-made cars, up from 568 a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which began domestic production last September at Flat Rock, sold 709 U.S.-made cars.

<HEAD>South Korea Moving To Stem Insider Stock Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The South Korean government will computerize stock transactions of major individual and institutional investors in a tough step to stem insider trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The ministry said it would establish an independent division within the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- SSB -RRB- responsible for uncovering insider trading and making recommendations for legal action. The move, aimed at protecting investors and strengthening development of domestic financial markets, will take effect Sept. 1 after the necessary regulations are revised, a ministry spokesman said. If found to have engaged in irregular trading practices, violators will face legal punishment and firms committing irregularities will be obliged to publish an apology in daily newspapers, the ministry said. The <ORGANIZATION> SSB </ORGANIZATION> will use computerized data to list those with access to inside knowledge, such as securities trading by insiders who are director-class business officials, shareholders with more than 10 percent stakes, and other individuals and corporations with access to inside information, the ministry said. The government also will order officials at securities-related organizations to report signs of unfair trading to the <ORGANIZATION> SSB </ORGANIZATION>, the ministry said. The <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> automatically will start surveillance of the market when stock prices and trade volume fluctuate suddenly and notify the <ORGANIZATION> SSB </ORGANIZATION> of its opinion of the cause, the ministry said. The <ORGANIZATION> SSB </ORGANIZATION> will be authorized to trace the origin of unfair trading funds in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examination </ORGANIZATION> and notify the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of the probe results, according to the ministry. The ministry will rewrite the related laws and decrees to guarantee the rights of investors who have lost money through unfair trading practices such as price manipulation.

<HEAD>Dollar and Gold Rise Ahead of June Trade Figures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar rose slightly against most major foreign currencies in quiet European trading this morning as the market waited for the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for June. Gold prices also were slightly higher. Foreign exchange dealers attributed the dollar's rise to some last-minute dollar purchases by a few large banks ahead of the 8:30 a.m. EDT release of the trade report. `` The trade numbers will be the key in setting the trend of the dollar,'' said one dealer in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The dealer predicted that if the June deficit is similar or larger than May's $ 10.93 billion gap, the dollar will slide. But if the deficit is below $ 10 billion, the dollar will rise, though any rise could be checked by central bank intervention. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.13 yen to a closing 133.08 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted higher at 133.43 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8840 West German marks, up from 1.8810; 1.5832 Swiss francs, up from 1.5780; 6.3935 French francs, up from 6.3780; 2.1265 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1257; 1,397.00 Italian lire, down from 1,398.00; 1.2283 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2196 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7115 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7145 late Monday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 432.30 a troy ounce and at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 432.00. Both were up from Monday's late bid of $ 430.40. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 431.80, up from $ 431.00 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 41 cents to close at a bid $ 434.21. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.74 a troy ounce, up from Monday's $ 6.72.

<TEXT>
 The dollar edged up in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today while share prices closed slightly lower in slow trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained 67.78 points the previous day, shed 4.74 points, or 0.017 percent, to close at 27,896.55. Volume on the first section was 260 million shares, slighly up from Monday's 230 million shares, which was the lowest full-day level this year. The exchange's main index earlier in the day reached a low of 27,780.62 but rebounded later to erase most of the losses and close little changed. Securities dealers said the rebound was prompted in part by traders taking positions in electricals ahead of the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures for June later in the day in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Declining issues outpaced advancers 500 to 330. The dollar opened at 133.20 yen, ranged between 133.00 yen and 133.27 yen before closing at 133.08 yen, up 0.13 yen. Spot trading totaled $ 3.1420 billion, down from Monday's $ 3.9130 billion. Commercial bank dealers said there were no major moves in the day's thin and sluggish trading ahead of the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures.

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has issued an order allowing <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to seize computer components for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> radar and weapons systems from a small <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> company that shut down earlier this month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> issued the seizure order Monday after <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Armtec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and charged that the smaller firm might move or damage more than $ 1.17 million worth of components it manufactured under contract to <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. Armtec closed on Aug. 3, laying off about 80 employees, after <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> withheld a payment to the small contractor. In its lawsuit, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> claimed it found evidence it had been overbilled by <PERSON> Armtec </PERSON>. Both companies are being scrutinized in a federal probe of potential fraud and bribery in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s procedures for buying weapons systems. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> also charged that <PERSON> Armtec </PERSON> made out smaller final paychecks to its employees than provided for in an Aug. 4 agreement under which <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> would give the smaller company $ 66,000 to help cover the payroll in exchange for taking the components and raw materials it owns at the Armtec plant. Armtec president <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> and his wife, company treasurer <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, said they would not give <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> about $ 200,000 worth of assembled components because <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> had not paid its bills. `` They're not going to get the goods until they pay us our money,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. `` I will stand in the door at this building; we'll bar it up.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> denied the allegations in the lawsuit and said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> owed Armtec more than $ 400,000. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> lawyer who represents <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, said the company sought the seizure order to protect $ 151 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> contracts to build 14 Terrier Mod 10, three MK-92 and six <PERSON> Cort </PERSON> radar defense systems for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships. If the closed Armtec plant does not remain dehumidified, severe but almost undetectable damage could occur to the wiring harnesses produced there, decreasing the reliability of the final products, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said in court documents. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> over roughly a two-year period beginning in February, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has made fleet deployment decisions based on bringing some ships to port for installation of the new systems, the suit said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> met a requirement <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> imposed to post a $ 2.34 million bond in case it eventually loses its lawsuit against Armtec. Mrs. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said 10 of the close to 90 employees that lost their jobs Aug. 3 had been placed back on the payroll to complete work for <ORGANIZATION> Sikorsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, a defense contractor that did business with <PERSON> Armtec </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy continues to grow steadily in August as consumer spending and capital expenditures post solid gains, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly economic report. The report, released Tuesday, summarized recent economic figures for June and July, and concluded that strong domestic demand, both for consumer and capital goods, is helping to keep the economy steaming along even though investment in housing and public spending appear to have reached a peak. The report noted that demand for labor is showing a tendency to tighten, but did n't indicate any concern over wages rising or over inflationary pressure if they did start to rise. Central bank officials have indicated in recent statements they are watching the impact of wages on inflation closely. The report said domestic wholesale prices have risen slightly recently, but attributed the gains mainly to seasonally higher electricity rates. Commodities prices, meanwhile, are trending lower in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as imports are rising, while world commodities prices have been lower.

 Jury deliberations have begun in the complex lawsuit by a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company against <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> oilman <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> and his two younger brothers, accusing them of trying to corner the world silver market. The six-member civil jury was to resume weighing the evidence today. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> took about three hours Monday to instruct the jury on the law. The panel broke off deliberations about 4:45 p.m. EDT. The Hunts are being sued for $ 150 million by <ORGANIZATION> Minpeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, which claims that the Hunts manipulated world silver prices between 1979 and 1980 in a failed attempt to corner the market. The trial began at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> in February. <PERSON> Minpeco </PERSON>, a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian government, sued the three brothers _ <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 62; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 59, who also has extensive real estate holdings; and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, 56, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> _ and several <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> businessmen. Lawyers for Minpeco charge that the Hunts and their Middle Eastern co-defendants were responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $ 9 an ounce to more than $ 50 an ounce between September 1979 and January 1980. But the Hunts assert they bought silver because of unstable world political conditions and those conditions, such as the Soviet invasion of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the seizure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, drove up the price of silver.

 A defense contractor was fined $ 1 million and two executives received jail terms for selling the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> used jet parts as new. The company, <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, also was ordered Monday to pay the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> $ 987,000 in restitution. `` This kind of crime strikes at the very heart of our national security system,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Tashima </PERSON> said. `` The integrity of the defense contracting system depends on the integrity of the military procurement officers and the honesty and reliability of defense contractors.'' Consolidated's $ 1 million contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> called for new parts, but instead it supplied used, refurbished or altered parts for the military's A-7, F-104 and F-4 jets, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON>. The parts, which included a tail assembly for the F-104 and a key component of the A-7's stability system, were critical items, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fliers could have been killed if the parts were used, the prosecutor said. None of the parts were used in jets because they failed to pass military tests, <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON> said. Company executives said the parts were not deficient and would not have endangered lives. Vice President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Guy </PERSON>, 43, was sentenced to a year and a day in jail, fined $ 50,000, placed on three years' probation and ordered to perform 150 hours of community service, <PERSON> Fahey </PERSON> said.

 Stocks retreated broadly this morning after the government reported a sharply higher trade deficit for June. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit its lowest point in nearly three months on Monday because of interest-rate fears, was up 6.40 to 2,010.67 as of 10 a.m. EDT.

<TEXT>
 The nation's merchandise trade deficit jumped to $ 12.5 billion in June, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today in a report that weakened the dollar and pushed up interest rates. The larger trade gap raised concerns that the dollar would have to fall to make American-made products more competitive in world markets. In another report that raised fears of inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said today that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in July, the highest level since March 1980. The strength of the economy was reflected in the trade deficit, which rose partly because the economy consumed a record amount of imported products. The financial markets reacted with modest pessimism. Stock prices were broadly lower, although the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 6.04 points to 2,010.31 as of 11 a.m. EDT. The dollar lost more than 1 percent of its value against the Japanese yen, British pound and West German mark immediately after the morning report, but then trimmed nearly half its losses. Bond prices fell, pushing interest rates higher. Prospects for a falling dollar hurt bond prices by frightening away foreign investors. The benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond fell 17-32 point, or about $ 5.30 per $ 1,000 in face value, as its yield rose to 9.49 percent from 9.44 percent late Monday. The deficit was the worst since February's $ 14.4 billion, which triggered a 100-point plunge in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials when it was announced in April. While exports fell by 2.4 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted $ 26.8 billion while imports surged to an all-time high of $ 39.4 billion. On Monday, investors' concerns about inflation were fueled by a government report that industrial production rose in July at its fastest rate in nine months. The report issued Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> helped knock down stock prices as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 33.25 points to 2,004.27. Combined with its 81.61-point decline last week, the average is at its lowest point since May 27, when it finished at 1,956.44. The 0.8 percent increase in industrial output intensified economists' speculation that the economy was expanding too rapidly, leading to possible inflationary bottlenecks and higher wage demands. `` You still have this global interest rate pressure,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, head trader at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. International in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` That's why the market got whacked.'' The bond market showed less response than the stock market did Monday to the industrial production report. Analysts speculated that bond traders may have been focusing their attention on today's release of June merchandise trade figures The price of the benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond, which is highly sensitive to inflation speculation, edged down Monday as its yield rose to 9.43 percent from 9.42 percent late Friday. Some analysts speculated the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would take more steps to cool off the economy with higher interest rates, even though the central bank moved just last week to raise its discount rate to 6.5 percent from 6 percent. That is the rate the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to commercial banks, and is a key indicator of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s interest rate policy. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy-makers had a regular closed-door meeting scheduled today to review the economy's prospects and chart monetary policy for the next 1 -LCB- months. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the large July advance in industrial production was widespread throughout <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing industries and also reflected heavy demand for electricity during the summer heat wave. The 0.8 percent July advance was double the 0.4 percent June increase and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrial production has risen. It was the largest increase since a 1.1 percent rise last October. `` We are seeing an industrial sector that is surging under the impact of increased exports and higher capital spending,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON> said some of the strength in July was overstated, reflecting the increased electrical demand and some unwanted buildup in inventories. `` People ought not be frightened by these hefty industrial production numbers because the inventory buildup we have been seeing shows that there is still slack in the economy,'' <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Farmland Prices Will Rebound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> drought may have only a minor impact on the price of good farmland even though it has caused significant crop losses, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> economist says. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, an agricultural land economist, said he polled more than 400 professional farmland appraisers in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, asking them what effect the drought would have on farmland prices. `` The consensus that emerged from the responses was that if the drought has any impact at all it will only last one year, and might represent a short decline in land values,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said, in a statement released Monday. The value of prime farmland fell sharply during the first half of this decade, but <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said appraisers indicated a rally in the past 18 months. Asked if the prospect of low corn and soybean production because of the drought could stop that rally, the appraisers answered that any halt would be a brief one. `` These appraisers expect any loss to be made up by a rebound with a good crop in 1989, and then land prices will move to higher levels in coming years,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. In addition, stronger commodity prices resulting from the short crops and the reduction of the grain surplus will help the land market rally again, he said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> also pointed out that some economists expect interest rates to decline in the next few years and that, too, `` would tend to support stronger land prices.'' A temporary slump in land prices might tempt farmers to invest in more land and expand their operations, but <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> urged caution. `` Only when a farmer is financially capable and can pencil out, through revenue projections, the ability to pay for the land, should the farmer consider buying it,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. He also said the next rally in land prices will be unlike the one in the 1970s, which was fueled by inflation. During that rally, some farmers thought inflation would pay for the land, and they spent more on it that they ever could recover in earnings.

<HEAD>South Korean Commissioner Says American Businesses Slow, Lazy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 American companies are `` slow and lazy'' in their export policy compared with the more competitive Japanese, a South Korean trade commissioner told a trade development club. <PERSON> Young-Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunwoo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, praised the Japanese as being aggressive exporters who follow through with excellent customer services. `` Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies are less motivated than the Japanese in penetrating the Korean market,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is very competitive in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' American exports to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> increased about 25 percent last year to $ 8.7 billion. He said the increase was partly because of a reduction of trade restrictions and depreciation of the South Korean won in relation to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. However, growing South Korean exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have created a $ 10.8 billion trade surplus between the two nations which favors <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation conducts 39 percent of its export trade with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sunwoo </PERSON> said that when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> dropped trade barriers and added 560 new items to its import market, the Japanese took 40 percent of the new business while the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> got 9 percent. Besides having geographic and cultural advantages, the Japanese take time to learn the Korean markets and follow through with service, he added. `` Most Americans do n't know about the Korean market,'' he said. `` American businesses are slow and lazy, especially in the after-services.'' The Japanese service a piece of equipment in a day or two, but `` with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, it is impossible,'' he said. <PERSON> Sunwoo </PERSON> said American business needs to motivate its export marketing efforts and get to know South Korean businesses. He said large Korean trading companies are looking for American suppliers for machinery, chemicals, agricultural products, and electrical testing equipment. `` If possible, please try to make a joint venture with a Korean company,'' he said, adding that such ventures would help American companies gain a foothold in the South Korean market that also may be a link to markets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Government Attacked Over Japanese Car Import Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Swedish price control officials Tuesday attacked the government for suggesting restrictions on Japanese car imports. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a sharply worded letter that limiting Japanese imports would raise car prices, boost inflation and reduce freedom of choice for Swedish customers. The attack was in response to proposed restrictions by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s trade department, which claims Japanese car makers are redirecting exports to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> because of restrictions in other countries. The ministry dismissed the conclusions by the cartel office. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, home of <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> car makers, was one of the last countries in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with a free automobile market, the government department said. <PERSON> Per-Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundbom </PERSON>, head of the cartel office which is politically independent, told two newspapers that the government was `` shouting before the wolf has come'' by claiming the Japanese were swamping the Swedish market. Foreign Ministry official <PERSON> Lars </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalberg </PERSON> said that following talks in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in April, Japanese manufacturers were ready to voluntarily limit exports to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> for the rest of the year. `` We feel it was an admission by the Japanese companies that they have subjected the Swedish market to too strong pressure and have used the fact that <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> has the only open market,'' <PERSON> Stalberg </PERSON> said. He said Japanese manufacturers increased their market share in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> from 15 percent in 1986 to 25 percent during the first part of this year. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> are now among the top 10 importers. <PERSON> Stalberg </PERSON> denied allegations by opposition leader <PERSON> Bengt </PERSON> <PERSON> Westerberg </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> government was violating <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s traditional support for free trade. He said the government had `` taken no action ... only discussed a developement which we find disquieting.'' Japanese cars sold well here because they had a reputation for durability and were cheaper. A new Japanese small car cost about the same as a second-hand Swedish model. <PERSON> Sundbom </PERSON> said decreased competition would raise inflation, which is more than 6 percent and is nearly twice as high as most of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s trading partners. The <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said restrictions would not affect the Swedish-made cars as much as imports from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which go to the same small-car market. A <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> spokesman also said the Swedish giant had not suffered from the Japanese expansion and sales last year were up 14 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> sold a record 73,255 last year, twice as many as its nearest competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, said official statistics. <ORGANIZATION> Saab </ORGANIZATION> was the fourth largest seller in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state authorities today said they have seized up to 900 crab pots illegally placed in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> water by Canadian fishermen, and a local politician calls it a case of `` low-seas piracy.'' The pots contained more than 10,000 pounds of prime Dungeness crab, valued at about $ 25,000, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, a fisherman and <LOCATION> Whatcom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> councilman. The crabs were returned to <LOCATION> Boundary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> harvest for Dungeness crab closed last spring. About 850 to 900 of the traps were pulled in Saturday, Sunday and Monday, 600 of them on Monday, said Lt. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>. The pots were found about a half-mile to a mile south of the Canadian border, which cuts across the more than 10-mile-wide mouth of <LOCATION> Boundary </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` This is low-seas piracy,'' said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, who was among the fishermen who helped remove the pots. `` We've been hearing rumors about this for quite some time. Over the winter, our drag fishermen have been snagging Canadian pots'' in their nets. `` We've been telling state fisheries people all summer that there was a problem,'' <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> said. `` It's nothing to see a dragger return with 20 Canadian crab pots on the stern.'' Last week, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and state officials arrested three residents of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, suspected ofn a normal summer, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. `` What were living through now is the same thing we were living through in 1980,'' in terms of a natural disaster, he said. Normal death rates nearly doubled from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> east during a 1966 heat wave _ with deaths jumping to five times normal in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> _ according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging later reported that heat waves in 1963 and 1966 claimed a total of 11,000 lives. And a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> study found that hot spells in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1939, 1955 and 1963 each produced more excess deaths than any recorded natural disaster in that state, including the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake and fire of 1906. Those most vulnerable to heat stress are the elderly, who may already suffer various ailments, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> explained. Indeed, in 1980 the elderly made up 70 percent of the excess deaths in the hot weather, he said. `` Several factors contribute to this increased vulnerability to heat stress, including less cardiovascular stamina, heart damage, less responsive blood vessels, underlying diseases and a decreased ability to sweat,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aging committee reported. In addition, it noted, the elderly use more prescription medications, and many of those drugs can increase sensitivity to heat. Heat-caused deaths do not arouse the concern they should because a uniform reporting system has not been established, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. As a result, only classic cases of heat stroke get officially reported as heat deaths, and those amount to perhaps 200 in a normal summer and 1,500 to 1,600 in a hot summer like 1980, he explained. Still not attributed to the heat are the thousands of temperature-induced heart attacks, strokes and other fatal ailments. They are only measured later, when deaths in the hot years can be compared to more normal ones and the excess calculated. `` We have very accurate assessment of what crop losses are going to be, and it seems we are more concerned about corn than about our people. I think that's a tragedy,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. Death and illness are n't the only heat-wave related problems; heat affects work attendance and productivity, depending on the region. A five-year study by researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> found that hot weather increases work attendance in the Sun Belt but reduces it in other areas of the country. Attendance rates remain high in hot-weather cities where air conditioning is common at home, work and car, the study found. But rates drop off when the the weather cools slightly and workers want to engage in outdoor tasks and recreation. In northern cities, however, work attendance dips as people unaccustomed to hot, muggy weather lose sleep and suffer other discomfort.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit suffered a major setback in June, swelling to $ 12.5 billion, the government said today in a report that sent the dollar down sharply, although briefly, on foreign currency markets. The surge in the trade deficit, a sharp 28.5 percent worse than the revised May imbalance of $ 9.8 billion, came after three consecutive months of improving trade figures, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. June's trading shortfall was the worst since February's $ 14.4 billion deficit, which triggered a 100-point plunge in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average when it was announced in April. The impact of the June deficit figure, however, was far less adverse. The dollar initially fell dramatically against all major currencies in hectic trading, but within an hour recovered at least half of its lost ground. Likewise, stock prices were broadly lower at the opening of trading. After three hours of activity, however, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average had risen by more than 25 points. `` The initial reaction to the June trade figures was indigestion, but the more we chew on them, the better they taste,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investment house. <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON> said that the markets realized that the one-month rise did not interrupt what should be a substantial improvement in trade for 1988. In a second report today, the government said that American industry operated at 83.5 percent of capacity in July, the highest level in more than eight years. The 0.4 percentage-point jump from the June operating rate was also viewed negatively by financial markets because it heigthened concerns about growing inflationary pressures. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought to play down the significance of one-month's increase in the trade deficit, saying that it did not change the fact that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for all of 1988 will be sharply lower than the record imbalance suffered in 1987. `` This one-month jump in the trade deficit is not cause for alarm,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Monthly numbers will always be erratic and it is more instructive to focus on the long-term outlook.'' Analysts said the trade deficit has been a major blow to the dollar's stability this year and shows financial markets are still vulnerable to unexpected jolts from the monthly merchandise trade statistics. `` The June trade figure is a big disappointment and the implications are very scary for financial markets,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said that the trade figure would likely push the dollar lower, driving up the costs of imported goods and further intensifying inflationary pressures in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> The June deficit in merchandise trade was substantially worse than had been expected. Most economists had anticipated a deficit of around $ 10.9 billion, which would have matched the deficit as originally reported for May. The May imbalance was revised downward to $ 9.8 billion, making it the best performance since an $ 8 billion deficit in December 1984. Analysts said the markets were ignoring the better May figure to focus on the widening of the June deficit, which was seen as a disappointment because of a big jump in imports and a drop in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. Exports fell by 2.4 percent in June to a seasonally adjusted $ 26.8 billion while imports surged to an all-time high of $ 39.4 billion. The deterioration pointed up the problem facing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy-makers, who have struggled for most of this decade to find ways to reduce soaring trade deficits. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports have shown improvements because of a substantial decline in the value of the dollar, imports have stayed at stubbornly high levels despite the fact that a weaker dollar is now making foreign goods more expensive for American consumers. The 5.7 percent jump in imports in June was laid to a sharp rise in imports of clothing, office equipment and heavy machinery. The report said that shipments of foreign capital goods shot up by $ 900 million in June while shipments of consumer goods rose up $ 700 million. The weakness in exports reflected declines in shipments of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> capital goods, agricultural products and autos. Even with the deterioration, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for the first six months of the year was running at an annual rate of $ 140 billion, down sharply from the record deficit of $ 170.3 billion set in 1987. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign oil bill declined slightly in June to $ 3.6 billion, compared to $ 3.9 billion in May, as the average price per barrel fell to $ 16.19, down 21 cents from May. An average of 7.36 million barrels of oil were imported daily, down from 7.76 million barrels daily in May. As usual, the largest overall deficit was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 4.4 billion, up from $ 4.1 billion in May. The deficit with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest trading partner, climbed to $ 1.40 billion. The deficit with the countries of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> rose to $ 1.9 billion while the deficit with the newly industrialized countries of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> rose to $ 2.7 billion in June.

<HEAD>London Shares End 8.5 Points Higher</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES with 2 final grafs</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices finished higher Tuesday, as a stronger start on Wall Street lent a helping hand to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities. Dealers said market players ignored the release of worse-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures and chose to wait for additional economic reports due later in the week. Most <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equity players were uninterested in doing much ahead of the release of British money supply and bank lending figures on Thursday and Friday's release of the British retail price index, which are seen as far more important in determining the near-term outlook for British interest rates and equities. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 8.5 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,825.3. Volume was a very light 346.6 million shares, little changed from Monday's 346.0 million shares. Players were heartened by a strong showing on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average was up 17.07 points at 2,021.34 as the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session finished. Little trading took place in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Tuesday morning as the market waited for the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report for June. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the deficit widened sharply to $ 12.5 billion in June from a revised $ 9.8 billion dollars in May. The markets had expected a $ 10.6 billion June shortfall. Dealers said the market chose to overlook the worse-than-expected June figure because it was tempered by a downward revision in May's gap, originally reported as $ 10.9 billion. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was up 7.7 points at 1,473.3 at the close. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index rose 3.92 points to close at 1,042.80.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday that is will not drop its challenge to the proposed merger of the Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper soft drink companies, even though the plan has been scrapped. The two firms announced merger plans in June of 1986 and were promptly challenged by the commission, which contended the combination would reduce competition in the production and sale of soft drinks. The companies subsequently abandoned the merger plan and asked the commission to dismiss its administrative complaint against them. However, the agency announced that it had voted 2-1 to continue the action, in which it is asking a court to require Coca-Cola to apply for permission from the agency before acquiring stock in any soft drink company for 10 years. The case was sent to an administrative law judge for consideration.

<HEAD>Dayton Hudson Says Earnings Up; Penney Has Earnings Drop; Zayre
Posts Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Three of the nation's largest retailers reported Tuesday they had varying degrees of success in maintaining second-quarter earnings as consumers continued to spend at a sluggish pace. <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose 24 percent during the quarter ended July 30 as the company kept tight controls on expenses. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported its income dropped 21 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Zayre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> posted a substantial loss <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> said it earned $ 28.6 million, or 34 cents per share, compared with $ 23 million, or 24 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue increased to $ 2.69 billion from $ 2.31 billion a year ago. `` We planned conservatively for the quarter and, despite a weak retail environment, our operating companies executed their plans very well,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Macke </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` We are particularly pleased with the profit performance of <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON>'s and are confident that its turn-around is progressing,'' <PERSON> Macke </PERSON> said. Problems with <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON>'s apparel stores drained <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> profits in past quarters and made the company a takeover target for <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> a year ago. The Dart bid failed in the wake of the stock market crash. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> reported second-quarter income of $ 81 million, or 61 cents per share, down from $ 103 million, or 68 cents per share, in the second three months of 1987. The company reported revenue of $ 3.21 billion, down from $ 3.41 billion a year earlier. The retailer attributed the earnings drop to the increased level of markdowns that apparel retailers have been forced to take during a year-old sales slump. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> said it also had higher development costs for ventures including video home shopping, but said its results benefited from a lower tax rate. The nearly $ 22 million loss reported by Zayre came as no surprise after the company warned earlier this month it had suffered a substantial loss during the second quarter. The loss compared with earnings of $ 77.3 million, or $ 1.29 a share, in the second quarter of 1987. The year-earlier results included an $ 89.6 million gain from the sale of part of Zayre's interest in its <ORGANIZATION> TJX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> apparel division Zayre attributed the loss in the latest quarter to its flagging discount stores division, which lost sales after it cut back on promotions. The discount stores also were forced to take larger-than-expected markdowns, <PERSON> Zayre </PERSON> said in a statement. The retailer's second-quarter revenue totaled $ 1.55 billion, up from $ 1.4 billion. For the first six months, <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings were $ 59.3 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with $ 61.1 million, or 63 cents per share, for the first half of 1987. Revenue for the first half increased to $ 5.24 billion from $ 4.46 billion a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> operates 599 department, specialty and discount stores in 37 states. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> said it earned $ 212 million, or $ 1.57 per share, during the first half, down from $ 239 million, or $ 1.59 per share, in the same period a year earlier. The 1987 figure includes a $ 140 million charge for the relocation of <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s headquarters to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. First-half revenue totaled $ 6.39 billion, down from $ 6.63 billion in the first six months of 1987. Zayre reported a six-month loss of $ 17.4 million, compared with earnings of $ 118.9 million, or $ 1.99 per share, a year earlier. The 1987 figure includes the gain from the <ORGANIZATION> TJX </ORGANIZATION> sale as well as a $ 20.5 million gain from an accounting change. The company had first-half revenue of nearly $ 3 billion, compared with $ 2.7 billion for the first six months of last year.

 The stock market discarded an unsettling report about the trade deficit and advanced this afternoon in moderate trading, nearly erasing losses of the previous session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit its lowest point in nearly three months Monday on anxiety over higher inflation, was up 27.20 points to 2,031.47 as of 2 p.m. EDT. Broader market indicators also rose. Brokers said the government's report this morning of a $ 12.5 billion trade deficit in June initially hurt the market because it was much higher than expected, depressing the dollar's value and pushing up interest rates. But the stock decline presented buying opportunities to some investors, and that helped the market recover in what brokers described as largely a technical bounce. At the same time, many Wall Street analysts remained skeptical about the immediate future for stocks. `` In my opinion, the market still has to go through some pain here,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president and manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

On the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market-value index rose 0.84 to 294.67.

 <ORGANIZATION> DeLaurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, left floundering by a string of box office flops, on Tuesday filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. The move had been expected since Friday, when the company founded by Italian producer <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON> revealed it had failed to negotiate a debt swap with bondholders that it had termed essential for survival. The company _ maker of the movies `` Crimes of the Heart'' and `` Weeds'' and the TV miniseries `` <ORGANIZATION> Noble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' _ has sold assets and sought to restructure its debt in order to survive. The company has n't reported financial results for 1987, but has announced estimates of a $ 69 million loss. The Chapter 11 filing begins a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding in which present management continues to operate the company, under the supervision of a federal bankruptcy judge, in an attempt to pay creditors and reorganize the company. Filing of the petition immediately puts a company's debts on hold. In announcing the filing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, the company did n't list assets and liabilities. The debt swap offer that failed last week would have dramatically reduced the company's $ 65 million bond debt by trading existing bonds for stock and bonds with terms more favorable to <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON>. The company has n't revealed how many of its bondholders agreed to accept the offer, other than to call the response disappointing. Sale of <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON>' library of 300 films, including `` The Graduate'' and `` Carnal Knowledge,'' to British financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> brought $ 54 million in July.

 Lawyers met privately Tuesday to plan strategy on behalf of farmers in 10 states who accuse <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> of reneging on its duties to pay drought insurance claims. `` It's just an organizational meeting in an effort to have a united front, which is the only way to go,'' said <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, who organized the meeting. He declined to elaborate on the discussions. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> issued an order Monday granting class-action status to lawsuits against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, allowing eligible farmers nationwide to join a group legal action against the <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, N.J.-based company. Farmers still can pursue independent litigation. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>'s action expanded his decision last week to grant the class-action status to three <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> claims against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> also is conducting hearings to investigate how Chubb policies were marketed within the state. Some of the farmers' lawsuits also name as a defendant Good Weather Agriculture, a California-based agent for <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said. The farmers say <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> sold them drought insurance on their crops, but has reneged on its duties to pay their claims as a result of the ongoing drought damage. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has offered to repay farmers twice the amounts they paid in premiums, but state insurance regulators have termed the offer insufficient. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> has maintained its innocence. In recent weeks, the company has taken out full-page newspaper advertisements nationwide to say that it has a long-standing reputation for business integrity. The company says it initially intended to underwrite $ 30 million in drought insurance, but a last-minute flurry of applications resulted in potential liabilities of more than $ 400 million. <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Korkuch </PERSON> did not return a telephone message Tuesday seeking further comment. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, who helped obtain the judge's class-action declaration, said an estimated 8,800 farmers in 10 states could have claims against the company. He said the farmers involved are in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said he hopes the case can go to trial in three to four months if a settlement is not worked out. `` Our only interest is full and fair compensation for the plaintiffs,'' he said. Last week, some <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> farmers suggested that they might pursue their own suits against <ORGANIZATION> Chubb </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Abaray </PERSON>, a lawyer on <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>'s staff, said last week that she persuaded lawyers for the <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> farmers to support the class-action lawsuit.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees, armed with a federal court order, began removing $ 1.7 million in military components from <ORGANIZATION> Armtec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION> Tuesday under the watchful eyes of three federal marshals. While the packing and loading operation took place, about 25 former <ORGANIZATION> Armtec </ORGANIZATION> employees, who lost their jobs when <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> canceled its contracts with Armtec, picketed outside, carrying signs reading, `` Armtec Is Quality,'' `` Unisys Pay Up,'' and `` Jobs Not Welfare.'' Both Armtec and <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> have come under scrutiny in a federal probe of potential fraud and bribery in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> weapons contacts, and <ORGANIZATION> Armtec </ORGANIZATION> shut down earlier this month. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> ordered the seizure Monday after <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, citing national defense and $ 151 million in federal contracts, asked the judge to order Armtec to surrender materials owned by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> lawyer who represents <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, said he action was taken to protect <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> contracts to build 14 Terrier Mod 10, three MK-92 and six <PERSON> Cort </PERSON> radar-defense systems for <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is under contract to deliver the completed systems to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> over roughly a two-year period beginning in February, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has made fleet deployment decisions based on bringing some ships to port for installation of the new systems, the suit said. The <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit claims that <PERSON> Armtec </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> lawyers last week that it would not turn over the materials because <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> owed it money for work already performed. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said it feared that if the closed Armtec plant did not remain dehumidified, severe but almost undetectable damage could occur to the wiring harnesses produced there, decreasing the reliability of the final products, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said in court documents. The issue came to a boil when <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> notified <LOCATION> Armtec </LOCATION> on Aug. 3 that it would no longer buy the wiring harnesses and other materials from <LOCATION> Armtec </LOCATION>. Actions by <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> forced the fledgling defense contractor to close its doors and lay off 88 workers.

 The stock market discarded an unsettling report about the trade deficit and rallied this afternoon in moderate trading, erasing losses of the previous session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which hit its lowest point in nearly three months Monday on anxiety over higher inflation, was up 30.05 points to 2,034.32 as of 3 p.m. EDT. Broader market indicators also rose. Brokers said the government's report this morning of a $ 12.5 billion trade deficit in June initially hurt the market because it was much higher than expected, depressing the dollar's value and pushing up interest rates in the credit markets. But the dollar later recovered, interest rates eased and bargain hunters entered the stock market, helping it recover in what brokers described as largely a technical bounce. At the same time, many Wall Street analysts remained skeptical about the immediate future for stocks. `` In my opinion, the market still has to go through some pain here,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>, senior vice president and manager of institutional trading at <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid slack export demand and forecasts for showers and cooler temperatures in the Corn Belt later this week. Corn futures prices fell nearly 10 cents a bushel, the permitted daily limit. The corn market was the leader in a session that featured relatively light trading and wide price swings in the soybean pit. Soybean futures, which are limited to moves of 30 cents a bushel, have recently provided direction to the grain markets. But soybeans lost traders Tuesday to the lower-risk corn pit, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, a grain analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Despite a record-melting heat wave that threatens further damage to the drought-stressed soybean crop, Freed said speculators shied away from the soybean market when prices for near-month delivery approached $ 9 a bushel Tuesday morning. Meteorologists predicted cooler temperatures would begin moving into the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> on Thursday. The forecasts, plus a lack of substantial export business, left the markets with little bullish news. `` It's still a bullish market, but it's a market that has trouble finding itself on days like today,'' Freed said. At the close, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 3 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.90 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 4 -RCB- cents to 9 -RCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.87 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 9 -RCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.78 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 21 cents lower to 20 cents higher with August at $ 8.66 a bushel.

 Organizers of a new venture involving the weekly television supplements of 33 newspapers announced plans Tuesday to challenge popular TV Guide in a battle for advertising revenue. The venture, called <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, groups the newspapers in an effort to attract national entertainment advertising with rates competitive with TV Guide's. It is a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, an independent agency that represents newspaper publishers. Representatives of TV Guide did n't have an immediate comment on the move, but some analysts said the newspaper organizers have carved themselves a daunting task. `` TV Guide is going to be a tough competitor; it's not easy,'' said <PERSON> Rodd </PERSON> <PERSON> Macklin </PERSON>, a financial analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. The Sunday television supplements now carry little national TV advertising because it is too complicated and time-consuming for the networks to deal with ad representatives of each individual newspaper, the organizers said. `` It's been inefficient to buy,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Under the new scheme, networks will be able to buy space in a number of TV supplements by doing business with a centralized operation. The move comes on the heels of publishing tycoon <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s purchase of TV Guide, announced last Monday, as part of his $ 3 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Triangle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION>. The venerable weekly TV publication is the most widely read magazine in the country, with a circulation of around 17 million and advertising revenue of more than $ 162 million in the first half of the year. `` We felt the timing for <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> was right because of the growing fragmentation of the television viewing audience,'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. `` When you realize that TV Guide ... only reaches 20 percent of the potential audience, it is not difficult to understand why there is room in the marketplace for additional national advertising alternatives.'' TV Guide also has been challenged in recent years by guides aimed directly at cable television subscribers. The Cable Guide, the largest of the pack, has a circulation of about 7.2 million and is expected to fetch some $ 35 million in ad revenue this year. `` TV Guide's had a lot bigger threats over the last five years'' than the one mounted by the newspaper group, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Network and studio advertisers will likely start advertising in the newspaper sections as a supplement to _ not a replacement for _ their promotions in TV Guide, he suggested. The 33 newspapers comprising <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> have a total circulation of 18.8 million, compared with <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION>'s 9.4 million in the same markets, the organizers said. Only television-related advertising will appear in the newspaper supplements, while TV Guide carries ads for other kinds of products in addition to promotions of TV programs. A full-page, black-and-white ad in the TV Week Network supplements will average around $ 70,000 _ about the same or slightly less than TV Guide charges, <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said. TV Guide currently charges $ 88,900 for the same type of ad, according to <PERSON> Julianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the magazine. Advertisers will have up until 18 days prior to publication to place the ads, close to TV Guide's 17. The newspapers in the group include the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>.

The rest, because they are located close to existing <ORGANIZATION> Hechinger </ORGANIZATION> stores, will be rented out to other retailers. `` Stop and <PERSON> Shop </PERSON> was only willing to sell the leases as a package,'' <PERSON> McMillan </PERSON> explained. `` But the locations are very lucrative, and a number of retailers have already shown an interest in renting in these locations.'' The agreement did not include the purchase of any inventory, fixtures or other <ORGANIZATION> Bradlees </ORGANIZATION> assets by <ORGANIZATION> Hechinger </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hechinger </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Richard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, co-chairmen of the chain of do-it-yourself retail home improvement centers. <ORGANIZATION> Hechinger </ORGANIZATION>, which is based just outside the nation's capital, has 73 stores operating on the eastern seaboard and will expand by about 32 percent with the transaction. `` The growth of the area in terms of number of homes and household income makes it one of the prime markets for do-it-yourself retailing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hechinger </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.

Young, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer, scared investors with gloomy comments in June about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> orders in the third quarter, the effects of higher prices for scarce dynamic random access memory chips and a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> freeze on certain orders. The higher cost of DRAM chips led to a price increase of up to 25 percent for some of <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s computer memories in July. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to report its third-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Cuhney is forecasting a 24 percent rise in revenue for the third quarter and profits of 87 cents per share versus 57 cents per share last year. That's a little higher than most other forecasts. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Canin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hambrecht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the market is worried <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic bookings wo n't match last year's record $ 1.19 billion <PERSON> Cuhney </PERSON> said he expected a 3 percent rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> orders and a 34 percent rise in foreign orders. `` Just to be up 3 percent on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side is a major accomplishment, considering the strength of last year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales in the third quarter.'' As it approaches the half-century mark, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> is stepping up its assault on computer giants <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> while using a $ 1.5 billion hoard to invest in small companies and buy back stock. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> agreed last week to buy 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Octel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a voice-messaging firm in <LOCATION> Milpitas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for about $ 27 million. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> said it had formed a partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION>. Both were relatively small deals, but indicative of <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s move away from its traditional base in scientific instruments. `` Those are strictly strategic moves and do n't mean the company is going on a buying binge,'' <PERSON> Cuhney </PERSON> said. Adds <PERSON> Canin </PERSON>: `` For all intents and purposes, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> is a computer company today with a very impressive line.'' Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> announced several changes in its top-level management to reflect the rising importance of its worldwide computer business, which accounted for $ 5 billion of the company's $ 8.1 billion overall revenue last year. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> is expanding in all directions, making terminals, personal computers, engineering workstations, networks, laser printers, software and minicomputers while maintaining its reputation for quality medical and scientific instruments. <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> even brought in former <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelers </ORGANIZATION> quarterback <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradshaw </PERSON>, teammate <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Swann </PERSON> and Coach <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Noll </PERSON> for a football rally-type talk to nearly 800 salesmen. Young bet the company a few years ago on the promise of Spectrum, which is based on a technology called Risc, or reduced instruction-set computing. Risc relies on much fewer circuit elements than traditional designs, such as <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s Vax, and should make it easier for <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> to engineer compatible Spectrum models of different sizes. The technology also gives users more bang for the buck. In its 49th year, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> has added about 1,000 engineering, marketing and sales personnel to reach 83,000 workers worldwide. That's still about 1,000 workers less than its 1985 peak, when the company trimmed down with voluntary severance and retirement programs to cope with an industry slowdown.

 Bargain-hunting investors rescued the stock market from another decline Tuesday, boosting prices in a moderate rally that overcame the effects of bad news about the nation's swollen trade deficit The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which fell 33.25 points Monday to its lowest close in nearly three months, recovered about half the loss by the end of trading, up 17.24 to 2,021.51. Broader market indicators also advanced. Brokers called the rally largely a technical reaction to the market's recent declines based on fear of rising interest rates, which erodes the relative worth of stocks. Between Aug. 3 and Monday, the Dow average had fallen 129.79 points, raising the prospects for at least a partial rebound. Stocks, bonds and the dollar's value initially fell when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported a larger-than-expected June trade deficit of $ 12.5 billion, which suggested the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency would have to decline to make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products more competitive and discourage <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s relentless appetite for imports. But the impact of the trade report was reversed by investors who quickly stepped in to buy stocks when prices reached what appeared to be bargain levels, brokers said. `` I would describe this as a technical bounceback from an oversold condition,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothe </PERSON>, managing director and head of over-the-counter trading at the Baltimore-based brokerage <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the stock market followed the behavior of the dollar and bond markets, which also rallied after an initial decline on the trade news But she remained skeptical about the immediate outlook for stocks. `` Now the question is, do we continue from here or do we come crashing back down or go down a little bit?,'' she said. `` I do n't know the answer to that. In composite trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, advancing issues outnumbered declines by about an 8-to-5 margin, with 884 up, 579 down and 509 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> floor totaled 162.79 million shares, up from 128.56 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 188.08 million shares. Among prominent blue-chip stocks, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rose | to 115 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -RCB- to 90 -LCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 \ to 60 | and <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -RRB- to 48 <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> added ~ to 43 -RRB-.

 <ORGANIZATION> DeLaurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been struggling for months after a string of movie flops, on Tuesday sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws. The move had been expected since Friday, when the company founded by Italian moviemaker <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON> revealed it had failed to negotiate a debt swap with bondholders that it had termed essential for survival. The company _ maker of the movies `` Crimes of the Heart'' and `` Weeds'' and the television miniseries `` <ORGANIZATION> Noble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' _ has sold assets and sought to restructure debt in order to stay in business. The company has n't reported financial results for 1987, but has released estimates of a $ 69 million loss. <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON> himself, who owns 61.9 percent of the compnay's stock, stepped down from management in February <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, declined comment through a spokesman. Under Chapter 11, the company continues to operate under supervision of a federal bankruptcy judge, in an attempt to pay creditors and reorganize. Filing of a Chapter 11 petition immediately puts the company's debts on hold. In announcing the filing in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the company did n't list assets and liabilities. After coming to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the early 1970s, <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON> was responsible for several movie successes, including `` Serpico'' and a remake of `` King Kong,'' before taking <ORGANIZATION> DeLaurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> public with a stock offering in March 1986. The company produced such box office non-starters as the $ 25 million `` Tai Pan'' and the $ 21 million `` <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lives </ORGANIZATION>,'' a sequel to the `` King Kong'' remake. An attempt to promote `` Million Dollar Mystery'' by entering moviegoers in a million dollar sweepstakes failed to bring in box office gold. Another company strategy was to sell videocassette and pay-TV rights to a movie before it was released, in hopes of reaching the break-even point before a movie hit the theaters. But the advance revenue often did n't cover advertising and distribution costs, which can run as high as the cost of producing a movie. `` I am profoundly saddened to hear that DEG has been forced into bankruptcy,'' <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON> said in a news release. `` I sincerely hope ... the company can be revived for the benefit of the shareholders, creditors and other investors.'' The debt swap offer that failed last week would have dramatically reduced the company's $ 65 million bond debt by trading existing bonds for stock and bonds with terms more favorable to <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON>. The company has n't revealed how many bondholders agreed to accept the offer, other than to call the response disappointing. Sale of <PERSON> DeLaurentiis </PERSON>' library of 300 films, including `` The Graduate'' and `` Carnal Knowledge,'' to British financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> brought $ 54 million in July. The company earlier sold its share in an Australian film distributor for $ 7 million. The company previously announced an agreement for a new line of credit with the European bank <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyonnais </ORGANIZATION>, but did n't reveal the amount. The bankruptcy filing does n't include <ORGANIZATION> DeLaurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Onyx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company's newly formed production company. Also unaffected by the filing is an affiliated limited partnership, <ORGANIZATION> DeLaurentiis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>.

 The dollar made an impressive recovery against major foreign currencies Tuesday, overcoming the negative impact of a wider-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for June. Gold prices finished lower after rising in the Far East and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid price for gold of $ 428.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 432.35 late Monday. The dollar plunged in hectic trading after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that the trade gap widened to $ 12.5 billion in June from a revised $ 9.8 billion in May. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency fell as low as 1.8600 West German marks but later bounced back and advanced steadily. By the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar had rebounded to 1.8893 marks, up from 1.8805 marks late Monday. Analysts said that after a closer look at the June trade report, dealers were heartened by the downward revision of the May figure from the previously reported $ 10.9 billion shortfall. The dollar also was bolstered, traders said, by a recovery in bonds and stocks, as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials advanced 17.24 points to 2,021.51. `` That absolutely had an effect,'' said <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, chief currency dealer in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>. Some traders said the strong buying interest in the dollar likely would establish a solid base for the currency in the near future. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Dipple </PERSON>, chief dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francaise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exterieure </ORGANIZATION>, said the dollar's comparatively muted response to the trade report indicates the market now moves more in reaction to interest rates than economic indicators. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.13 Japanese yen to close at 133.08 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 132.85 yen. By the end of trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency had jumped to 133.73 yen, up from 133.32 yen late Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.7190 to buy one British pound, more expensive than $ 1.7145 late Monday. Later, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound was quoted at $ 1.7037, cheaper than late Monday's $ 1.7145. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5870 Swiss francs, up from 1.5790; 6.4035 French francs, up from 6.3760; 1,399.45 Italian lire, up from 1,394.75; and 1.2275 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2270 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday: 1.8705 West German marks, down from 1.8810; 1.5705 Swiss francs, down from 1.5780; 6.3390 French francs, down from 6.3780; 2.1065 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1257; 1,384.50 Italian lire, down from 1,398.00, and 1.2275 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2196. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 431.25 a troy ounce, compared with Monday's late bid of $ 430.40. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, gold was higher, closing at a bid $ 433, up from $ 431 late Monday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 41 cents to close at a bid $ 434.21. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery fell to $ 428.90 a troy ounce from $ 433 late Monday. Silver bullion prices rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where the metal traded at a late bid price of $ 6.77 a troy ounce, up from Monday's $ 6.72. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver for current delivery dropped to $ 6.610 a troy ounce from $ 6.757 late Monday.

<HEAD>Silver Futures Plummet In Trade Gap Reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Silver futures prices plunged Tuesday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, falling about 15 cents a troy ounce amid speculation that a widening in the nation's merchandise trade deficit was not necessarily inflationary. On other markets, crop futures mostly were lower; livestock and meat futures were mixed; oil futures slipped; and stock-index futures advanced. Analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s morning report that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade gap had jumped to $ 12.5 billion in June after narrowing for three consecutive months initially was viewed by precious-metals traders as a harbinger of higher inflation. Accordingly, gold and silver futures opened moderately higher in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But the market later turned around as traders began focusing on the fact that exports dropped slightly, which analysts said apparently indicated that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industrial production was not expanding as rapidly as many had believed. That could mean the threat of higher inflation may be less than many had feared. The dollar, which initially had weakened on the trade news, reversed its course in mid-afternoon and the metals quickly followed suit, led by silver. The trade deficit figure `` does n't give you the impression the economy is very hot,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, chief trader of precious metals with <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said another government report showing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories operating last month at 83.5 percent of capacity _ a nearly 8 -LCB- - year high _ could be viewed as inflationary But the notion that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would raise interest rates further to combat inflation overshadowed the factory report and minimized its impact on the inflation-sensitive metals markets, he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, director of research with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the rise in imports noted by the report could reduce some of the capacity pressure on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories. `` If you look at the trade figure, it's not as inflationary as the initial reaction to it might have seemed,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. Gold settled $ 4.10 lower across the board with the contract for delivery in August at $ 428.90 a troy ounce; silver was 15 cents to 15.4 cents lower with September at $ 6.635 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid slack export demand and forecasts for showers and cooler temperatures in the Corn Belt later this week. The corn market finished sharply lower and was the leader in a session that featured relatively light trading and wide price swings in the soybean pit. Intense heat hit Midwestern croplands again Tuesday but meteorologists predicted cooler temperatures would begin moving into the region by Thursday. The forecasts, plus a lack of substantial export business, left the markets with little bullish news. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 4 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 3.90 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 5 -LCB- cents to 10 \ cents lower with September at $ 2.87 a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 10 cents lower with September at $ 2.77 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 21 -LCB- cents lower to 5 cents higher with August at $ 8.65 -LCB- a bushel Cattle futures finished mixed while pork futures mostly were lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Expectations of slackening demand for beef offset strong bullish fundamentals, including higher cash cattle prices and an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> showing an unexpectedly large number of feedlot-fattened cattle sold for slaughter last month, said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .72 cent lower to .45 cent higher with August at 70.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with August at 81.95 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .63 cent lower with August at 47.17 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .63 cent lower to .22 cent higher with August at 33.87 cents a pound Oil futures prices declined in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in advance of an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report released after the market's close. The report showed crude oil stocks fell by 3.6 million barrels, gasoline inventories rose 1.5 million barrels and distillate stocks rose 1.4 million barrels in the past week. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 15 cents lower with September at $ 15.49 a barrel; heating oil was .19 cent to .37 cent lower with September at 44.03 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .22 cent to .30 cent lower with September at 46.11 cents a gallon.

 Striking autoworkers and management of <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s AM General Division stayed away from the bargaining table Tuesday in the second day of a strike at two military vehicle assembly plants. Both sides said there would be no immediate resumption of talks to end the walkout that began when a contract extension expired at midnight Sunday. But a union leader and a company spokesman said a long strike could prove costly. The action has idled nearly 1,400 workers and halted production at plants in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, where military trucks are assembled, and in neighboring <LOCATION> Mishawaka </LOCATION>, which produces the Hummer, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s multi-purpose light vehicle <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fluke </PERSON>, the financial secretary of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> 5, said the strike was not related to AM General's decision last month to close the South Bend plant and eliminate 400 hourly jobs and 150 salaried positions. Workers agreed to a six-week contract extension in late June; talks broke off Sunday night. `` Obviously, we're unhappy about the plant closing, but we did n't negotiate from that basis,'' said Fluke. `` It's not a get-even type of thing.'' AM General President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said the plant would be closed because the division could not afford to compete for new truck contracts in the 1990s. <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> is protected from its creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws. <PERSON> Wilbur </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, the local's unit chairman, said a federal mediator might be called if talks remain stalled. He said the two sides remain divided over wages, severance benefits for workers losing their jobs, and `` just a lot of things.'' AM General spokesman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Nab </PERSON> said management would continue to follow its policy of not discussing the negotiations that began in April. Mac Nab said an extended strike could jeopardize AM General's chances of winning a renewal contract for the Hummer The division's reputation as a reliable supplier of military trucks to foreign buyers could also be hurt, he said. Earlier this monthy, <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a second-quarter net profit of $ 157.6 million, up 28 percent over 1987. The 1988 quarterly statement included a $ 30 million, one-time charge for the shutdown of the South Bend plant. The earnings of <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION>'s missile and electronics group, which includes AM General, dropped nearly 50 percent over the second quarter of 1987, earning $ 12.9 million on sales of $ 403 million. The company earned $ 23.2 million on sales of $ 407 in the 1987 quarter. The decline was due to falling military truck sales, the company said. The Dallas-based corporation's steel unit also operates a factory in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pan Am Renews Threat to Sell Assets, Union Official Says</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has renewed its threat to sell some of its assets in the wake of stalled negotiations between the ailing airline and its biggest union, a union official said Tuesday. In a meeting Tuesday with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said the carrier will sell its <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> routes, according to union spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> made the statement during a meeting in which negotiations broke down on a new <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. The talks ended in deadlock, and the union plans to file for federal mediation on Wednesday, <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the talks. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> would confirm only that the meeting took place. Last Thursday, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> voted by a large margin to reject a contract agreed on in July by the union's leadership and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> management The move dealt the airline a major setback in its efforts to cut labor costs. The proposed <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> contract had called for a wage freeze in return for <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> withdrawing its earlier threat to sell assets. The airline, engaged in sporadic talks with the Transport Workers since February, originally had sought a 10 percent cut in wages. In Tuesday's meeting, <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said the company would consider any alternatives to the rejected wage freeze, but they still had to achieve <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s goal of saving $ 81 million over the next three years, <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 265.3 million last year, believes it needs about $ 540 million over three years in pay cuts and other concessions from its unions to turn itself around. The unions representing pilots and flight engineers have agreed to cuts totaling about $ 240 million over three years, and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> is seeking $ 90 million in wage reductions from its flight attendants. The company has imposed $ 35 million in cuts on employees represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, under federal labor rules.

They want contracts modeled on one reached early this summer with <ORGANIZATION> Bohemia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, which restores wages and benefits over four years. <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> mills affected by the agreement are in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in Independence, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Elgin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>; in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Goldendale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>; and in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Emmett </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and Cascade. The regional strike by the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and by the International Woodworkers of America-U.S. began June 6. It ultimately spread to major companies including <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Other major regional wood products companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, were threatened by walkouts The unions settled last week with <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, and 1,275 workers returned on Monday to their jobs at 13 Willamette mills in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>.
