 Teachers pressing stalled contract demands defied threats of withheld paychecks and gave out students' midyear grades on union report cards Friday rather than report them to the school district as required. The action came after weeks of student demonstrations supporting the teachers and amid talk of a possible teacher strike. Meanwhile, a state mediator organized a weekend meeting between the union and the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District. A union spokeswoman said the `` vast majority'' of teachers at junior and senior high schools refused to report grades to the school district, as required by school regulations. District spokeswoman <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said 69 percent of the high school teachers did not turn in grades. The school system's tally for junior high teachers was not completed by Friday night, she said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers-Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> printed up 400,000 report cards to give to students, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>. `` Both members and non-members are participating,'' <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> also said the union agreed to a state mediator's urging that both sides in the long-running dispute meet Sunday. On Thursday, union President <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> called for a negotiating session between just the seven school board members and seven union officers. But the meeting Sunday will include the district superintendent and the district's chief negotiator. The union action on grades involved the 117,477 students in junior highs, the 119,904 students in senior highs, and secondary students among the 27,000 students at so-called magnet schools and centers, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. High school seniors have been concerned that the action would affect their university applications, but <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said those students have been told to take the union report cards to their counselors for forwarding to universities. The spokeswoman said both <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> university systems and the Ivy League schools have said the grades will be recognized. The contract covers 26,000 classroom teachers and about 6,000 librarians, nurses, counselors and other certificated employees, <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said. Of that 32,000, about 22,000 are union members. The teachers have been without a contract since June. The union has been seeking a 12 percent pay hike while the district offered about 17 percent over three years. Current salaries range from starting pay of $ 23,440 to a maximum of $ 43,319. The average salary is $ 36,600. Total district enrollment from the elementary level through high school is more than 594,000.

 The February Freeze spread Thursday to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states, while wind and cold lingering in the nation's heartland and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> endangered livestock and crops and made venturing outside hazardous A band of freezing rain extended from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; heavy snow was reported in parts of the central <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION>; and wind-chill readings hit 75 below or lower in parts of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The cold and snow led to a short workday for state workers in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, unexpected school and university holidays in several states and highway accidents. Ranchers reported that newborn calves were dying in the cold, and citrus growers took precautions to keep the deep freeze from harming their crops. The misery stemmed from an ocean of cold air that poured down from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> early in the week, after a shift in the jet stream. By midday Thursday, its effects in the Lower 48 were being felt across a vast, roughly triangular area from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, areas that had enjoyed in many cases their warmest January in years. Bostonians enjoyed a record-high 66 degrees Wednesday. Twenty-four hours later, the city shivered in 31-degree air, and light freezing rain was falling. In <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, which continued to post the lowest temperatures outside <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> sent all non-essential state workers home Thursday. The capital, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, grappled not only with the bitter cold but with a train derailment and explosion that forced the evacuation of thousands of people and disrupted electrical power. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s two largest universities shut down through the weekend. `` It's not the cold, because we've been open in much colder weather,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Tietz </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Bozeman </PERSON>. `` It's the wind chill we're concerned about.'' Classes were canceled at many <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> schools because of the wind chill and blowing snow. Schools also were closed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and elsewhere. Temperatures overnight dipped to 34 below in three <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns: <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lewistown </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Cut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>; and their wind-chill readings were as low as 78 below. In Billings, the record low for a Feb. 2 used to be 13 degrees below zero; on Thursday, it went to 28 below, and 20 below was the high for the day. In all, six record lows for the date were posted, including <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, with 18 above; Casper, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, 27 below; and <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, 28 below. But temperature records at the other end of the scale, though not so widespread as on Wednesday, also were racked up Thursday. Nearly 30 record highs were set, including <LOCATION> Asheville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 76 degrees; <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 74; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 80; <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, Va. 80; <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 78; and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 80. In <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, temperatures remained in the cellar near the Canadian border but warmed up elsewhere. Early Thursday it was 37 degrees at <LOCATION> Adak </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, and 59 degrees below zero at <LOCATION> Northway </LOCATION>. At least four traffic fatalities were blamed on the weather, and in <LOCATION> Edmonds </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a 35-year-old utility worker died Thursday when he fell while trying to repair a downed power line. In <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, a 50-year-old man was found dead Thursday morning in a vacant lot. <LOCATION> Bennett </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Chief Deputy Sheriff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said the man's death apparently was caused by exposure. The overnight temperature in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> was about 25 below zero, with a wind chill of 60 below. The man `` fell down and you could see where he struggled in the snow to regain his feet, but he was unable to do so,'' <PERSON> Dillon </PERSON> said. But a life was saved in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, when searchers Thursday found a 16-year-old boy who got lost Monday while driving to his family's farm. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> of rural <PERSON> Egeland </PERSON> was coherent but `` too wrung out to show any emotion'' aside from saying `` I'm thankful that I'm alive,'' said volunteer rescuer <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> The boy, who had only light clothing and car mats to keep him warm, had badly frostbitten feet and hands and was hospitalized in stable condition. Overnight temperatures in the area had plunged to 30 degrees below zero. Heaviest snow was reported in the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, reported 6 new inches by midmorning, while 11 -LCB- inches were reported in northern <LOCATION> Larimer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and 4 inches at <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. Snow also fell in the upper <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. In northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, snow blanketed the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION>, dusted <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area mountains and fell over beachfront communities. Freezing rain extended as far south as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and forecasters said there was a chance that below-freezing temperatures could extend to the southern part of the state by the weekend. Nervous citrus growers in south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, still recovering from a devastating freeze in 1983, were taking precautions, officials said. `` As people have been leaving my store today I've been telling them to go to church Sunday and pray for us,'' said <PERSON> Mardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> from her family's <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> citrus farm, <ORGANIZATION> Eggers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acres </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranchers said cattle were giving birth to calves that died from exposure within hours. One rancher, Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingham </PERSON>, said he lost two calves. `` We had one up and nursing, and came back and that big 100-pounder was dead,'' <PERSON> Ingham </PERSON> said. `` It's the wind chill out on this prairie.'' Workers at Double M Farms feedlot near <LOCATION> Kearney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, put acetylene torches to some water tanks for cattle, part-owner <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. They also had to stir the cattle feed so it would n't freeze Power outages blamed on the weather were reported in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, theorized that a power line contracted so tightly in 58 below wind-chills that it just snapped. Still, there were signs that people were getting used to the weather. `` A lot more people are staying home,'' <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, police spokesman <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Groepper </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Traffic was definitely lighter today ... -LRB- and -RRB- I think people have just adjusted more to the weather.'' Forecasters said the deep freeze would last for at least a few more days in most affected areas.

<TEXT>
 In the mining town of <LOCATION> Carletonville </LOCATION>, officials voted this week to erect a fence to keep blacks off the civic center's lawn. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, a mob of whites threatened to kill an Indian man who hoped to be their neighbor. Near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, a blond, 5-year-old boy was expelled last week from an all-white nursery school. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> was `` a lovely and intelligent boy,'' the principal in <PERSON> Kraaifontein </PERSON> said, and he was legally classified as white, but he could not stay because his mother had mixed racial ancestry. Practices like these pervade South African society. What sets the country apart, however, is not the existence of racism, but the fact that it is permitted, even mandated, by many of the people in power. When right-wing whites resegregated parks in the city of <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> last year and blocked the Indian man from moving into their neighborhood last weekend, they were scolded by the government and the press. But they had the law on their side. Employers face no penalties if they hire according to race, but colorblind landlords face heavy fines. Government schools must practice segregation, and private schools are entitled to do so. Municipal governments are empowered to bar blacks from parks, buses or beaches. `` The racists and bigots will exploit laws as long as they remain on the statute books,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Currin </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s government has spoken out against racism with increasing frequency in recent years. In November, it banned a small white-supremacist group, and it has outlawed the incitement of racial hostility. `` If apartheid means ... racial discrimination and encroachment on human dignity, then I reject it out of hand,'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said in 1986. But rarely is the government's rhetoric accompanied by tough action. The recent banning of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> has not been followed by steps against the larger, more powerful <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, despite its white-supremacist ideology, Nazi-style symbols and paramilitary training programs. Nor did police disperse the mob that gathered Sunday outside a house in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Mayfair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> district </LOCATION>, draped a noose over a wall, and shouted threats at the Indian who planned to move his family into the white neighborhood. `` Years of forced separation and years of racist indoctrination have resulted in people behaving in such abominable ways,'' said The Sowetan, a black newspaper, in a subsequent editorial. Information Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said in an interview that the Mayfair West incident could have happened in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The government was conducting a `` campaign of persuasion'' to diminish white racism, he said, `` but if you overdo that, you create a reaction.'' `` The eradication of racism from a society is a very complicated, long-term undertaking, as evidenced by the American experience,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said. `` Compared to 10 years ago, we've made tremendous progress.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> described <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>'s expulsion from nursery school as `` very unfortunate.'' `` When one lives in a society in a state of change, there is a gap between morality and legality,'' he said, noting that the principal acted lawfully. The government says blatant racism will worsen <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s international isolation, but it refuses to outlaw segregation of local facilities or residential areas `` Unfortunately, the government is unable to act decisively in such matters,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper. Prosecuting non-whites who live in white areas would `` create racial tensions at home and damaging publicity abroad,'' it said this week. But if the government scrapped the Group Areas Act, `` it would lose its constituency.'' Racism is practiced most enthusiastically by extreme-right whites, who Thursday launched a whites-only rugby league. But bigotry exists in relatively liberal neighborhoods as well. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s wealthy northern suburbs, where most voters back anti-apartheid candidates, doctors willing to treat black servants ask them to use separate waiting rooms. Neighborhood newspapers in those suburbs carry ads for `` European-supervised'' plumbing or electrical services. Readers know this means that if blacks come to their house to do repairs, a white man will be in charge. Despite the entrenchment of racial divisions, many South Africans are working to overcome them. Church groups have sponsored workshops in which whites stay overnight in black townships, while blacks live with whites. Several multiracial private schools are flourishing. <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON>, the mother of the expelled nursery school student, said she will seek out one of these schools for her children, `` where they will realize that they are equal to and no better than any other child.''

 Satirical cartoonists have launched a scathing attack on Buddhism and superstitious rituals such as fortunetelling, which are enjoying a resurgence after 40 years of communist suppression. `` Today you will suffer financial losses,'' a fortuneteller in one cartoon intones as he holds a customer's palm in one hand and takes a hefty fee with the other. Another shows a man with a bad leg going from temple to temple to pray for healing and finally being carried into a hospital on a stretcher. More than 120 such cartoons were part of an exhibit called `` Away With Superstition and Ignorance,'' shown this week in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and four other cities. Cartoonist <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said the artists timed the show for just before the Feb. 6 celebration of the Lunar New Year, traditionally one of the most superstitious dates on the Chinese calendar. Setting off firecrackers, still popular on the holiday, originally was intended to scare away evil spirits. `` We have a mission to help educate people,'' <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> said. `` It's not just a matter of people losing money to witch doctors and fortunetellers, it's also a problem of increasing the scientific spirit.'' The rebuilding of temples and the worship of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> gods also come in for heavy attack. One cartoon shows a man answering the telephone in a government office and telling the caller that all the officials have `` gone to the front line.'' `` Where exactly?'' `` To the Dragon King Temple to burn incense,'' comes the answer. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiuqiao </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popularizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, which helped organize the exhibit, said it often is hard to separate religion from superstition. `` Religion often uses superstitious elements, for example, if it claims to be able to cure people who are ill,'' she said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says it allows freedom of religion. But it is more tolerant of Christianity _ which most Chinese see as alien _ and other minority religions than it is of Buddhism, which has deep roots among the Chinese and greater potential to spread. Religion and superstition played a large role in daily life in pre-Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, especially in the countryside. Omens were seen in everyday events _ such as a crow passing overhead _ and people consulted diviners before making important decisions. Single women made offerings at `` maidens' temples'' in hopes of finding good husbands, and married women prayed to other gods for sons. The communists quashed most such practices after taking power in 1949. But the rituals have enjoyed a comeback recently as the government has relaxed controls and peasants have acquired more money. In the prosperous southeast, rice fields once again are dotted with small ancestral shrines and tombs newly built by peasants or renovated after decades of neglect. `` After they build a new house and buy a washing machine, -LRB- rich peasants -RRB- have nothing else to spend money on so they rebuild the family shrine,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said. `` Also, they want to show their gratitude for their wealth and ask the gods to keep the government from changing its policies'' of allowing some private industry. The official media often complain that building shrines and tombs wastes money and land, and call diviners and witch doctors cheats. All were targets at the cartoon exhibit, which drew about 24,000 viewers during an eight-day showing at the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Art Gallery in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. One that drew chuckles from viewers showed a spiritualist telling a fearful family that their goat, chicken and TV set harbored evil spirits. The spiritualist loaded them onto his cart and set off, calling cheerfully, `` Now I have all the evil spirits.'' Others took swipes at the new fad of computerized fortunetelling, touted by its hawkers as scientific. Customers feed their birthdate into a computer and get a printout with their fortune. `` We just came to laugh; hardly anyone in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> believes in these things,'' said a young woman who giggled over the cartoons with her boyfriend. Ms. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> agreed most city dwellers are n't as superstitious as rural residents. But she said even in the cities people are turning to old beliefs because of a crisis of faith in the government. During the 1960s and 1970s, she said, `` people developed the habit of worshipping Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> -LRB- Tse-tung -RRB- as a god. Now they do n't have <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> so they look for other gods.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> minister <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> appeared Thursday at the racially troubled <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> and angrily told Jewish protesters they had no right to call him a hate-monger. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> told an audience of 2,000 that he did not come to the college to pit blacks against Jews, but he said blacks learned how to hate from the hatred directed at them. `` To those Jewish students who see me as a <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, as a hater, I wish you life, I wish you life. I do n't wish to see any human forfeit his life,'' said the leader of the Chicago-based Nation of Islam. But, <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> added, `` Your people taught us to hate ourselves for years, and you have a hell of a nerve to see me today and call me a hate-monger.'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> said whites should leave blacks to solve their problems themselves. `` If the Jewish students come together to work out some family matter, we should n't call that racism,'' he said. `` No one outside the family should dare to interfere with our family problems.'' He said more separation between the races is needed to combat black feelings of inferiority. `` We do n't need a bedroom relationship with white people, we want a boardroom relationship. Perhaps some other time we might want to entertain some social contacts.'' <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> added, `` When we awaken, we will march against every vestige of oppression, and if you challenge us, then we are going to clash with you until death separates us from life or you from life. But why should that be?'' More than 500 students held a quiet candlelight march prior to <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON>'s visit, while members of a militant Jewish group led students in a loud demonstration outside the hall in which the black leader spoke. `` Farrakhan is a Nazi without a swastika,'' declared <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>, the New York-based head of the <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` He should be in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, not in this campus.'' The visit by <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> and the 38 guards he calls the Fruit of Islam nearly coincided with the first anniversary of a campus building takeover by 100 minority students to protest racial violence at this 30,000-student school in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> was promised $ 11,000 by a black fraternity and a campus speaker program to talk at the university's Fine Arts Center. Tickets sold out within a day. <PERSON> Farrakhan </PERSON> came to national attention in 1984 for calling Judaism `` a gutter religion'' and making other anti-Semitic remarks that his supporters say have been taken out of context in his campaign to foster black pride. The <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> campus has been the scene of racial strife since a fight broke out among black and white students after the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> loss to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> in the final game of the 1986 World Series. On Feb. 11, 1988, minority students began a weeklong occupation of a university building to protest another racial scuffle. The takeover, which was the first of several around the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, ended with the chancellor's agreement to boost programs for minority students.

Sources close to him said he died peacefully at home and had instructed that his death not be announced until after his burial. <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON>, the son of a lumber mill owner, was born in <LOCATION> Winnipeg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, in 1896 and became an engineer. During World War I, he was a pilot in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and shot down 26 German planes. He became a millionaire industrialist by the age of 30, largely as a result of inventing in the 1920s a method of sending pictures by wire. He made a fortune through other business ventures and even found time to win the world amateur light heavyweight boxing championship. But his most famous exploits came after 1940, when he was tapped by <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> to put together the most potent intelligence netork of its kind. He was sent to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> officially to establish an organization to protect British shipping during the war and counter the activities of Nazi spies. But in fact, the operation he set up was later acknowledged to be the hub of all the branches of British intelligence. He also was reported to be the link between <LOCATION> Churchill </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> in the years before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> entered the war. He became <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s top operator in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> and was responsible for training in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> a cadre of spies and saboteurs who operated in Nazi-occuped <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He set up shop in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Rockefeller Center with the approval of President <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, but without of the official knowledge of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which was observing neutrality because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not yet entered the war. <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> and his agents secretly killed at least three German operatives in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and ran clandestine operations to discredit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> politicians who opposed aid to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, according to the popular book on the operation, `` A Man Called Intrepid'' by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>. The book chronicled a dazzling series of successes ranging from code-breaking to dropping agents into occupied <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He was a severe anti-communist after the war. He already had retired by the time his exploits became public, mostly through <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>'s 1976 book and the author's subsequent `` Intrepid's Last Case'' in 1983. <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> stayed out of the public eye until 1987, when <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book <PERSON> Spycatcher </PERSON> became famous because of the British government's attempts to suppress it. He went on record as saying that he believed the late Sir <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, head of the MI5 British spy agency, was a Soviet double agent. `` <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> ... was a bad egg if ever there was one,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stephenson </PERSON> was married in 1924 to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who died in 1978.

<TEXT>
 Jailed political extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> has filed a lawsuit to stop distribution of a newspaper column that he says could incite other inmates to harm him because it calls him a `` cat-killer,'' a lawyer said. The column by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Royko </PERSON>, syndicated through the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, contends that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> followers have killed cats of <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> opponents _ a claim LaRouche followers deny. `` I hope that this column finds its way to his fellow inmates,'' <PERSON> Royko </PERSON> wrote in the column, printed Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and distributed to about 500 newspapers. `` They should know that they have a cat-killer in their midst. And I hope any cat-lovers among them do whatever they feel is appropriate.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Null </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> lawyer who filed the lawsuit in <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday the column is `` nothing less than inciting people to violence.'' Null said that is not something writers can do under constitutional protections of freedom of the press. `` This is a case of a verbal act ... solicitation to commit a crime, to do great bodily harm to Mr. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> or do murder,'' Null said. But <PERSON> Royko </PERSON>, in a telephone interview later Thursday, said violence against <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was not his intent. As to what is `` appropriate'' for other inmates to do with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, <PERSON> Royko </PERSON> said, `` They should lecture him ... they should tell him to caution his people against picking on cats.'' A federal judge in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, sentenced <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> to 15 years in prison Friday for scheming to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and deliberately defaulting on more than $ 30 million in loans from supporters. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, 66, a three-time presidential fringe candidate, was sent to the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail to await transfer to a federal prison. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, originally stressed the importance of keeping the <PERSON> Royko </PERSON> column out of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Null </PERSON> said is distributed in the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> jail. However, the column ran in the newspaper on Wednesday. Null said the lawsuit would still be pressed to avoid any further distribution, and to seek a permanent injunction against any further columns that might incite people to harm <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. A hearing on the lawsuit was set for Friday, <ORGANIZATION> Null </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Rioters threw rocks and bottles and set trash bins on fire Thursday in the second night of violence after a suspected drug dealer died in police custody. Police cordoned off the same predominantly black neighborhood where about 100 officers in riot gear quelled the first outbreak Wednesday night by about 75 young people, many ages 12 to 14. The melee erupted after the arrest of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 40, in an undercover bust. It took eight police officers to subdue Price. Police attempted to ward off further trouble in the <LOCATION> College </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> section Thursday by releasing details of the arrest. Price, who is black, was not beaten or choked but died of cardiac arrest of undetermined cause, Deputy Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DePolis </PERSON> said at a news conference. At sundown, however, more violence erupted, and 70 officers responded. Police reported making nine arrests for inciting to riot, including two juveniles and four members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> There was no official estimate of the number of people involved in the unrest. `` Many of these people that were arrested tonight were outsiders,'' said <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>, who added the situation was under control late Thursday. `` The message is very clear. You come over here and incite riots, you're going to get arrested,'' she said, vowing to stay in the area as long as necessary. An officer hit by a brick, Sgt. <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, was treated and released at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. A couple of trash bins were set ablaze and there was sporadic rock and bottle throwing over a three-hour period, said Sgt. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sluga </PERSON>. On Wednesday night, a grocery store was looted and torched and two shotgun blasts were fired at a news van. One man was arrested, and at least four officers injured in the disturbance. Price, a 6-foot-3, 300-pound man, struggled with two undercover officers after an informant made a drug buy in the housing complex, said police spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. <PERSON> DePolis </PERSON> gave this account of events: When the two plainclothes officers tried to arrest Price, he picked one up off the ground with one hand and punched the other repeatedly in the face. Price suffered a 2-inch gash from a blow to the head, then wrestled free and tried to flee to his girlfriend's apartment as two backup officers arrived The four officers struck Price with their nightsticks on his arm and leg, but he again pulled free. `` Two more officers arrived and all six officers go tumbling into the living room fighting with this man,'' <PERSON> DePolis </PERSON> said. The officers finally managed to slap handcuffs and leg manacles on Price. The girlfriend's mother, who uses a pacemaker and a walker, ended up under the pileup. Paramedics arrived to treat the woman, who was not identified, the officer with the broken nose and to dress Price's head wound. When the rock - and bottle-throwing began, police put Price in a cruiser and drove around the block for safety, which took about 45 seconds `` Medical personnel looked in the car and realized he was suffering cardiac arrest,'' said <PERSON> DePolis </PERSON>. Paramedics treated Price and rushed him to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he was pronounced dead less than 90 minutes after the arrest. The suspect was carrying 25 pieces of crack cocaine and a loaded 25-caliber derringer in his pockets, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. Price, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, was sentenced in 1974 to 50 years on a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> robbery conviction and also had a 1967 robbery arrest on his record, said <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, adding he did not know the disposition of that case. Officials cordoned off four intersections in the 22-block housing development and summoned 100 police officers and 30 firefighters to quell the disturbance. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bexley </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Bexley </PERSON>'s Bar-B-Q in the neighborhood, said some of the young people looted a grocery store before it was set on fire. `` Once they broke it, it took 10 to 15 minutes and they cleared it out,'' he said. `` Some went in, then things come flying out windows and doors.'' The fire forced choir members at the <ORGANIZATION> Deliverance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tabernacle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to move an organ and other valuables into a truck as a precaution. A young man with a 10-gauge shotgun fired on a <ORGANIZATION> WFLA-TV </ORGANIZATION> van, said cameraman <PERSON> Rugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who was not injured. The College Hill neighborhood and housing development have been the site of frequent confrontations between residents and police in recent years, including an incident last April when a crowd 400 threw rocks and bottles after the arrest of a robbery suspect, and a violent outbreak in February 1987 after a 23-year-old black man died in police custody. A white police officer who used a neck hold to subdue him eventually was cleared of wrongdoing and the neck hold was banned. `` People feel trapped and they're ready to explode when something even looks like brutality,'' said <PERSON> Eliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, pastor of Blessed Hope Ministries two blocks from the looted grocery store. `` ... We're still sitting on a keg of dynamite down here.' Last month, blacks in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> rioted for several days after a police officer fatally shot a speeding black motorcyclist.

 A domestic airliner taking off from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> airport crashed Friday after striking a tree, killing 26 people and injuring the three other people aboard, the state radio said. Four more people were injured on the ground when the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> 27 crashed near housing for families of air force personnel at <LOCATION> Mingaladon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said. The radio gave engine failure as the cause of the crash, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s fourth since mid-1987 It said the turboprop failed to gain altitude and hit the tree shortly after takeoff on a flight to <LOCATION> Kengtung </LOCATION>, 380 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The aircraft carried 25 passengers, a pilot, co-pilot and two stewards. The report did not identify the three survivors and described victims on the ground as family members of air force personnel. All on board were presumed to be Burmese nationals, since <LOCATION> Kengtung </LOCATION> is normally off limits to foreigners due to security problems in the area. <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has lost four <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 27s, a Dutch-manufactured aircraft, since June 21, 1987, when 45 people were killed after a takeoff from Heho airport in the <LOCATION> Shan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. All 49 persons on board were killed near <LOCATION> Pagan </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in a crash on Oct. 11, 1987. On June 16, a chartered aircraft crashed on a flight from <LOCATION> Myitkyina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Putao </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and all four persons aboard were killed. Several others crashes occurred in earlier years. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s tiny fleet of eight aircraft is plagued by a shortage of spare parts and poor maintenance.

<HEAD>Producers Reduce Flocks to Raise Egg Profits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's egg producers are shipping lazy hens off to the soup factory in an effort to reduce flock sizes, but even those stern measures are unlikely to return quick profits to the battered industry. Department economists say that losses to egg producers in 1988 were the highest since <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> began keeping those financial records 17 years ago. As of Jan. 1, the hen flock that produces table eggs _ the kind in cartons _ was estimated by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> at 233.4 million birds, 6 percent fewer than a year earlier. Overall hen flocks, including hens producing eggs to hatch new chicks, declined 5 percent to 271.3 million birds. `` This was the largest liquidation of layers since the avian influenza outbreak in 1983,'' says economist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>. Egg consumption is expected to continue its decline to around 235 eggs per person this year from an average of about 243 in 1988 and 259 in 1984. according to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` Health concerns relating to cholesterol content may be affecting egg consumption,'' the agency said in a recent report. `` At the same time, egg producers have spent little money on changing the image of eggs or convincing consumers that eggs are not just for breakfast.'' Meanwhile, egg prices at the farm were erratic at times in 1988 but wound up the year averaging 62.1 cents per dozen, about the same as in 1987. But production costs have risen in recent years, and in 1988 producers nationally lost an average of 5.2 cents per dozen. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Witucki </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economist, said Thursday in a telephone interview that the 1988 loss of 5.2 cents per dozen eggs was the second poor year in a row for egg producers, who barely broke even nationally with an average net return of 0.2 cents in 1987. According to agency records, he said, producers averaged a net profit of 6.9 cents in 1986 before rising feed costs and other expenses cut margins. Last year was the first real loss since 1980, when producers had a negative average of 3.5 cents per dozen, he said. Further, <PERSON> Witucki </PERSON> said, last year's 5.2 cents was the largest annual loss since the agency began keeping track in 1972, a year when egg producers lost an average of 2.8 cents per dozen. As with any national figures, he said, some egg producers have made money and others have lost. The yearly averages are general indicators of how the industry is faring. `` We expect more negatives in the first half -LRB- of 1989 -RRB-, with feed prices playing a role,'' <PERSON> Witucki </PERSON> said. `` Hopefully, with normal crops, feed prices should decline in the second half. But I'm afraid it does n't look real bright.'' All states have some commercial egg production, even <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> with an output of about 700,000 eggs last year. The top 10 and their 1988 output in millions of eggs: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 7,718. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 5,644. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 5,302. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 4,477. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, 4,294. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, 3,784. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, 3,396. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 3,363. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 2,758. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, 2,596.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a growing consumer of nuts, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report says <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exporters are finding the market a bit hard to crack. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that Japanese imports of tree nuts increased more than 40 percent in five years to almost 64,000 metric tons worth $ 220 million in 1987. Although <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> almonds and walnuts are on the upswing in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, some other foreign suppliers are much bigger for certain kinds of nuts. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has no quotas on the import of tree nuts, the report said. But import duties have ranged from 4 percent for almonds to 9 percent for pistachios and macadamia nuts, 10 percent for hazelnuts and 16 percent for chestnuts and walnuts. However, under the U.S-Japan beef and citrus agreement signed last July, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed to eliminate the duty on pistachios, lower it for macadamias and pecans to 5 percent, and reduce the walnut duty to 10 percent, the report said. `` Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the market for pistachios, hazelnuts and macadamia nuts are relatively small, sales have increased notably in the past few years and the future appears bright,'' the report said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is the main supplier of pistachios to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is the largest provider of hazelnuts, and <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> has more than half of the market for macadamia nuts.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has proposed to sharply increase inspection user fees on imported flue-cured and burley tobacco. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that all flue-cured and burley that is affirmed by importers to be free of prohibited pesticides is currently assessed fees of 0.1 cents per pound for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> verification. The proposal would raise the fee to 0.35 cents per pound and establish a minimum fee of $ 162 per shipment for sampling and testing. <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said that tobacco not affirmed by importers to be free of banned chemicals is currently charged an additional fee of 0.3 cents per pound to cover <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s more extensive testing. The proposal would raise this fee to 0.35 cents. The 1985 farm law required <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> to revise its fees to reflect changing costs in the inspection and testing of imported tobacco, he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he is much better, thank you, and so all <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> can breathe a sigh of relief and put <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> out of mind. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caught a stubborn cold a few days after taking office two weeks ago, and it was the sort thing that calls attention to itself in a new president. His voice turned raspy, and he apologized to an audience of sailors in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Tuesday for `` just croaking away.'' On Wednesday he lost his voice altogether to laryngitis, and greeted guests at a diplomatic reception that night in a bare whisper. He canceled a speech, looked flushed, said he was taking antibiotics for an ear infection, and kept saying it was only a cold. But, `` I'm a totally new man,'' he reported Thursday. `` All well. Totally recovered.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> likes to compare himself to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>, but it was <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>'s successor in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who came uneasily to mind. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, 68, gaunt, malnourished and apparently suffering from ulcers, delivered the longest inaugural address on record _ one hour and 45 minutes _ in cold, blustery, wet weather on March 4, 1841. A month later, he was dead in the White House. He refused to wear a hat or coat when riding a horse to his inauguration and then, despite the weather, declined to shorten his 8,578-word speech. He led a parade back to the White House and that night attended three inaugural balls. He caught a cold. Harassed and fatigued from the demands of office seekers, he was unable to shake it off. No help was offered by the environment of a poorly heated White House. According to `` Medical Cover-Ups in the White House,'' by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacMahon </PERSON>, a doctor, and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, a journalist, published in 1987, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> _ like many presidents _ was given inadequate care. `` American presidential history is filled with examples of medical treatment that has ranged from questionable to downright incompetent,'' the authors say. By March 27, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who had avoided standard medical treatment all his life, was willing to submit to the doctors. He and they both `` knew that the diagnosis _ pneumonia of the right lower lobe of the lung with congestion of the liver _ constituted, in those days, a fatal complication,'' the book says. The doctors first blistered the skin on the right side of his chest, then applied suction cups to draw out what they considered to be the offensive substance making the president ill. That weakened him Next they induced vomiting, gave him castor oil to purge his bowels and finally gave him sedatives in the form of opium and brandy. As a last resort, they tried a Seneca Indian remedy, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> snakeweed. It did n't work, either. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s treatment was presumably more medically relevant than <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s and presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was able to pronounce his boss fit Thursday afternoon. `` His prognosis is excellent,'' he said. `` He's in good shape. His voice is getting stronger. He feels well.'' So <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> relaxed. People here laughed again at what comedian <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said during an inauguration event _ that the five most feared words in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were, `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, I do n't feel well.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigative committee may summon the head of the nation's largest Indian tribe to address allegations he accepted cash payments and favors from contractors seeking work on its reservation. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said after Thursday's committee session that he is `` pursuing'' the question of whether to invite <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> to testify before the panel, and whether to subpoena him if necessary A special investigative committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs has been holding hearings all week in which allegations have been made of corruption and mismanagement in federal Indian programs and on reservations. The investigation was inspired by a series of reports in The <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and other publications. Two white construction company owners and a <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> contractor, testifying under immunity, spoke Thursday of free airplane rides, cash payments and other favors they gave <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> in hopes of increasing their business on the 25,000-square-mile Navajo Nation reservation in northeastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and adjoining parts of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. They and another Indian construction official also said it was common for non-Indians to create dummy companies headed by Indians in order to qualify for federally financed projects set aside for members of the minority group. Tribal spokeswoman <PERSON> Tazbah </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullah </PERSON>, speaking from tribal offices in <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said the accounts of fraud and abuse made during the week were `` malicious allegations'' designed to `` discredit the integrity of the Navajo nation, its people, government and sovereignty.'' She said a delegation of 11 tribal officials would travel to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, perhaps by Monday, to testify to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. She said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> would not be among them. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said the committee would hear next week about organized crime and sexual abuses connected with Indian programs. Thursday's session focused on favors allegedly provided to <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, 60. Contractor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paddock </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Marana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, testified he had offered <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> the use of a company airplane and pilot during the chairman's 1986 re-election campaign. He said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> ended up taking about 35 flights, many of them after his November 1986 election and including two trips to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Paddock </PERSON> said he had not been reimbursed for the trips He said the flights cost him $ 12,000 in pilot and fuel costs, and would have been worth more than $ 60,000 commercially. <PERSON> Paddock </PERSON> said his company was declared ineligible to work on the Navajo reservation by <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Zah </PERSON>, who had ousted <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> from the chairmanship in 1982. The company was recertified for contracts after <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> recaptured the position. <PERSON> Paddock </PERSON> said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> asked him for a $ 35,000 one-year loan in December 1987, money Paddock gave <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and has not been repaid. The contractor said he paid many of the expenses of the two <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> trips he and <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> took with their wives and other couples; lent a company truck to <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s daughter, Hope; and paid a $ 400 bill he received for her use of the vehicle's telephone. He said he also contributed $ 2,500 to a birthday party for the chairman's wife, <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON>, and was later reimbursed for only about half of the amount. <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON>, a contractor from <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, and his Navajo partner, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Chee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, told of giving <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> $ 1,000 during his re-election campaign in 1986. They also described separate payments of $ 1,000, $ 5,000 and $ 3,000 they said were made last year, and an effort to purchase <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> a $ 5,500 replica of a Model A <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> that was thwarted after an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent began making inquiries. `` In my culture, when an elder asks you for help, I did n't see any problem with $ 3,000 or $ 4,000 at the outset,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` It was just a small favor, but I did n't realize it would get this large.''

<HEAD>Firm Barred From Recruiting at Law School After Partner Makes Racist

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> law school has barred a prestigious law firm from on-campus recruiting for one year because a partner made racist, sexist and anti-Semitic remarks during an interview with a student. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, dean of the law school, commended the Chicago-based law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> on Thursday for displaying `` sensitivity, professionalism and ... integrity'' after the incident became public. But, he added in a statement, `` just as <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> has assured us it will take strong steps to condemn this behavior and to prevent its repetition, so too must we take strong steps to protect our students against insulting and degrading conduct in the interview process.'' The ban, which covers the 1989-90 academic year and had been recommended by the university's <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Placement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, came nearly a week after initial reports of the job interview. `` This is especially painful because we've always taken great pride in being part of the solution rather than part of the problem,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, chairman of the executive committee at <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON>, one of the world's largest law firms. `` But obviously, when something like this happens, you must take a look at yourself again.'' According to last Friday's edition of the law school student newspaper, the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, a partner from <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> later identified as <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON> conducted the interview with a black female law student. Neither the law school nor the firm has disputed the account. The student has not been identified. Among other things, <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON> asked the student during a discussion about the practice of law how she would react to being called a `` black bitch'' or `` nigger'' by adversaries or colleagues. When the student remarked at another juncture that she played golf, the partner responded: `` Why do n't blacks have their own country clubs?'' He then answered his own question, saying, `` There are n't too many golf courses in the ghetto.'' The newspaper also paraphrased <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON> as remarking he would n't want to belong to a Jewish country club, `` but at least they had their own. <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON> declined to comment when reached by telephone Thursday night at his suburban <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> home, and referred all questions to <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON>, a partner for 20 years, has taken an `` indefinite leave.'' He said that <PERSON> O'Kane </PERSON> is `` not a racist,'' and suggested his commments may have been a kind of `` stress test'' for the applicant. `` But let me reiterate there is no attempt to excuse what he did. We'll deal with what -LRB- disciplinary action -RRB- is appropriate in the days ahead,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McKenzie </PERSON> operates 44 offices in 26 countries and has approximately 1,300 lawyers worldwide. Of the estimated 400 lawyers working in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said there would be 10 blacks after the current round of hiring. Of the firms' 432 partners, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said about 30 were women and none are black; 23, however, are graduates of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> law school.

<HEAD>NYC Ballet Presents Two New Peter Martins Ballets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attractive, major new ballet and a brief, rather insignificant ballet duet, both choreographed by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Martins </PERSON>, were danced for the first time by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> on Thursday night. `` Mozart Serenade,'' for four couples, four women soloists and a corps de ballet, filled the stage in a balanced, flowing, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> way, without looking like an imitation of a Balanchine ballet. Balance is appropriate because the music is selections from <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Serenades in D Major.'' However, the symmetry is more relaxed than rigid, giving the dance a contemporary look. When one of the four lead couples has a duet, the other six dancers stand as onlookers in two rows of three rather than staying always as couples. The corps de ballet flowed smoothly, melting from three rows of dancers, which gave soloists aisles to dance in, to form a picture frame outlining the soloists. The dancing was of a high order and stressed ensemble _ with soloists and corps presenting one picture. The main costume color, by <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Maters </PERSON>, was pearl gray, accented attractively by darker grays. Gray draperies were hung at each side of the stage. The four lead couples, mostly relatively new to the company, were <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roma </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosenko </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Byars </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zippora </PERSON> <PERSON> Karz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Huys </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerveris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martins </PERSON> also was in a formal mood for the brief pas de deux titled `` Beethoven Romance.'' <PERSON> Kyra </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> wore green over purple chiffon and <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Luders </PERSON>' costume suggested a Viennese cavalry officer's uniform and boots. The dance was romantic. The couple, both dancing beautifully, moved away from each other and met again in embraces. Miss <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> had a brief solo but there were no solo variations for <PERSON> Luders </PERSON>. He had to be content with dancing away from the ballerina and jumping, thrusting one leg high and behind him as he reached a far corner, a step he does very well. A viewer was left with the feeling that there might have been more. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsop </PERSON> was the noteworthy soloist in <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>'s `` Romance in F Major for Violin and Orchestra.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> conducted. The evening began with a terrific presentation of `` Interplay,'' <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>' 1945 witty working of <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>'s music. <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> shone, leading the section titled `` Horseplay.'' The finale was <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s exhilarating `` Stars and Stripes.'' The company is dancing through Feb. 26 at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Theater.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Ponders Arab Arms But Has No Peace Plan
Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>An AP News Analysis</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has begun to weigh a new package of potential <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to the Arab world even as prospects for <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks remain cloudy. The possible purchases under discussion with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials are bound to touch off a row with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, for instance, might get 315 Abrams tanks, probably the best in the world, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emirates </ORGANIZATION> 40 jet fighters. The list is far from final. It's only a wish list _ what the oil-rich Arab countries and other potential customers would like to buy. Reaction to the soundings that began last Friday on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> could force changes before the White House makes formal requests for approval. In the meantime, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has unveiled a proposal to extend autonomy _ but not statehood _ to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The plan was rejected outright by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which is gaining diplomatic support in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and apparently sees no reason to compromise on its demand for a state carved out of Israeli-held territory. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also has not engendered any enthusiasm from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration despite his offer to withdraw troops from some of the population centers on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> once Palestinians there accept autonomy. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> simply has had nothing to say about the offer. In the Camp <PERSON> David </PERSON> agreements 10 years ago, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> called for autonomy for the Palestinians. After five years of managing their own local affairs, negotiations would be opened for a permanent arrangement. All options, including statehood, would be on the table. The idea was to see how living together would work, but <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was ostracized for approving something less than immediate statehood for the Palestinians and the plan never got off the ground. If the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has another approach in mind it has not tipped its hand, although Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> ruled out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for an independent Palestinian state at his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing. The classified arms list under discussion in <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> corridors and over lunches reflects a traditional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> approach of trying to lubricate <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> diplomacy with weapons. A copy obtained Thursday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> showed <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> under consideration for 200 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles, four helicopters and some new radar and equipment for its jet fighters. The potential Arab purchases have far more punch. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a wealthy <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> state, could receive 200 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tanks, known also as the M1A1 and considered by experts to be the best in the world. Other key items include 40 Maverick air-to-ground missiles with an infrared guidance system and electronic warfare gear for <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> and 24 F-16 jet fighters and 100 <ORGANIZATION> Mavericks </ORGANIZATION> and 100 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles for <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> follows through with specific requests he will have a battle on his hand. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters are concerned that <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> weapons could be turned against the Jewish state in a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the power to block a purchase, but only if a majority of both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reject a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, declined to identify any of the weapons under consideration. He stressed it was not a `` sale plan,'' but rather the administration's `` best estimate'' of other countries' weapons needs. `` Each item has to be reviewed by this administration,'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s supporters were successful during the Carter and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in blocking some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales to both <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. But the skillful management of <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION>, then the White House chief of staff, and other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration operatives overcame stubborn resistance in 1981 to the sale of Awacs radar planes to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> which the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved 52-48. The White House, in a cover letter, informed <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> were in the process of deciding whether to request <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or European fighter planes to replace their F-5s in the next decade, the sources said. The letter said the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> were considering jet fighters to be jointly produced by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the French Mirage 4000, as well as U.S.-built F-16s and F-18s. Besides the Abrams tanks, on the list for the <LOCATION> Saudis </LOCATION> were seven multiple-launch artillery rocket systems, for battlefield use, and seven of the box-type rockets for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> along with 1,500 Tow anti-tank missiles.

<HEAD>Kemp Move Blunts Ethics Question, Senate Confirms Appointment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> blunted last-minute ethical questions about his acceptance of speaking fees exceeding <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits to win unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation as secretary of housing and urban development. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously to confirm <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, the former professional football player who served 18 years as a congressman from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and unsuccessfully ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988. The vote followed by hours the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s vote to recommend <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s nomination to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the housing and urban affairs subcommittee, said Democrats on the committee and the committee's staff concluded that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s acceptance of thousands of dollars in speaking fees above <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits was `` part of a misunderstanding'' and no bar to his confirmation `` There was no reason to do anything to embarrass him or to harass him to block him,'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s financial disclosure reports show that in 1988 he accepted or agreed to accept $ 67,350 above what <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules allow a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to accept in one year. The limit is 30 percent of salary, or $ 26,850. In addition, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> accepted honoraria far larger than the $ 2,000 per event limit. When committee staff raised questions with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> last week, he agreed to return, forgo or defer more than $ 67,000 in speaking fees to bring his 1988 fees within House limits. Congressional and federal ethics officials said Thursday, however, that it was unclear whether part of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s remedy _ the deferral of $ 12,500 in excess fees from 1988 to 1989 _ was permitted by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and federal law. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> declined to comment Thursday on the matter, said his spokeswoman, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunette </PERSON>. On Wednesday he attributed the problems to a misunderstanding on his part of the limits. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said, `` There was ambiguity in the rules that led to uncertainty as to what one could or could not do.'' At the federal Office of Government Ethics, deputy director <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said staff attorneys concluded they could not resolve the questions over <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s fees and the House rules. `` We could n't get anybody there -LRB- at the congressional ethics committees -RRB- that would give us any answers,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. As a result, the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee that it was approving <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s finances within executive branch standards only. House rules forbid members from deferring income from one year to the next `` to avoid the income limitation,'' according to the ethics manual for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff director <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottlieb </PERSON> said he did not object to the deferral, however, because he did not believe honoraria were included in that prohibition. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davison </PERSON>, staff attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION>, the ethics committee, declined to say whether the committee or its staff had examined the <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> case, saying such information was private. He said the deferral question would be up to the committee, but he added, `` I would suggest caution in making an intentional deferral.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> ruled on that question in a 1984 case. It said: `` A member may not accept the offer of an organization to defer payment of an honorarium to a subsequent calender year in order to avoid the limitation on honoraria applicable for the year in which the honorarium is earned.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s move also raised the question of what his 1989 limit would be, since he served only two days as a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before resigning Jan. 2. The House rules say the limit is 30 percent of aggregate salary paid during that calender year _ which could mean 30 percent of two day's pay, or about $ 150. Under that interpretation he would have to forgo the $ 12,500 or give most of it to charity. The rules allow members who receive more fees than are permitted in a year to reach the limit by donating the excess to charity. Asked whether <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> would exceed his 1989 limit by deferring the $ 12,500, <PERSON> Davison </PERSON> said, `` I will not interpret that for you ... but it says, aggregate salary, as a member, paid in a calendar year.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> sought to comply with the rules this week by agreeing to return $ 16,000 in speaking fees and to forgo another $ 39,400 in fees earned but not yet received. He deferred receipt of $ 12,500 in fees earned in 1988 until 1989, a move that left him $ 550 under the 1988 limit. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s spokeswoman Brunette, asked if <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> believed the deferral of the $ 12,500 might still be improper, she said she would relay that question but did not respond further.

<HEAD>Pay Raise Spotlight Now on House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s rejection of a 51 percent congressional pay raise places the spotlight on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership plan to legalize the increase next week but scale it back to 30 percent a day later. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 95-5 vote Thursday against the raise sent the two houses in different directions, and `` no one knows'' how the controversy will be resolved, said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., `` I do n't believe we'll know that for a matter of weeks or months. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution included language to roll back the raise if it becomes law and end the system allowing congressional increases, along with those for top federal executives and judges, to become law automatically unless rejected by both houses. The chief sponsors were Republican Sens. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Also approved, by unanimous voice vote, was a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rules change that would ban senators from keeping fees for speeches, articles and appearances. But the ban on such fees, typically paid by special-interest groups, would only remain in effect while senators were receiving the raise. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> action has strong political appeal to a public angry with the size of the raise, but will have little practical effect under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s plan to let the increase become law automatically next Wednesday. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> plans to use a risky parliamentary procedure that requires a two-thirds majority to scale back the raise to 30 percent, and to pass a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ban on speaking fees along with other outside income restrictions. House Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said there was only a 50-50 chance of getting the two-thirds while Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, and a leading pay raise opponent, predicted it would be `` very difficult for the speaker to find two-thirds to vote for the resolution. Rank-and-file lawmakers would see their salaries rise from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 under the full raise. But the pay would be $ 116,350 under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s plan, the same amount <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members can now receive in salary plus honoraria _ defined as fees for speeches, appearances and articles. Even if the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> plan passed, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would be unlikely to go along, since senators can now keep $ 35,800 in honoraria and would therefore lose money by accepting a smaller $ 26,850 raise. While the two houses haggled, the 51 percent raise would remain in effect along with the honoraria bans. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> explained his rollback plan at a news conference Thursday, emphasizing the virtue of banning honoraria and taking that same amount in salary. `` The difference is we will be serving one master, not two, that is, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' he said. `` I do n't like to articulate failure,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, when asked what will happen if his plan is defeated. `` If for some reason it does n't work, we will regroup.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could try to pass the 30 percent raise by a majority, like most legislation, but opponents might be able to tack on language rescinding the raise altogether. Under the two-thirds rule, no amendments would be in order. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plan would scale back the raise for all three branches of government, even though the Constitution prohibits judges' pay from being reduced. `` I think the courts are likely to hold it's unconstitutional to do this to the judiciary,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> released results of a survey showing 57 percent of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members opposing a pay raise vote before the Tuesday midnight deadline and 54 percent favoring instead a vote to reduce the raise to 30 percent. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said his proposed $ 26,850 pay raise was `` a decent raise but not an exorbitant raise,'' compared with the $ 45,500 increase proposed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and endorsed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Actually, most <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members would find their incomes substantially increased, since fewer than half reach the current honoraria limit of 30 percent of income, according to their financial disclosures. The five senators who voted against the package to eliminate the currently-proposed pay increase were <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. Their votes do not necessarily mean they support the 51 percent raise. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> honoraria package would: _ Prohibit acceptance of honoraria, but allow a donation to charity on the members' behalf Donations would be limited to $ 2,000 per appearance. _ Prohibit members from receiving any pension or tax benefit resulting from the charitable payments _ Prohibit conversion of the charitable donations to personal use by a member or former member _ Require the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee to issue guidelines for travel expenses reimbursed by outside individuals or organizations

<HEAD>ABA, Senators May Meet on Secret Nominations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s president says there are limits to how much secrecy the lawyers' group will give up in evaluating nominees for the federal bench, but he's willing to meet with senators about possible changes in procedure. The issue of how the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> rates judicial candidates came up again Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It first arose during consideration of unsuccessful <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominees <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, and came to a head during hearings on <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, whose nomination was approved. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is also considering two challenges to the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s confidential role in screening applicants `` It seems especially appropriate that we undertake this reevaluation before the committee faces another <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nomination rather than in the context of that operation which we started to do during the Kennedy nomination,'' Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, said Thursday. `` I believe that we must do it if we are to avoid a repeat of the very unsatisfying situation and the hard feelings arising out of the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> series of hearings,'' he said. `` At best, there is uniform discomfort with the way the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> proceeds,'' said committee chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, reflecting the bipartisan nature of the criticism. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., said that he and ranking Republican Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, will arrange to meet with top leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> and its standing committee on the federal judiciary to try to resolve the problems During the December 1987 hearings on <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, some Republicans called for the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> panel to hold its deliberations on judicial candidates in public since the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gives great weight to its advice. However, panel chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> refused, saying: `` You are free to accept or reject our views. You are free to ignore us.'' During the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> hearings, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, accused four members of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> panel of being `` willing to play politics'' on the nomination. While 10 of the 15 panel members gave <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> the highest rating of `` well qualified,'' four reportedly said he was unqualified and a fifth was said to have taken the neutral ground of `` not opposed.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, reached in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> where the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> is holding its mid-year meeting, said his organization would be happy to meet with the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've been working for them since 1948, and they're our bosses, so to speak,'' <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said. `` We're always looking for ways to improve the system.'' But he said there would be limits on how much secrecy the standing committee would give up, saying some of that material would have to remain confidential due to possible repercussions against people who speak to the panel when asked about a judicial nominee. `` That person practices in the area -LRB- of the nominee -RRB-,'' noted <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, with the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Foerster. `` If that person said something critical, and the nominee became a judge, it could cause problems for him.'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> was not in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office on Thursday and his secretary said he would be unavailable until next week. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is considering a consolidated case of two challenges to the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>'s confidential role in screening federal judicial candidates. A lower court judge ruled that imposing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Act _ which requires public scrutiny of advisory groups _ on judicial selection would violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> got involved in the evaluation process to keep the appointment of judges `` from being a political cesspool,'' and `` to make it hard for a president or a senator to put a crony on the bench.'' He asked committee members to give him comments and criticisms of the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> for discussion during his and <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>'s meeting with <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> representatives. Following that meeting, there may be an informal session with the entire <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and, if necessary, the committee would call a formal public hearing, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Measles Outbreak Blamed On `Toddler Immunization Gap'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One-sixth of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s 1988 measles patients came from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where an ongoing outbreak among mostly Hispanic toddlers demonstrates a nationwide need to vaccinate 1 - to 4-year-olds, experts say `` We seem to have a toddler immunization gap,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, chief of acute communicable disease control for the county <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of those kids do n't get vaccinated until they go to school,'' where measles shots are mandatory. The extent of the outbreak of the virus-caused respiratory disease in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> was reported by the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in today's issue of the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The county last year reported 513 measles cases, 17.5 percent _ or more than one-sixth _ of the nation's total of 2,933, the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Two of the patients, ages 8 months and 23 months, died. <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>, a co-author of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report, said he did n't know how many measles cases occurred in the county so far this year, but said the outbreak is continuing at a slower pace. Eight unvaccinated children of <LOCATION> Samoan </LOCATION> descent were brought this week to two <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> hospitals, where two of them died, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Yukelson </PERSON>, spokesman for Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> said he understood they belonged to a religious group opposed to vaccinations. Of the 1988 cases, an ethnic group was identified for 331 of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> measles patients, and 77.6 percent of them were Hispanic. Age was known for 353, and of those, 25 percent were younger than 1, while 40 percent were ages 1 to 4, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> report said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> considers 15 months to be the minimum age for vaccination, and 26 percent fell in the 16-month-old to 4-year-old age group. But the outbreak prompted <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON>'s department last July to lower the minimum age for vaccination in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to 1 year. Infants exposed to the measles in areas where the virus is endemic, such as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, should be vaccinated at 6 months, even though the vaccine's effectiveness is questionable for children younger than 1 year, <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> said. Officials in some counties recommend dual vaccinations at 9 months and 15 months, he added. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said lowering the minimum vaccination age is an important way to help control measles in infants. `` The routine age for vaccination is 15 months, but in most states where vaccinations are required for school, you've got that 4 -LCB- - year period where they are not ... required to have measles immunization,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehr-Green </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measles specialist <PERSON> Waterman </PERSON> said this immunization gap is worst among `` the lower socioeconomic status population and Hispanics. They just have variable access to health care. Some of them may be afraid to go to institutions because they're undocumented -LRB- aliens -RRB-. They may not be aware they can get the vaccinations for free with no questions asked.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommended programs aimed at reaching parents and children in poor areas and use of churches, schools and mobile vans as temporary vaccination sites. In the late 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measles specialists believed the childhood disease could be eradicated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by fall 1982. That goal was n't met. In the past six years, between 1,497 and 6,282 cases have been reported nationally each year. Part of the problem is what researchers call `` non-preventable'' cases _ patients too young for vaccinations to be effective and those who were vaccinated but still got measles, since at best one in 20 vaccinations does not provide full immunity. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 58 percent of cases overall were considered non-preventable, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said restarting the crippled <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear reactors probably will take longer than previously forecast, raising new concerns about supplies of a gas used in making atomic weapons. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON>, the department's top safety official, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday it was `` not likely'' that even one of the three reactors would be restarted this year as planned. All three have been shut down since last spring because of structural, safety and managerial problems. The subcommittee was reconvening today for a closed session on how long the reactors could remain shut down without harming national security. Among the scheduled witnesses were Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Herres </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Nuclear Weapons Council. `` I expect we're going to get some unpleasant news,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., told Thursday's session <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> is the nation's only source of tritium, a perishable gas used in the production of most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons. For weeks the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has said it expected to restart one reactor by the end of the year, but <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> indicated he could not be sure it would be operating even by January 1991. `` A lot of things would have to happen very quickly, and they are not happening,'' <PERSON> Starostecki </PERSON> said of preparations to meet the year-end 1989 target. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s acting assistant secretary for defense programs, told the subcommittee at least one of the reactors would have to be restarted by the end of the year to avoid a squeeze on supplies of tritium. The exact level of current tritium supplies is classified. `` It is our goal to resume operations this calendar year,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said, adding, `` I'm an optimist.'' He later said a restart could be accomplished by October at best and that if new problems were encountered, the target date could slip. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said in a written statement to the subcommittee that the effort to resume production of tritium `` is becoming critical'' because of the weapons requirements. `` If a reactor is not restarted this year, then the supply of tritium could be reduced to such an extent that the nuclear stockpile may be affected,'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said. Asked how much confidence he held in the official goal of getting <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in shape to produce adequate supplies of tritium until a proposed new generation of reactors comes on line late in the 1990s, <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said, `` I wish my confidence were higher.'' <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> said that by March the department should be able to set a target date for restarting the K reactor. By then, a department safety advisory panel is expected to have completed its assessment of the criteria for restarting the reactor. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, told the subcommittee that his company's own assessment of the safety, technical and management problems at the plant will be done by March. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> is due to take over April 1 from E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as operator of the plant, which is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and has been a key link in the nationwide network of nuclear weapons plants since the late 1940s. Some officials voiced doubts about <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>'s claim that it will improve safety and efficiency at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> by bringing in its own core management team while retaining more than 90 percent of the 11,000-strong Du Pont workforce there. `` It's going to be very difficult to make the level of changes necessary'' even if <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> expands its core <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> management group to as many as 150 people, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearne </PERSON>, chairman of an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> advisory panel on safety.

 Federal ethics officials say <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-designate <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> appears to have no conflict of interest problems, but an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation into his tenure as a medical school president continues. An <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> lawyer said Thursday that his client, a suspended <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, commissioner convicted of extortion, told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> never tried to improperly influence him. In a half-hour meeting with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents earlier this week, <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> was asked about his relationship with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> paid Eaves more than $ 34,000 as a lecturer over four years while <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> used his seat on the county commission to promote measures that benefited the school Published reports said Eaves had lectured twice during the time he was paid by the school. According to <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> told agents `` that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> never sought to influence any of the decisions he had to make as a commissioner, either as a result of his friendship or any other position he might have had with <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>.'' The lawyer also said <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> he had not negotiated his position with <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> through <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> directly and was unsure <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> knew that he was being paid by the school as a lecturer. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and Eaves were undergraduates together at <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and their relationship has been `` primarily of a social nature,'' <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> said. The interview took place at a federal prison at <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where Eaves is serving a six-year sentence for extortion, the lawyer said. He is appealing his conviction. On another front, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> got a boost from the Office of Government Ethics, which is working on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s request for permission to maintain a relationship with the medical school he founded while at the same time he heads HHS. The possibilities include a paid sabbatical. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy director of the office, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the office foresees no problems with that issue, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s finances or any potential conflicts of interest between the new job and federal aid to <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, which in fiscal 1988 amounted to $ 5.8 million from HHS. `` It's simply a matter now of getting the forms written down, because all the problems have been worked out,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. The White House has cited the continuing <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> background check and the incomplete financial disclosure forms as reasons for asking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to postpone <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing. It had been scheduled for Wednesday this week, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> agreed to put if off indefinitely. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had no comment. At <LOCATION> Morehouse </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has been asking school officials about <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s connection to Eaves, who was found guilty last May of accepting $ 35,000 from an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in exchange for his vote on a zoning matter. He was suspended from the commission when he was indicted in October 1987. `` They talked to me about a range of issues about Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s fitness for the position -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary -RRB-, including that -LRB- Eaves -RRB- and many other things,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, executive vice president of the medical school He declined to identify the other issues. One proposal Eaves pushed as a commissioner was to increase <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>'s participation at <ORGANIZATION> Grady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. He wanted the county hospital authority to allow <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> to provide more patient care at <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>. J.W. <PERSON> Pinkston </PERSON>, executive director of <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, said that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had contacted him and that other hospital administrators in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> region have told him they also had been questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in a background check on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Caterpillar's Diet Determines its Appearance, Researcher Finds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 To a small caterpillar living in oak trees in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, the old saying `` you are what you eat'' is not just wise advice _ it's the code of survival. <PERSON> Erick </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a researcher from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, reports today in the journal Science that the food eaten by the caterpillar nemoria arizonaria causes bodily changes allowing the insect to mimic the seasonal appearance of its oak tree home. In effect, the caterpillars hatched in spring eat their way into bright yellow and green outfits resembling a flower, while fall caterpillars munch on leaves to assume the subdued gray-green appearance of a plain twig. The survival strategy, said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, probably developed as camouflage concealment from hungry birds. `` Both fall and spring caterpillars have identical genetic material,'' said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. `` The spring brood and the fall brood look exactly the same when they hatch. Their later change depends entirely on what the caterpillar eats. Diet cues turn on or off the right set of genes so that they turn into the right shape at the right time of year.'' Caterpillars, or larvae, hatched in the spring come out and immediately begin feeding on the oak catkin, or flower. Soon, these caterpillars turn bright yellow with green dots and develop the fuzzy, segmented shape that mimics the oak blossom. After a few weeks, the caterpillar turns into a pupa and later into an adult moth. The adult quickly mates, lays eggs and dies, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. The new eggs soon hatch and caterpillars identical to the spring brood appear. But once this group start feeding, there are quick changes. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said that by the time the fall brood appears, the oak tree has lost its blossoms and has leaves. The new caterpillars nibble on these leaves and soon develop a smooth, gray-green body that resembles the oak twig. Powerful jaws, capable of chewing the leathery oak leaves, also appear. Oak leaves have a high content of a chemical compound called tannin. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said this compound apparently triggers the genetic response to create the fall caterpillar's twiglike shape and color. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> made his discovery by collecting eggs of the insect, hatching them in the laboratory under controlled conditions and then feeding the caterpillars either oak flowers or oak leaves. It proved, he said, that diet made the difference. `` You could give me a spring or a fall caterpillar and I could turn it into either form, depending on what I feed it,'' he said. `` If I fed the fall caterpillars spring pollen, they would all turn into the catkin -LRB- flower -RRB- form. It depends entirely on what the young caterpillars are eating.'' `` I just caused a species name to go extinct,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. `` Nemoria aemularia, was the summer form,'' he said. `` Now both forms are called nemoria arizonaria.'' The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> scientist normally studies birds and said in a telephone interview that he `` stumbled'' into his caterpillar discovery while gathering data on the diet of birds living near <LOCATION> Portal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> `` I was finding lots of caterpillars and I had to raise them to produce an adult form that could be identified,'' said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. `` While doing this, I realized that something much more interesting was going on.'' The caterpillars are just bite-sized for birds, said <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>. About half of each season's caterpillar hatch is gobbled up, he said, and this may explain why the insect developed such a clever camouflage strategy. `` Birds are a major source of mortality for the caterpillars, so being very well hidden can pay off,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. The nemoria arizonaria caterpillar lives in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The adult form is a brillant emerald moth with a one-inch wingspan. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said it is commonly seen at night on windows and screens in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Science, which published <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s study, is the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler </PERSON> says her mother encouraged her, but her father did n't think much of her career choice. `` -LRB- My father -RRB- was one of those pooh-poohers _ ` You'll never amount to a hill of beans.'

<HEAD>Minor Bumps Could Cost Thousands on 1989 Small Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Minor accidents that would have caused no damage to a 1981 small car can bring a big repair bill for 1989 models, according to insurance industry tests. The <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> intentionally crashed 19 new 1989 two-door cars at 5 mph into two flat barriers, once going forward and once backward, and then bumped the front end of each car into an angle barrier and the back end into a post. Damage estimates calculated in January ranged from $ 3,445 for an <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Impulse </ORGANIZATION> to $ 434 for a Geo Spectrum. Identical tests on a new Ford Escort in 1981 caused no damage, institute spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said Thursday. A 1989 Ford Escort suffered no damage in the straight-on barrier tests but the repair cost after the other two tests totaled $ 1,481. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said the low-speed tests were conducted over the past month at test facilities in <LOCATION> Hartwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, using new cars purchased anonymously by the institute, which is financed by the insurance industry. The highest repair estimates were for the Isuzu Impulse, the <ORGANIZATION> Daihatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charade </ORGANIZATION> at $ 3,047 and the <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> CRX HF at $ 3,040. The least damaged cars after the Geo Spectrum were the Toyota Corolla with $ 495 in damage and the Plymouth Colt with $ 642. Prior to the 1983 model year, federal law required that cars sustain no damage in 5 mph front and rear barrier tests. For newer models, the standard was lowered to 2.5 mph. Nine cars sustained no damage at all in the front and rear barrier tests in the 1989 study but all were damaged when nudged up against the angle barrier and pole. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Stinson </PERSON> said the difference in damage to the Escort is due to changes in the model that include a lightweight bumper to help <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> meet federally imposed mileage standards. Lighter cars use less gas. She said the pole and angle tests are `` very tough'' but <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has voluntarily built other models to comply with the pre-1983 standard for straight-on barrier crashes rather than the less-stringent 2.5 mph standard. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Isuzu </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON>, said the company had requested documentation on the testing and would not respond until it could study the material. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonius </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the CRX HF model is designed for fuel economy with a lighter bumper but other <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> models have stronger bumpers than last year. `` The most important thing is that this is not related to auto safety,'' he said. The tests did not cover any injuries that might occur to driver or passengers in low-speed crashes. The institute said a basic 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> CRX </ORGANIZATION> model suffered $ 2,061 in damage, compared with $ 2,782 damage in a previous test on a 1988 model of the same car. `` This improvement is encouraging,'' said <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, `` but there was still a lot of damage to the'89 and a very long way to go.'' The fourth most-damaged car, a Chrysler Conquest TSi, with a repair estimate totaling $ 2,357, required a new front fender costing $ 300. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> noted that the mass-produced sheet-metal fender costs as much as a washing machine which `` comes complete with motor, pump, hoses and circuitry as well as the metal housing.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said he could not comment on the results without knowing more about criteria used for the tests and damage estimates.

<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary-designate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> says he let a tobacco company pay for an inaugural reception for him without thinking about whether it would be a conflict of interest. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that he was so busy wrapping up his work as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and preparing to become agriculture secretary for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that `` it totally disappeared from my attention screen.'' <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, staged the reception Jan. 18 for <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, saying it wanted to celebrate his appointment as agriculture secretary. Federal ethics rules forbid government officials from accepting anything of value from anyone who could be affected by the official's actions. As trade representative, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> aggressively promoted overseas sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco products; as agriculture secretary he would be responsible for policies directly affecting <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> business interests. The reception arrangement was reported Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., questioned <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> about the possible conflict of interest during a confirmation hearing `` When <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> suggested that they would like to hold some kind of event in my honor because of all the work we had been doing in the international trade arena ... I could see no conflict of interest problems in them doing so because I was fully intending to go back to the private sector,'' said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. `` When the event was agreed to, it simply did not ring any conflict of interest bells,'' he said, noting that it was held in the final hours of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term. `` You are not going to be causing any conflicts of interest in the final 24 hours of an administration.'' He said then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked him to be agriculture secretary after he had accepted <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' invitation. `` We probably should have reconsidered because of my expected continuation in government. ... Frankly, I just did n't think about it,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> from 1978 to 1985, when he became trade representative. Asked about the current <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of alleged fraud in futures trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he did n't know the probe was under way while he was its president. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began its undercover investigation of brokers in <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s last year at the exchange. `` Some complaints surface almost every week of the year and they are brought before a disciplinary committee,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Most are fruitless. Some have validity and sanctions are applied upon those against whom charges are levied. `` I was not aware this was a widespread problem,'' he said. `` I know no more than what is in the newspapers.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> emphasized throughout the hearing the importance of holding down federal spending in agriculture and finding more foreign markets for American products. `` We have to find ways to permit American farmers to earn income from the marketplace and depend less on the federal government,'' he said. `` We have had too high a reliance on government by farmers in this country.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also discussed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, saying `` We are not about to abandon any import constraints in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unless there is quid pro quo in other countries, giving us export opportunities. It's a horse trade.'' On rural development, he said: `` The push and initiative should come from local areas. We can help coordinate and provide technical assistance'' but he said the federal government does not have billions of dollars to put into helping farm communities diversify.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jose </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has filed a lawsuit demanding that 500 officers be added to the police force in response to the recent deaths of two patrolmen in a shootout with a transient. The association, which represents 970 of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>'s 1,014-member police force, said the current level of 1.36 officers per 1,000 residents in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> is inadequate to assure reasonable police and public safety and is far below the national average of 2.58 officers per 1,000. Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McEnery </PERSON> called the association's demand for a 50 percent increase, spelled out in a lawsuit filed Thursday, `` fiscally impossible and unrealistic.'' In making the demand, which is estimated to cost $ 25 million annually, the association is relying on a state labor code provision requiring employers to adopt reasonable safety standards for workers. It may be the first such use of the provision. With a total of 1,500 officers, the force would have about two officers per 1,000 population. More than 742,000 people live in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. The City Council on Thursday approved <PERSON> McEnery </PERSON>'s request for 15 more officers this spring as part of the mid-year budget review. The mayor said he plans to ask the council for an addition 40 to 50 officers. <PERSON> Carm </PERSON> <PERSON> Grande </PERSON>, president of the association, conceded the hiring of 500 officers at one time is `` an impossible project'' and said the association was willing to negotiate a time period when that many officers could be added. The lawsuit filed in <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which names as defendants the city, <PERSON> McEnery </PERSON>, the city manager and the city council, added fuel to a heated debate over police staffing and procedures since the Jan. 20 gun battle in which Officers <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> were killed along with gunman <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Randell </PERSON> <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> was shot with his own gun when <PERSON> Connors </PERSON>, a transient, grabbed the weapon during a struggle. In its suit, the association also asked for two officers per patrol car, but <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> said he would drop that demand if the city agreed to hire 500 more officers. <PERSON> McEnery </PERSON> dismissed the need for so many more police, arguing that despite the recent shootings <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> is `` the safest big city in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report last July showed that <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> has only six violent crimes per 1,000 population, far below <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s 25.4 per thousand, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>'s 22.4, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 20.4, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s 19.6 and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' 19.1 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> also had the lowest homicide rate of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 10 largest cities in 1987, when it had 26 killings. The city had 30 killings in 1988, but already has 13 so far this year, <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> said the officers chose to fight the city in court after getting nowhere in negotiations. `` The mayor has indicated over the past years that he supports the police department but we see nothing forthcoming from his office,'' <PERSON> Grande </PERSON> said.

Volume was estimated at an active $ 7.5 billion, compared to an average daily volume of $ 5 billion. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 137.62-point winner the previous day, garnered another 178.48 points to close the week at a record 31,685.48. The previous high of 31,646.13 points was set on Jan. 27. Volume was estimated at 2.0 billion shares, a three-month high. `` The gradual recovery of the yen, we believe, stems from the market's expectations that the dollar would somewhat soften after reaching a peak at a time when major monetary countries in the Group of Seven are meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Takamasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The dealer said market participants were expecting the seven countries to reach agreement on the need to maintain currencies at a stable level as the dollar inched down in value against the yen and the German mark. `` The dollar's overnight retreat in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> also tempted selling of the dollar,'' <PERSON> Yamasaki </PERSON> said. Bolstered by active stock purchases by foreign investors, trading was brisk with construction and related issues showing continued vigor, said <PERSON> Toshiyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishiguchi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Stocks also rallied following news reports that Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, in a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, pledged to further stimulate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s domestic demand, <PERSON> Nishiguchi </PERSON> said.

 An Afghan guerrilla leader says President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime will fold shortly after the Soviet army's departure, and guerrillas are making plans to secure the major cities without large-scale attacks <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, leader of the guerrilla group <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, said the government `` will fall in weeks, not months.'' He addressed a news conference in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, a frontier city where a seven-party guerrilla alliance has its headquarters. Neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, meanwhile, urged the factions to end their squabbles and form a broad-based government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> when the Soviet withdrawal is completed. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> support the guerrillas. The Soviet army is due to complete its withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15 under a U.N.-brokered accord signed last April. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said the insurgents were determined to avoid attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the Afghan capital, and other cities that would endanger civilian lives. More than 2 million people, including many refugees, have crammed into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. `` The whole world will be witness to the fact that <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will fall without any major onslaught on the city,'' <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, a senior military leader, said field commanders will need plans for the administration of towns and cities that fall to them, for bringing in food, and keeping water and power systems operating. `` Before we knew only to attack the Russians,'' he said in an interview. `` Now we must secure the nation, establish law and order, feed the people, stop looting or killing. It is very difficult.'' He said the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> regime was preparing to defend itself and about 5,000 special troopers had returned from training in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in house-to-house fighting. The government also is strengthening such elite formations as the presidential guard and secret police militia, <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s conscript army shows signs of collapse and is of little use for major operations, he said, adding that government forces generally are confined to cities and large towns, leaving the countryside to the guerrillas. <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said the guerrillas must find a way army units can surrender safely and without fear of reprisal so they will not be compelled to fight. `` We should not make them fight for survival,'' he said. <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON> told the news conference there were arrangements for securing the fall of major cities without large-scale attacks, but gave no details. Other guerrilla groups said they were unaware of such plans. Most of the nation's industry, agriculture and public facilities have been destroyed by the civil war, which began after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers intervened in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 were in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> when the withdrawal began in May under a U.N.-mediated agreement. Members of the seven-party alliance are trying to reach agreement on a provisional government, but are deeply divided on sharing power and other important issues. <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Thursday in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> efforts were under way to form an interim government. He indicated there were problems, but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, appealed for guerrilla unity after two days of meetings in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> that ended Thursday, Pakistani diplomats said. A coalition of eight resistance groups is based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Most of the guerrillas in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> are Shiite Moslems, and those in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> largely follow the predominant Sunni branch of Islam.

<TEXT>
 President Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s longest ruling leader, was placed under arrest early Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> after it staged a rebellion, a spokesman for the opposition claimed. Infantry divisions in three interior cities and an air force unit sided with rebels after shooting broke out late Thursday and lasted more than six hours. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, `` is a prisoner ... and Gen. -LRB- <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is in complete control of the situation,'' said the opposition political leader, speaking on condition of anonymity. The report on the detention of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who has ruled since 1954, could not immediately be confirmed. The government issued no statement from the time gunfire began at a military base and tanks rumbled through this semitropical capital of 900,000, firing on the headquarters of the police and presidential guard. Two planes flew low over the capital early Friday but did not participate in the fighting. There was no immediate word on casualties. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, commander of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement, but it did not mention specific goals or motivations, nor did it specify whether he was acting against <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> personally. `` Dear countrymen, appreciated comrades of the armed forces, we have left our barracks in defense of the dignity and the honor of the armed forces, for the full and total unification of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, for the initiation of democratization in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, for the respect of human rights, and for the defense of our Roman Catholic religion.'' <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s No. 2 military commander, is identified with a faction within the ruling party that favors limited democratic reforms. Diplomats and political sources said earlier Thursday that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> for undetermined reasons apparently was ordered to give up his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister. He refused. His statement was broadcast repeatedly by <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Primera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marzo </ORGANIZATION>, one of two stations that stayed on the air. Residents quickly deserted downtown streets on a steamy summer night when firefights involving cannon, recoilless rifles and heavy machine guns broke out in the most serious incident against <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> since he took power. The revolt by the army's largest and best-armed corps appeared to catch <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the army commander, by surprise. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, in his statement, asked citizens to remain calm. Shooting was first heard at 9:45 p.m. -LRB- 7:45 p.m. EST -RRB- in front of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' base in <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pyta </LOCATION>, four miles to the north, and continued early today. Some residents fled their homes, and witnesses reported seeing 40 to 50 tanks leave the base and rumble downtown, where exchanges of gunfire continued past midnight. `` We're all keeping our heads down. We can hear mortar rounds landing'' at the presidential escort battalion, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat. The embassy and escort battalion are near one another on <PERSON> Avenida </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariscal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, lined with fine homes and old mango trees. The Roman Catholic station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> reported early Friday that heavy smoke could be seen from the quarters of the presidential guard. Later, the station reported electricity was cut in its sector of town. `` Return home and pray ... that nothing worse happens,'' the Rev. Pastor <PERSON> Cuquejo </PERSON>, auxiliary archbishop of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, urged Paraguayans in a radio address. Later, the bells of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> tolled briefly in the traditional call for prayer. The rebellion comes as <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> is in ill health following surgery for a prostate operation five months ago. The stocky, vigorous general in recent months has worked fewer hours, seen fewer people, delegated more work to subordinates and looked pale and weak. The revolt follows a festering dispute within the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> between a militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalists who wanted to distance the 100-year-old party from the unpopular, authoritarian general. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest opposition group, said the fighting `` has something to do with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and -LRB- <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Montonaro </PERSON>,'' who is interior minister and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Montonaro </PERSON> leads the party's militant faction, which took over party leadership in a divisive national congress in August 1987 and since has purged its opponents from positions of power. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is considered close to the traditionalist faction. The military and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> control nearly all facets of life in the California-sized nation of nearly 4 million between <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> toppled <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON> in 1954. The last unrest in the military occurred in 1962, when a cadet was slain outside the capital.

 Riot police arrested nine people during a second night of arson and rock-and-bottle throwing that erupted in a mostly black neighborhood following reports a suspected drug dealer died in police custody. `` The message is very clear. You come over here and incite riots, you're going to get arrested,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> after police controlled the disturbance Thursday. About 70 police officers cordoned off the <LOCATION> College </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> neighorhood for nearly three hours after sunset. An officer hit by a brick, Sgt. <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, was treated at <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and released. `` It was very sporadic. Nothing on a major scale. It was kind of hit and run,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sluga </PERSON>. The Tampa incidents came as residents and officials in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> seek to maintain calm in the city's <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> districts, the scene of three days of rioting last month following the fatal shooting of a black motorcyclist by a policeman. The College Hill neighborhood, the site of at least a half dozen violent outbreaks in the past two years, erupted in a three-hour melee Wednesday night following the drug arrest of <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 40, who later died of a cardiac arrest. `` People feel trapped and they're ready to explode when something even looks like brutality,'' said <PERSON> Eliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, pastor of Blessed Hope Ministries two blocks from a looted grocery store. `` We're still sitting on a keg of dynamite down here. A mob of youths began throwing rocks and bottles at the officers who struggled to subdue Price, a 6-foot-3, 300-pound black man from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Eight officers were finally called in to capture Price in the living room of his girlfriend's mother. The girl's mother, a heart patient with a pacemaker who uses a walker, ended up under the pileup on the floor. She was not injured. Price, who suffered a two-inch gash in his head during the struggle, began experiencing heart trouble in a police cruiser shortly after his arrest. He died about 90 minutes later at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Police said Price was not beaten or choked during the arrest, and an autopsy was being performed to substantiate the cause of death. `` We wanted to dispel any rumors we beat a man to death,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> McLane </PERSON>. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Diggs </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> medical examiner, said preliminary autopsy results suggest Price may have suffocated in the police cruiser because his breathing was constricted due to being handcuffed. Price was carrying 25 pieces of crack cocaine and a loaded .25 - caliber derringer in his pockets, said police spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> Price was sentenced in 1974 to 50 years on a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> robbery conviction and also had a 1967 robbery arrest on his record, said <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. He did not know the disposition of that case. During Wednesday night's unrest, an estimated 75 young people threw rocks and bottles, fired at least two gunshots at a television news van and looted and burned a grocery store. Officials cordoned off four intersections in the 22-block housing development and summoned 100 police officers and 30 firefighters. At least four officers received minor injuries, and a 21-year-old man was arrested on charges of inciting to riot, disorderly conduct and drinking in public. There was no official estimate of the size of the crowd involved in Thursday's unrest, although it was believed smaller than the 50 to 75 youths believed involved in Wednesday's unrest. Among the nine people arrested were four members of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. Last April, a crowd of 400 threw rocks and bottles following the arrest of a robbery suspect in the neighborhood, and violence erupted in February 1987 after a 23-year-old black man died in police custody. A white police officer who used a neck hold to subdue him eventually was cleared of wrongdoing, but the neck hold was banned.

<HEAD>U.S. To Help Clean Oil Spill That Threatens Delicate Ecosystem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts were en route today to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> to clean an oil spill that threatens the delicate ecosystem, but an environmentalist said only a few weeks remain before the area's frigid waters begin to freeze. A giant C-5 cargo plane flew the crew and 52 tons of cleanup gear to the southern port of <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arenas </LOCATION> on Thursday. The crew was to board on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research ship departing today for the spill, about 590 miles south of the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> staff for the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, said the vessel Polar <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> would take about four days to reach the spill, just off the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> and about two miles from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientific base Palmer Station. However, a <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman cautioned that less than two months remain to contain the damage. `` They ca n't hang around too long,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON> from the <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> ship <LOCATION> Gondwana </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> waters. `` By mid - to late-April the ice will start to freeze over. `` Any ship that's underwater in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> with that amount of fuel poses a big problem,'' he said in a radio telephone interview to <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The environmental group is calling for an international effort to contain damage caused by the sinking Tuesday of an Argentine navy vessel that, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, was carrying 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel. In a stop in <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> on Thursday, <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON> told reporters the crew would focus efforts on saving baby penguins in the polluted area. `` All the young penguins are just about at the age where they take their first swim,'' he said. `` When these birds enter the water for the first time, it could be the last time.'' The 9,300-ton Paradise Bay was leaking fuel oil at an undetermined rate, and hundreds of drums of oil and canisters of compressed gas had slipped from its decks, the foundation said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Argentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday, `` There really was n't a -LRB- significant -RRB- spill.'' An Argentine navy statement said an icebreaker was to arrive at the scene today to `` assess the best ways available to combat the pollution.'' Some environmental experts and scientific groups have said hundreds of gallons of fuel leaked from the ship and created a slick up to 16 miles long, but the Chilean navy said the reports appeared exaggerated. `` The information that we have is that there is no big spill,'' said a navy snnel at <LOCATION> Palmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> were gathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from around the grounded ship. `` The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200 barrels in the water,'' <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. `` And there's still oil coming out of the ship.'' <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the cleanup mission and directs all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> activities in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, feared lasting environmental damage. Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick had caused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface, <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Inderbitzen </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>'s unspoiled environment requires special measures to contain the spill, which is near two areas set aside for scientific study under terms of the Antarctic Treaty. `` In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals to recover from an accident,'' he said. `` But in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>, it takes plants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold. It's a very, very fragile environment.'' The crew has a 35-foot `` skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil and pumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat and inflatable booms to contain drifting oil. The cleanup work will be peformed by <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pollution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, under contract to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Renirie </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 If and when the Afghan insurgents slip out of the mountains and attempt to take this capital city, the government's last line of defense will be a politically select and specially trained elite guard. But like much else in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the most important questions about the guard _ how motivated, well-equipped and trained it is _ have no certain answers. As artillery fire greeted one of the final Soviet convoys to move up the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> toward the Soviet border Thursday, soldiers of the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> special guard were training at a former Soviet military base in the center of the city. Some soldiers lay sprawled on the ground as drills were conducted on a paved square. Many troops smiled at Western reporters or at each other as about 50 staged a drill of mounting six armored cars directly behind them. The uniforms did not match. Some of those taking part in the drill by the armored cars were dressed in brown uniforms while others wore khaki-colored padded jackets. Males and females as young as 17 or as old as 45 can volunteer for the force. But some of the soldiers looked younger and others much older. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Asin </PERSON>, the group's chief political officer, told reporters, `` We will defend the city ... if necessary.'' `` After the withdrawal of the Soviet soldiers, we will be able to defend the country,'' said the general, who was dressed in fresh camouflage gear and shiny brown leather loafers. If the resistance `` wants to impose war on us, there will be a reaction,'' he said. Soviet troops are due to be out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15 under the terms of a U.N.-brokered agreement signed last April. Western observers have said the Afghan government force suffers from high defections and low morale, and is ill-prepared to fight the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> - and Pakistan-backed rebels If the rebels are able to close in on this dusty capital in the weeks after the Soviet withdrawal is completed, it is not certan whether they will try to slowly squeeze the city into submission or try to take it with an all-out assault. In any case, it is the special guard's task to defend the capital. The guard was formed several months ago on orders of the office of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, whose pro-Soviet government is being pressed by the rebels as the Soviet soldiers leave. Sources in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> have said the original units of the special guard were formed from the best of Afghan military units, but that recent additions to the force have consisted primarily of raw recruits. <PERSON> Asin </PERSON> said the force still is gaining members and eventually will number more than 10,000 troops. The troops receive training in artillery tactics and other military specialties as well as infantry training, officers said. The majority are members of <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Afghanistan </ORGANIZATION>, its youth organization or affiliates, <PERSON> Asin </PERSON> said. The rest he described as `` Afghan patriots.'' One of the duties of the special guard is to protect the president himself. The 42-year-old general did not say how much soldiers are paid in the special guard, but denied money was a factor in attracting soldiers. The military base in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> serves as a reminder of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s long history of struggle involving foreign powers An obelisk built at the camp pays tribute to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers who have fought in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. And high on a hill overlooking the base stands the ruins of an ancient stone fort where the Afghans say hundreds of British soldiers died in 1878 during a British-Afghan war. Members of the special guard already have been involved in combat. <PERSON> Asin </PERSON> said one man was wounded in heavy fighting along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> last week. The highway is the only ground route for the departing Soviet troops, and Afghan and Soviet forces have been fighting to keep it open.

 A strong explosion ripped through a shrine in central <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, shattering windows and causing part of the ceiling to collapse, police said. No injuries were reported. The pre-dawn blast shattered more than a dozen windows and burned a covered passageway at the <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shrine </LOCATION>, said a police official who spoke on condiiton of anonymity. Parts of a fire extinguisher, electrical wires and welding materials, which could have been used in making a bomb, were found near the shrine's main building, the official said. However, he refused to confirm if police suspect radicals bombed the <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shrine </LOCATION>, a Shinto shrine, because of its close association with militarism and loyalty to the emperor. Ultraleftist groups have been linked by police to at least seven incidents since the death last month of Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION> Shrine was founded in memory of <LOCATION> Heihachiro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, an admiral during the Russo-Japanese War who commanded the interception and destruction of the Russian Baltic Fleet in the Battle of <LOCATION> Tsushima </LOCATION> in 1905. <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION> was in charge of educating <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> from 1914 until 1924, and was known for his loyalty to the monarchy. He died in 1934. The shrine is located less than a mile from the site where <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s state funeral will be held Feb. 24. <PERSON> Teruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuhashi </PERSON>, a priest at the shrine, said two priests were staying at the shrine when the explosion occured and 20 more employees were asleep in an annex, which was undamaged. `` I do n't know why they would want to attack us,'' <PERSON> Matsuhashi </PERSON> said

Relatives of <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valens </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> on Thursday for a private showing of the sculptures, to be followed by a public unveiling and concert in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> today on the 30th anniversary of their deaths. `` This is really an honor,'' said <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON>'s widow `` I have no words to express. It is very touching. He would be so proud. He would be crying to be in such good company.'' `` There's no way I can express,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Valens </PERSON>' brother. `` He'd love it. It's the most beautiful thing he could see.'' The musicians were killed on Feb. 3, 1959, when their small plane crashed in bad weather near <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, en route to a concert date in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> was a giant on the fledgling rock' n'roll scene and his death became known as `` the day the music died. <PERSON> Valens </PERSON> was a budding star famous for his hit `` La Bamba.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who was from <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, was known as `` The Big Bopper'' and recently had earned a gold record for his hit song `` Chantilly Lace.'' `` He was my hero,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> businessman credited with being the force behind the memorials. `` These guys were budding stars and then they were gone _ whammo! It's frightening and it can happen to anybody To think the only memorial to these guys is here, it shakes me. I'm so happy.'' The life-size sculptures were made by <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> artist <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> for the city's historical society, which began its sculpture collection last year with <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>'s portait of rock queen <PERSON> Janis </PERSON> <PERSON> Joplin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> native who died in 1970. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said he worked from videotapes of <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> and from photos of <PERSON> Valens </PERSON>. His pose of the three _ with the Bopper's arms around <LOCATION> Valens </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> _ is intended to show the trio as if they were standing for a picture just before boarding the fateful flight to <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> `` I do n't know that there really is such a picture,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said. `` But I could just imagine someone getting one last shot before they got on the airplane.'' A second sculpture of <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> alone shows the wide-eyed grinning singer with a guitar at his waist and his arms wide open. Proceeds from today's event will go toward the purchase of a $ 50,000 building for a <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> museum that would include rock' n' roll memorabilia. Until the museum is built, the sculptures will stand in a local library.

 A bovine version of the peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich may help keep hay from spoiling and make it more nutritious and delicious for cattle. Researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbondale </ORGANIZATION> are spreading a substance that resembles peanut butter onto bales of hay to see if it shields the hay from rain and snow and reduces spoiling.

The product, called `` balebutter'' because it resembles peanut butter, consists of soybean oil and minerals. `` Not only does it have the capacity to cut down on hay loss, but it also utilizes agricultural products,'' <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said recently. `` We need to find new uses for soybeans.'' <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON> said a farmer, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Halford </PERSON>, developed balebutter and brought it to the university for evaluation. `` We're still investigating,'' said <PERSON> Wolff </PERSON>. `` We do n't know yet if it has fantastic potential or it does n't.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> jet taking off from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>'s Mingaladon Airport struck a tree and crashed today, killing 26 people on board and injuring three, state radio said. Four people on the ground also were injured when the turboprop jet crashed near housing for families of air force personnel, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said. The radio gave engine failure as the cause of the crash, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s fourth since mid-1987, and said the accident was being investigated It said the plane failed to gain height and hit a 15-foot tree shortly after taking off on a flight for <LOCATION> Kengtung </LOCATION>, 380 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The plane then swerved to the left and plowed through trees and electric lines, it said. The aircraft, a Dutch-made <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 27, carried 25 passengers and four crew members. The radio report did not identify the three survivors. All on board were presumed to be Burmese nationals since <LOCATION> Kengtung </LOCATION> is normally off limits to foreigners due to security problems in the area. <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> has lost four <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 27s since June 21, 1987 when 45 people were killed after take-off from Heho airport in the <LOCATION> Shan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. All 49 people on board were killed near <LOCATION> Pagan </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in a crash on Oct. 11, 1987. Last June 16, a chartered aircraft crashed on a flight from <LOCATION> Myitkyina </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Putao </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and all four aboard were killed. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s tiny fleet of eight aircraft is plagued by a shortage of spare parts and poor maintenance.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> used his inauguration ceremony to appeal to Latin American leaders to form a united front on the $ 410 billion they owe foreign creditors. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who took office Thursday, will host today's meeting on the region's debt crisis with the presidents of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> and foreignministers of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 First there were the whales, trapped in an ice-bound sea as red-nosed reporters from around the world shivered in wait. Then things really got cold, again chilling <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s efforts to warm its frosty image <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON>, a public relations consultant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said he was watching television this week when he noticed some startling mixed messages about <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` The weather report had just been on and they were reporting these ghastly temperatures in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> recalled Thursday. `` The very next thing after the weather report was a commercial to promote tourism in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>.'' The commercial <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> saw features a southern governor enjoying a sunny barbecue along a scenic <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> bay. There's blue sky, lush forest and not a hint of snow or ice. The governor has been away from his home state a bit too long, and when his parka-clad aides track him down he jokes that they're `` a little bit overdressed.'' `` They're clever commercials, but they were just out of sync that particular day,'' <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON> said. That's the attitude state officials hope potential tourists adopt as they plan their summer vacations. They say they do n't believe the publicity will lead to fewer tourists visiting the nation's largest state, which bills itself as `` The Last Frontier.'' `` Weather stories come along all the time. They have a passing effect on people's thinking,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gellert </PERSON>, director of the state Tourism Division. But the past several months have focused an unusual amount of national attention on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, all of it having to do with ice. Before the record cold wave, there was the effort last fall to save the trapped whales near <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. Telecasts of shivering reporters on the windy and frozen Arctic tundra did nothing to warm the hearts of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s tourism officials. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> advertising firm that handles the state's tourism ad campaign, said those scenes reinforce a negative image of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> among residents in the lower 48 states. `` They still think we live in igloos and drive dog teams. There's an ingrained bias there,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said `` We're the most misunderstood state in the union, there's no doubt about it.'' <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> will spend about $ 7.6 million on tourism promotion this year. Of that, $ 2.5 million is being spent on the television ads in major urban markets and on cable. The ad campaign is part of a long-term effort to change <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s image It is based on extensive research showing many potential tourists do n't come to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> because they think it's too cold. `` The intent of those ads is not to say it's not cold ever in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but to say this is not a year-round land of ice and snow. We have some parts of the year when its warm, sunny, and all the nice colors come out,'' <PERSON> Gellert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, says the commercials are under review and the `` weather strategy'' may be replaced next year. He says the icy publicity may actually draw tourists. `` In many cases in enhances people's interest in coming in the summer,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He may be right. Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westours </ORGANIZATION>, the largest cruise ship company serving <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, reports heavy bookings in recent weeks for summer cruises to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Company spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that's because those buying <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> cruises know what to expect. `` They've looked at the literature to make sure they know what to wear and that sort of thing,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` They tend to be well-educated and much more erudite than the typical <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> cruiser would be.''

In firing <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, administrators cited a new AIDS policy requiring school employees suspected of carrying the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus to be tested and their cases reviewed by a committee of health and school officials. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Community Schools, said at a news conference Thursday that <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> would be allowed to continue coaching pending a decision by the school board whether his condition is a public health threat. But <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON> said he does n't think <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s condition `` constitutes an immediate health threat.'' He said he made the decision to reinstate <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> after speaking with the coach's physician, the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health officer and officials at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The school board was awaiting written confirmation of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s condition from his physician in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jobe </PERSON> said A final decision on whether <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> can stay on indefinitely is expected in about two weeks, he said. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> was diagnosed as having AIDS last June while undergoing a blood test in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. He contracted the deadly disease from tainted blood products used during open heart surgery in 1984. The parents of some of <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s players were upset he was suspended. `` Everybody is afraid of AIDS, but I do n't think breeding stupidity into our children will make it go away,'' said <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Cable </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Metamora </LOCATION>, whose 10-year-old son is on <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s team. `` It's been blown out of proportion,'' added <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrain </PERSON>, whose sixth-grade child is on the team. `` I do n't see anything wrong with him coaching the team. I'm not worried about it, but there's always a chance I guess.'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>, who launched a petition drive to be reinstated, said he was happy to go back to work. `` I really feel good about it. I believe their decision will come out in my favor.'' He said he was concerned that school officials _ fearing he would transmit AIDS to others _ would bar him from the school and would insist on testing his children, <PERSON> Dande </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, 14, for the AIDS virus. The disease, which attacks the body's immune system, is transmitted primarily through bodily fluids, such as during sexual contact, intravenous drug use and blood transfusions, but not through casual contact. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> had volunteered to coach the team of fourth -, fifth - and sixth-graders when his daughter decided to play at the school, 60 miles southeast of His wife, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON>, offered to substitute as coach while her husband's case was pending but was told that she, too, would have to undergo an AIDS test. `` I have no physical contact with them -LRB- team members -RRB- at all,'' <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. `` I might throw a basketball to them, but if they're going to get it that way, we're all in trouble. A similar argument was made after school authorities in <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> barred <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> from his classes in 1985 because he has AIDS. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> eventually won the legal right to return to classes, but his family soon moved to <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.

 Space shuttle Discovery was moved out of its hangar today on its way to a launch pad where technicians hope to replace three engine turbopumps in time for a mid-March liftoff. The earliest possible launch date is March 10. If the shuttle ca n't be launched by March 18, Discovery would be pulled back to a hangar, yielding the pad to <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>, whose crew is to dispatch the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> after a liftoff scheduled for April 28. Atlantis' planetary payload has priority over <ORGANIZATION> Discovery </ORGANIZATION>'s communications satellite because after May 23, <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> will not be in the proper alignment with Earth again until 1991 `` We are under pressure, but in this case it's good pressure because it will just make us be sure that we pay attention to all the details in that we know we have a point to meet. But we know we can make it,'' said B.K. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle engine manager at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` I think we're in good shape,'' Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administator for space flight, said Thursday at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> awards ceremony Discovery will `` fly sometime in the middle of March.'' Perched vertically on a giant tracked transporter, Discovery moved out of an assembly building into the darkness at 6 a.m. to begin a four-mile trip that was expected to take six to seven hours. The transporter, called a crawler, traveled at a maximum speed of 1 mph. Shuttle managers, who had been debating for several days what to do about Discovery's suspect turbopumps, decided Wednesday to replace all three of them on the launch pad in conjunction with other work. They also postponed the launch from late February to mid-March. The problem stems from an Atlantis flight in December. A post-flight inspection of the shuttle's engines disclosed two tiny cracks in a bearing housing in one of three high-speed turbopumps that convert liquid oxygen to a gas. Engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion resulting from moisture trapped inside the housing during the manufacturing process. Because two of Discovery's turbopumps underwent the same processing, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> decided to replace all three pumps with new, carefully-inspected units. The pumps are a critical component because the shuttle could explode if one failed during liftoff. In the past, turbopumps have been replaced while a shuttle was horizontal in a checkout building. But Discovery is now in a vertical position and, without previous experience, there is an uncertainty about how long the replacement will take. The new pumps are scheduled to arrive here the week of Feb. 12. Discovery will be commanded by astronaut <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>. With him will be <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>. During five days in space they are to release a communications satellite and conduct science and medical experiments.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Not Kidding With Bill To Give 12-Year-Olds Voting Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A state lawmaker has proposed that 12-year-olds be allowed to vote in state elections, saying arguments against her bill are the same ones once used by opponents of voting rights for women and blacks. `` It's kind of an adult supremacist attitude,'' state Rep. <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said Thursday as she introduced her bill calling for a constitutional amendment to be placed on the state ballot for the 1990 general election. `` Do I think it's going to be instantly agreed upon and pass? No,'' said <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` I think it's a concept that people have to think about.'' It did n't take much thinking for some legislators, like Rep. <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Omann </PERSON>, an Independent-Republican from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION>, to dismiss the idea, dubbed the kiddie vote bill. `` Is this a joke? They play a lot of jokes around here,'' said <PERSON> Omann </PERSON>, a freshman representative who is the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s youngest member at age 24. Pondering the possibilities, <PERSON> Omann </PERSON> asked, `` What does that mean for politicians? Shaking hands in elementary schools?'' The bill was n't taken as a joke by Secretary of State <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Growe </PERSON>, who oversees state elections. The proposal accomplishes more than raising the argument of who should be able to vote, she said. `` I also believe it is really a very dramatic way of calling attention to the fact that those who ca n't vote truly have no power,'' <PERSON> Growe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON>, who holds a doctorate in biophysics from <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and a master's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged that she and the bill's <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> author, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> did have much more in mind than children's suffrage `` I think that giving children the right to vote is an essential part of giving them additional political benefits. This route is just a little less paternalistic,'' she said. <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said there is nothing in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution that would prohibit lowering the voting age, since constitutional language only prohibits the denial of voting rights to those 18 or older. About whether most children under 18 are mature enough to cast a vote, <PERSON> Kahn </PERSON> said, `` The alternative is just because someone is 18 does n't mean they're mature enough to vote.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> today signed a law that will give large bonuses to lawmakers elected in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> 42 years ago who voluntarily retire, but officials said many of the aging politicians refuse to step down. A statement said the bill, part of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to increase the clout of native Taiwanese in the government, will take effect Monday The Nationalist government, which fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1949 after losing a civil war to Communist forces on the mainland, still claims to be the rightful ruler of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The elderly lawmakers, most of them Nationalists, have been frozen in office until they can return to their mainland constituencies for new elections. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a 100-year-old presidential adviser, signed up today to retire from the 880-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> `` to support the government reform,'' Assembly Secretary Gen. <PERSON> Irwine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, the oldest assemblyman, will receive a one-time payment of about $ 143,000, or more than five times his annual salary, for stepping down. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> told reporters only about 100 elderly members of the assembly _ an electoral college that meets every six years to choose the president _ are expected to retire this year. Approximately 700 more aging assemblymen will wait to consider retirement until after the next presidential election in May 1990, he said. Meanwhile, officials of the 297-seat <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yuan </ORGANIZATION> said about 70 of the body's 200 elderly members are expected to retire this year. Many others refuse to step down because they believe they still represent their mainland constituents, the officials said. The opposition party <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has attacked the retirement bill for failing to restrict pension payments to lawmakers who resign this year. But the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rejected the demand to avoid outraging the elderly legislators. Lawmakers elected on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> now account for 73 seats in the 297-seat Legislative Yuan and 106 seats in the 880-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Most other members were elected on the Chinese mainland. Legislation has yet to be introduced to increase the number of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s elected members in the two parliamentary bodies. The <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> proposed last week to increase the number of elected <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yuan </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers to 130 for the December election. Under the plan, Taiwan-elected lawmakers would rise to 150 by 1992, when all elderly lawmakers are expected to have retired.

 Mechanical problems may have caused the derailment that killed at least 15 people on a crowded passenger train, officials said today. Three cars of the 10-car, Dhaka-bound express train derailed Thursday at <LOCATION> Kumira </LOCATION>, 14 miles north of this port city. The official death toll rose to 15 today after two people died of their injuries in a <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> hospital. However, the independent newspaper <PERSON> Inquilab </PERSON> said at least 25 people were killed and more than 100 injured. Officials say about 70 people were injured. <PERSON> Inquilab </PERSON> said some bodies were reportedly removed from the scene either by their relatives or rescuers, and therefore remained unaccounted for. The government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sangbad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sangstha </ORGANIZATION> said the train was carrying at least 2,100 passengers, three times its authorized capacity, including many travelers riding on top of the train or clinging outside the doors. A railroad official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the generator under a first-class coach may have broken and gotten caught in the track, throwing the coach and two adjoining cars off the track. <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>'s police superintendent, <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Talukder </PERSON>, blamed defects in the train's frame and mechanical system. On Thursday night, <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sangbad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sangstha </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified railroad official who was traveling on the train as saying the derailment was caused by a defect in a dining car. The wreck happened less than three weeks after two trains collided head on near <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, killing 114 people in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s worst-known rail disaster The Jan. 15 crash also happened on the line linking <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION>, 135 miles southeast of the capital.

Dozens of cars and shop windows were shattered in the worst clash in three straight years of `` Eat the Rich'' protests against Thursday's glittering Opera Ball in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>'s famed opera house. `` I've never seen such mass aggression at a demonstration like this,'' said <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochenbichler </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s security police. Thousands of police equipped with helmets, plastic shields and metal barriers used rubber truncheons and water hoses to keep about 1,500 youths away from the ball, whose 7,000 guests paid up to $ 11,000 to attend. The youths kept up a constant attack on the authorities, hurling rocks, bottles and firebombs at about 2,200 police deployed to seal the opera house off from all but ball guests. Police said today that 27 policemen, including one with a fractured skull, and 22 demonstrators were injured. In addition, three journalists required hospital treatment, police said. The violence started after protesters chanting `` Fascists!'' failed to break through metal barriers and police cordons sealing off the Opera House in the city center. Police said at times the protesters beat drums to whip up protesters. Those detained were still in custody today, but were expected to be freed after formal charges are made, police said.

<HEAD>Government Warns Ban On Public Meetings Will Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military government today said it would keep its ban on public assembly as long as anti-government protesters continue their activities. `` There are elements who are bent to incite trouble at any given opportunity,'' government spokesman <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> told a news conference. He said some people had shouted anti-government slogans at the recent funeral of <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Naing </PERSON>, a hero of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s 1940s struggle for independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> announced the ban on public assembly would continue. The spokesman also said political parties and other groups could be prosecuted if they continue distributing pamphlets and videotapes in violation of existing registration laws. Some opposition party leaders have complained of government harassment. The military seized power on Sept. 18 and brutally put down nationwide pro-democracy demonstrations, killing 500 people, by government count. Diplomats estimated 1,000 people were killed. The new leaders have allowed the formation of more than 180 political parties and promised general elections but have not fixed a date. <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Sann </PERSON> said some political parties, insurgents and `` hostile foreign organizations'' were probably behind the spread of rumors that rebel commandos had infiltrated the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> area and that Soviet advisers were fighting with the <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> army against the Karens. The Karens are one of about a dozen ethnic minority groups fighting the central government for greater autonomy.

 A part-time stagehand convicted of killing another man with a karate kick to the neck was sentenced to up to four years in prison despite an emotional plea for mercy. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> <PERSON> Uviller </PERSON> on Thursday criticized <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>'s actions as a `` purposeless, unprovoked attack on a passive victim.'' She sentenced him to one and one-third to four years in prison. He will be eligible for parole in about 15 months. <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, 21, was convicted Dec. 17 of criminally negligent homicide, the least serious homicide charge, for allegedly kicking <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>, 24, in the neck during an angry exchange outside a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> bar. According to testimony, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON> to a fight the night of Jan. 24, 1988, after one of <PERSON> Klagsbrun </PERSON>'s friends insulted <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> for wearing combat boots.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Palestinian Minors Jailed For Weeks Without Bail</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Palestinian teen-agers from Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> are routinely held for weeks without bail on charges of throwing stones or erecting roadblocks, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> lawyer said today. In other cases, Palestinian children under 13, whom the law does not consider legally responsible for their acts, are held for days because their parents ca n't pay bail, said attorney <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lecker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lecker </PERSON> said an 11-year-old and two 13-year-olds were detained for five days each in a cell at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police headquarters because their parents could not come up with $ 415 bail. `` They are held eight to a cell, and it's dark,'' <PERSON> Lecker </PERSON> said, adding that his young clients have complained of being slapped in the face and kicked in the legs during interrogation. <PERSON> Dorit </PERSON> <PERSON> Beinish </PERSON>, a state attorney in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, defended the practice as legal. `` We have many cases of stone-throwing by minors. This is a new crime, part of the uprising, and punishments are more severe,'' she said in an interview. Ms. <PERSON> Beinish </PERSON> said she did not recall a case in which a youth was held without bail and later acquitted. Ms. <PERSON> Beinish </PERSON> also said she did not know of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> under 13 being held. `` If this happened, it was a mistake,'' she said. Police spokeswoman <PERSON> Nurit </PERSON> <PERSON> Buton </PERSON> said she would investigate <PERSON> Lecker </PERSON>'s allegations that children under 13 have been held. Asked about the charges of mistreatment during interrogation, she said each complaint was investigated by a special police unit. `` We have many complaints that have no basis at all, while in some cases there may be something to it,'' she said. Nine left-wing Israeli legislators have written a letter to Justice Minister <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON> asking that the practice of holding minors be stopped. `` Standards from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> are coming to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a legislator from the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. He spoke in an interview Thursday. <PERSON> Lecker </PERSON> said the practice began a year ago after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that minors _ those between the ages of 14 and 18 _ can be held without bail until the start of trial if they are charged with throwing stones. On Thursday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot and killed a 16-year-old Palestinian in clashes near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages of <LOCATION> Fahme </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Rai </PERSON>, the army said. Hospital officials identified the youth as <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamil </PERSON> <PERSON> Saabneh </PERSON>, and gave his age as 22. The death brought to 371 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising. Fifteen Israelis also have been killed.

 Prosecutors indicted a North Korean agent today for her alleged role in the bombing of a South Korean jetliner in 1987. Prosecutors said formal charges had been filed against <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon-hui </PERSON>, 27, who confessed to bombing a <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 that disappeared Nov. 29, 1987, near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> with 115 people on board. Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has said she received direct orders from <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, North Korean President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>'s son and heir apparent, to plant a time bomb on the KAL plane and commit suicide before she was arrested. She said the purpose of her mission was to disrupt the Olympic Games, which were held in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> in September and October. Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has been in the custody of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s main intelligence organization, the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION>, since she was extradited from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, where she was arrested at the airport. Prosecutors said Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> would face legal measures but not be jailed. Although international aviation rules require <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to put Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> on trial, officials here want to spare her punishment because she has shifted her allegiance and fully cooperated with the government inquiry into the bombing. Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and a male companion, traveling on forged Japanese passports, were among passengers on an early leg of the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> but disembarked before the jet disappeared near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. They took poison when police tried to question them at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The man died but Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> survived.

 The No. 2 army commander seized power today in a coup the official radio said ousted President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the longest ruling leader in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the second-in-command of the army and a close associate of Gen. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, said in a radio broadcast that <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s commander-in-chief for 34 years had surrendered. The announcement came after hours of gunfights and cannon fire in the capital's streets Thursday night between rebel soldiers backed by tanks and mortars and forces loyal to <PERSON> Stoessner </PERSON>. There was no official word on casualties, but residents who ventured out this morning saw bloodstains on the pavement. The country's borders were closed. The police headquarters was pockmarked with bullets from small arms fire, and metal shredded by the bullets hung from the modern <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> building behind the police station. `` Order has been re-established, and with it all the human values of our entire constitution will be respected,'' said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who is father-in-law to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s youngest son, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON>. `` I communicate to you that Gen. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> has surrendered and finds himself in perfect health, deprived of liberty, being shown all human rights, at a residence within the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in the broadcast. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said he was `` taking command of the country from this moment.'' Diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> for undetermined reasons apparently was ordered to give up his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister. He refused. The rebellion also followed a dispute within the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> between a militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalists who wanted to distance the 100-year-old party from the authoritarian general. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was monitoring the situation. `` We do n't like violence, of course, and we hope that whatever government emerges will embrace democracy.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, has been the absolute ruler of this landlocked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country since 1954. He was army commander-in-chief, doled out political favors and jobs to his allies and called anyone who opposed him a Marxist subversive. He frequently exiled political opponents. However, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, has been in poor health following prostate surgery five months ago. In an earlier radio communique, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said he and his men `` left our barracks in defense of the dignity and the honor of the armed forces, for the full and total unification of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, for the initiation of democratization in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> -LRB- and -RRB- for the respect of human rights.'' Early today, radio reports quoted an infantry division commander, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Otazu </PERSON>, as saying the uprising was not `` insubordination but a correction.'' Col. <PERSON> Dionisio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabello </PERSON> told March 1 radio he was the new air force commander and pledged allegiance to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. Infantry divisions in three interior cities _ <LOCATION> Villarrica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bautista </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> _ and an air force unit sided almost immediately with the rebels, the reports indicated. Soldiers today blocked the street in front of the National Palace near the central business district of this capital city of 900,000. The palace did not look like it sustained damage, but residents saw bloodstains on nearby streets. `` We're happy the government is gone, but we're sad that people had to die,'' said one woman, who added that the shelling and small arms fire had forced her to spend Thursday night in a restaurant. Spokesman for the National Accord, a coalition of business, church and political leaders who have called for democratic reforms, said a transitional military junta may be named today to govern until general elections are held. They spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who did not mention a transitional junta or elections, is identified with a faction within the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that favors limited democratic reforms. The uprising began late Thursday when the nation's largest military unit, the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, fired at the headquarters of the police and presidential guard in shooting that lasted until dawn. Residents of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> quickly deserted the streets when the firefights involving cannon, recoilless rifles and heavy machine guns broke out. Witnesses reported seeing 40 to 50 tanks rumble downtown. `` We're all keeping our heads down. We can hear mortar rounds landing'' at the presidential escort battalion, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat said. The embassy is located between the battalion and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s official residence <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It has something to do with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and -LRB- <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Montonaro </PERSON>,'' who is the interior minister and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Montonaro </PERSON> leads the militant faction, which took over party leadership in August 1987 and since has purged its opponents from positions of power. The military and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> control nearly all facets of life in the California-sized nation of nearly 4 million between <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. Although closely allied with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was criticized for human rights abuses by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1986. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> toppled President <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> in 1954.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> crewmen reported a faulty fuel tank before they ejected from an FB-111 fighter-bomber that crashed and exploded in northeastern <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on a training mission, a congressman's aide said.

Officials said a military board has been established to investigate the crash. The pilot and navigator ejected together in a single capsule, called a pod.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have held secret negotiations recently on improving relations and discussed the possibility of a meeting between their leaders, newspaper reports said today. The reports come two days after the announcement of an unprecedented trade agreement involving <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the South Korean conglomerate <PERSON> Hyndai </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government said today the agreement may pave the way toward national unification after 44 years of bitter rivalry. Local newspapers quoted an unidentified government source as saying the secret talks were held overseas and covered most major issues between the countries. The most recent talks, the newspapers said, were in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> last week between <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chul-un </LOCATION>, a special secretary to South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, and an unidentified senior North Korean official. During his stay in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> from Jan. 24 to Jan. 30, <PERSON> Park </PERSON> met with his North Korean partner several times and discussed major pending issues, including a proposed summit between the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION>, the reports said. The newspapers quoted the government source as saying the summit could take place by the end of this year. Last month, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> renewed a proposal that he and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> meet to discuss the future of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, which has been divided into the communist North and capitalist South since 1945. The reported secret talks coincided with the historic visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> by a leading South Korean industrialist to discuss direct investment and joint venture projects. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju-yung </PERSON>, founder and honorary chairman of the giant <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> group, was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from Jan. 23 to Feb. 1 as a guest of the government. He announced Thursday he had agreed with North Korean officials to undertake several joint venture projects in that country, including a shipyard, a railroad plant and development of a tourist resort. Newspapers quoted unidentified government officials as saying tours would be available later this year to the planned resort area, a rugged scenic region 20 miles north of the eastern boundary of the zone separating the Koreas. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government said it would propose special legislation to facilitate the projects. In a statement today, the government said it `` in principle takes a favorable view of the proposed projects, regarding them as possible pilot projects that could contribute to efforts to achieve national unification.'' <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> was believed to be the first <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> business leader approved by both governments to visit the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> since the division of the peninsula. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s participation in the deal is seen as an attempt to revive its sagging economy. The North reportedly owes about $ 5 billion to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and Western nations. Figures published today and attributed to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government showed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> with a trade deficit of $ 720 million in 1987. Exports were listed at $ 1.67 billion and imports at $ 2.39 billion. The agreement, in the form of a protocol, was signed by <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Su </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Taesong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and consultant to the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of the Promotion of Asian Trade. Officials, requesting anonymity, also said the government had ordered a special study of the security problems involved in trade and personnel exchanges with the North. Under South Korean law, contact with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is a violation of national security. The two nations are technically still at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the three-year Korean War in 1953. Each claims to be the sole legitimate government of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Cult Figure Of Hughes Aircraft Unmasked In Houston</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fast track at <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> was too much for <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, but life in the slow lane did not hold the appeal fantasized by his former colleagues when the young executive left without a trace in 1981. The man who had become a cult figure to corporate daydreamers was tracked down by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents last October in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, masquerading under the name of <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> and working quietly at a small oil exploration firm. `` I hurt a lot of people _ my parents, my ex-wife and my kids,'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, 40, said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times this week. `` I really regret doing this. If I had to do it over again, I would do it differently.'' He vanished on Sept. 10, 1981, leaving behind his engineering job, his parents, his wife and two kids and taking a flight to Ft.. <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Before he left, he told a co-worker, `` Never become too good at something you They'll make you do it the rest of your life.'' After he left, his former colleagues, some of whom said they wished they had the courage to do the same, began throwing annual parties, often showing up at them wearing <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> masks. No one from his past saw or heard from him again until <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, trying to learn why someone in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was using the name of <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, tracked him to his office at <ORGANIZATION> Input-Output </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> first lived in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for a time, fixing boat engines and hanging out at the beach. `` There are a lot of pretty girls on the beach,'' he explained. But he eventually decided to go back to a regular job. `` After a while, I got tired of never having enough money and never having an ID,'' he said. As for the pretty girls, `` Unfortunately, about the time you get to know them, they've gone back to <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>, -LRB- Ind. -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said. He got <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>'s name and Social Security number by placing a newspaper ad for an engineering job that the man answered. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents who caught him lost interest in the case after discovering he was not a drug dealer or money launderer. `` The federal charge that he was investigated on was possession of a false Social Security card number,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>, who handled the case in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Under an agreement with the government, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> must stay out of trouble for a year or face charges in the case. He also faces $ 78,000 in back taxes. And he must face the past. `` Anyone with any attachment to the human race could n't do what he did,'' said his ex-wife, <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who divorced him after he disappeared. `` I will never forgive him for what he did to the boys.'' She said she told him he could contact his sons, now 9 and 16, if he wanted, however. As for why he left, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said, `` I felt trapped. I really hated management. ... I did n't like my life.'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> plans to remain at his job in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.

 About three dozen pay-raise protesters gathered at Union Station this morning to greet <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats as they departed by train for a weekend legislative retreat at a luxurious <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> resort. `` Money for the needy, not for the greedy,'' the group chanted. However, the lawmakers arrived by bus under police guard and slipped in through a side door of the station to avoid the protesters. Groups represented ranged from the conservative Students for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to followers of <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, an advocate for the homeless. `` Maybe we would be less inclined to be here if they were rushing through a rise in the minimum wage'' or other measures to help low-income Americans, <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said.

The annual retreat is subsidized by corporate and union interests. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 95-5 Thursday to reject the 51 percent pay raise recommended by a presidential commission, placing the spotlight on a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership plan to legalize the increase next week but scale it back to 30 percent a day later. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution included language to roll back the raise if it becomes law and end the system allowing congressional increases, along with those for top federal executives and judges, to become law automatically unless rejected by both houses. Rank-and-file lawmakers would see their salaries rise from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000 under the full raise. But the pay would be $ 116,350 under <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s plan.

 The Chinese government has invited Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, setting the stage for the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement today that Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> proposed the visit in talks with his visiting Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who `` accepted the invitation and expressed his gratitude.'' Soviet Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Viatcheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit could come as early as April. Senior Chinese leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> will set the date when he meets with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> on Saturday in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> today after meeting for nearly two hours with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. The Soviet embassy said only that the summit date and bilateral and international issues were discussed. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would be the first Soviet leader to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> met <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1959. A year later, relations between the countries deteriorated over ideological and strategic differences, and the Soviets halted technical and military aid to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 30 years, arrived Wednesday for a three-day trip to work out final details for the summit. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> said during the talks that `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should establish a new type of state relationship with each other'' based on principles of equality and peaceful coexistence, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> `` stressed that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and that the normalization of the relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should not prejudice their respective relations with other countries,'' the ministry statement said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> repeatedly has said it will never return to its relationship of the 1950s when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was new Communist state's political mentor and main economic benefactor. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> also has assured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations with which it enjoys increasingly important economic and strategic ties that there is no possibility of a future Sino-Soviet alliance. Earlier today, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> canceled a tour of the Forbidden Palace amid speculation he might meet Cambodian resistance leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, who now resides in the Chinese capital. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> long has insisted that Soviet financial backing for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 10-year occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is the major obstacle to normalizing Sino-Soviet relations. Qian, in a banquet speech Thursday night, said the two sides had reached a consensus `` on many aspects of the problem,'' including the need for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to pull out its troops and for some kind of international supervision after Vietnamese troops leave. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is the main backer for the three-party resistance coalition battling the Vietnamese in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. It supports the introduction of an international peacekeeping force after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s departure, an idea <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has rejected. In his banquet speech, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> called for joint ventures, cooperation in science and technology and the transformation of the Sino-Soviet border into a region of `` peace, friendship and good-neighborly cooperation.'' The two countries fought a short border war in 1969. Economic and cultural contacts gradually have increased in the 1980s, but normalization of political and party relations has been stalled by the issues of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the Soviet incursion into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the highly militarized border. Relations have improved rapidly in the past year following Soviet announcements it is withdrawing from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and reducing its troop strength in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, and with progress in efforts to end the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has reversed its policy of refusing to borrow from foreign banks as another step toward rebuilding an economy devastated after eight years of war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Families of four aborigines who died in police custody today denounced a government report on the deaths that criticized police but stopped short of recommending criminal charges. The report, issued Thursday, found no evidence of foul play in the four deaths but said they probably could have been avoided. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON> was ordered by the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> in 1987 to investigate 44 aboriginal deaths nationwide since 1980. Since the inquiry began, the number of deaths has jumped to 107. Most of the offenders were arrested on minor charges such as being drunk and disorderly. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, whose son, <PERSON> Kingsley </PERSON>, was found hanging in his cell in <LOCATION> Adelaide </LOCATION> jail in 1987, wept when she heard the report. `` I expected some retribution. They're murdering our people, our boys, and they're getting away with it,'' she said. `` My son is dead, other sons are dead and other mothers are grieving and this is the result we are going to get.'' <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, whose 21-year-old son <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> was found hanged in 1981, said: `` I've never believed police.'' She said the finding her son took his own life `` shatters my faith in white justice.'' <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON> said police fabricated evidence and withheld evidence during the inquiry's investigation of <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>'s death. The judge concluded that proper custodial care and observance of prison regulations could have prevented <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s death, and that the death by heart attack of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, 31, in 1984 might have been avoided. <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON> said the fourth death, that of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Highfold </PERSON>, 37, at <LOCATION> Adelaide </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in 1983 was from natural causes. <PERSON> Muirhead </PERSON> did n't say when another report on more deaths would be released. The National Aboriginal and <ORGANIZATION> Islander </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which helped pressure the government to investigate, criticized the inquiry. `` There is no message in there that says to police, ` Stop if you are killing people or if you all allowing aboriginals to die,''' said service director <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s indigenous aborigines number about 160,000, or about 1 percent of the 16 million population.

 Protestant and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> politicians in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> confirmed today that party members met secretly in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> but said they found no way to end the province's sectarian violence. `` Sadly, there's no agreement, there's no new dawn, there's no new era. We are not on the eve of a breakthrough,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, deputy leader of the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. His assessment differed from that of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which said the talks last year produced unanimous agreement on power sharing at all levels of government, including the police, in the British-ruled province. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said the secret four-party talks could produce the most important political breakthrough since sectarian violence in the Protestant-dominated province flared in 1969. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> participated in the talks. Meetings have continued in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> since October, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said the West German talks included representatives of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s two main Protestant parties, the largest Roman Catholic party and the middle-of-the-road <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It said they took place Oct. 14-15 at the Angerhof Hotel between <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> and Duisburg. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the legal political wing of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was not included, the report said. The mostly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the 60 percent <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. About 2,700 people have been killed in sectarian violence since 1969. Reacting to the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> report, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, who leads the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s version of what had happened was `` wildly exaggerated'' and `` completely off the wall.'' <PERSON> Hume </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> radio interview today that the political leaders were invited to a meeting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to put forward their views on <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. He said there had been previous similar meetings in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and others in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> that brought together <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> politicians from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` But we did not exaggerate and say that suddenly there's a great breakthrough because there has not been ... I am not aware the four parties reached agreement.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday night it was `` crackers'' to suggest his or the Rev. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s Democratic Unionists had been involved in any formal talks. He said the meeting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was merely the kind of conference frequently attended by senior <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> leaders. `` There has never been any negotiation about the future government of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>, deputy leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which draws support from both Catholics and Protestants, said a German Lutheran churchmen organized the West German meeting for a different purpose, which he did not specify, and the talks about political differences took place `` somewhat by accident.'' `` There was a regular line of communication opened between the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> political parties and ... great willingness to look at the problems of the other community,'' he said. In addition to <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said, the other two politicians who worked out the agreement in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, chairman of the Official Unionists, the largest Protestant party; and <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> of <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>'s party, the largest <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> political group. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Protestant party leaders who were not at the talks divorced themselves from the report. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> said the talks were supported by the government of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the neighboring <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to direct the federal war on drugs, said today he has `` the confidence of the president'' and will be able to handle the job despite not being a member of the Cabinet. In an interview this morning, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he appreciated the concern of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and others who have criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to leave him out of the Cabinet. On Thursday, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said, `` I'm worried that the president has made a crucial mistake, maybe in part by oversight, by not having the drug coordinator at the table.'' The director of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> `` has to do what none of the others -LRB- in the Cabinet -RRB- has to do,'' said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>. `` He has to take them on, as a practical matter. He is entering the most dangerous world in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and that is the world of fiefdoms.'' The director will be called upon to develop a strategy covering more than 30 agencies spread throughout the federal government that are under the more direct control of individual department secretaries. `` I have the confidence of the president,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` I know that. He said it. I heard it. He said it to my colleagues.'' In a preliminary meeting of the top Cabinet-level appointments, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told everyone that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> would be in charge of drug control programs and said, `` You are to work with him,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> recalled. `` He has since reiterated that,'' he said. `` He's told me, ` I want you to be able to do it -LRB- the new job -RRB- in a way that's unencumbered'. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he's been assured by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he will be invited to Cabinet meetings when they pertain to the drug effort. Asked if he felt he wasted a lot of time attending Cabinet meetings on subjects he did n't care about during his 3 -LCB- years as education secretary under President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said only, `` I went to three years of Cabinet meetings, and some were more interesting than others.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> last week, planned to make courtesy calls this afternoon with Sens. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that will begin hearings on his nomination starting March 1 <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said Thursday that he had wanted to start the hearings a month earlier, but agreed to the later date at the administration's request to give <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> time to prepare Once <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is confirmed, he `` must begin work immediately on developing a plan that has never been developed in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, and that is a comprehensive drug plan,'' which is due 180 days after the nominee is confirmed, said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del. `` The clock is running the day I'm confirmed,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said today. `` Senator <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and I discussed this and we decided to put off the hearings a bit to give us time to set up our staff, figure out how the office is going to run.'' He said his vow to quit smoking by the time he was confirmed was not the reason for the delay in the hearings. `` I will be done by the time I take office,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` I've set a date for that, but I'm not going to preach until I've succeeded. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> noted that the job of director of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> is bound to be extremely difficult. `` Dr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> or whoever will take that post will be a sitting duck. There is no way someone can succeed in the first year,'' he said. The senator said he considered the administration's request for a delay until March 1 `` reasonable.'' `` We have created a completely new Cabinet post, and this is an infrequent occurrence which requires time and great effort to implement,'' he said. `` Dr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has no office, no place to reside, physically, and he has no staff.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has other obligations to take care of before he starts his new job. Those include some speaking engagements and completion of a book on education.

 A British-born woman who escaped from black nationalist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> had been a South African police spy since 1981, police headquarters said today. <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, 28, spent six months holed up in the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, last year after she escaped from <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who had held her under guard for 22 months. She was allowed to leave <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> in November, flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and then returned to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Until today, neither she nor South African police would comment on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s allegation that she was a spy who had infiltrated the guerrilla movement. Her father, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, had insisted she was a journalist. The head of the police security branch, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Basie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smit </PERSON>, said in a statement that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> was a police lieutenant who gathered `` valuable information'' after pretending to defect to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Smit </PERSON> said she was tortured at an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> camp in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smit </PERSON> also disclosed the identity of another police spy, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnden </PERSON>, who infiltrated prominent anti-apartheid organizations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> such as the Black Sash civil rights group and the End Consription Campaign. Both women `` performed a great duty for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ... in exceptionally dangerous circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Smit </PERSON>. He said details of their assignments were being disclosed to counter a `` twisted account'' that might come from the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. Police also issued a statement from <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, who holds British and South African citizenship. In the statement, she asserted that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was wracked by ethnic conflict, disillusionment and alcoholism. She said the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s exiled leadership did not want <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> released from prison in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because they felt he was more useful to them as a martyr. She also said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, was an `` embarassment'' to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> was outlawed by the South African government in 1960 and bagen a bombing and sabotage campaign in 1961 aimed at undermining the white-minority government. Miss <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> said she tried to convince the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> that she was a defector from the South African security forces and made a pre-planned confession containing both factual and false information. While the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> investigated her claims, she said, she was held under `` diabolical'' conditions at the guerrilla movement's Quatro rehabilitation camp in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. She later was taken to a house in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> and escaped from it in May when her guards became drunk, she said. Miss <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> said her first spying mission came in 1982, when she was assigned by police to infiltrate anti-apartheid student organizations at <ORGANIZATION> Rhodes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, in the eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Grahamstown </LOCATION>. A reporter for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> newspaper group interviewed Miss <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> prior to the release of the police statement, and quoted her account of being a campus spy. `` I had to adopt a radical left-wing lifestyle in every respect, from dress, language and manners to living in left-wing communes,'' she was quoted as saying. `` My parents at this stage knew nothing of my real role and they were extremely disappointed.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has announced that it will permanently close three of its four city high schools in June because of a decade-long decrease in enrollment
</TEXT>

 The archdiocese announced Thursday that it will close <ORGANIZATION> Mackin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, a boys school, and <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saints </ORGANIZATION> and Holy Spirit, two girls high schools. Only Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> High School will open for classes in the fall, drawing students from the other three schools and for the first time admittng girls as students. Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s archbishop, said the archdiocese was not abandoning the nation's capital. `` Our committment remains unshaken and enhanced,'' he said. Meanwhile, two independent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> girls high schools in the area also have announced plans to close. They are the Academy of Notre Dame, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Regina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Hyattsville </LOCATION>, Md. The closings follow a nationwide trend among Catholic schools caused by the continuing exodus of middle-class black families from the inner city to the suburbs. About 1,300 students will be affected by the closings. On Thursday, the students grappled with the news that their schools were closing. `` We're <PERSON> Mackin </PERSON> men and that means something,'' said <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mackin </PERSON> student body president. `` It is unfair for the cardinal to just close us down.

<HEAD>County Declines Offer of Abandoned, Unheated Tower as Homeless Shelter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HALL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government has offered to lease an abandoned 80-foot observation tower to house homeless people in a rural county, but perplexed local officials say they do n't need it. `` If we had any homeless, we certainly would n't take them down there and put them in an 80-foot tower, not if we had their best interests at heart,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> commission president <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasin </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. `` Why would you want to stick them in the middle of the boonies?'' he asked. The 1940s-era steel tower is a former observation platform that was used by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground north of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to monitor shelling across the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Access to the top is up a formidable number of rickety wooden stairs. It lacks heat, electricity or running water, and is located along the waterfront in a hard-to-find corner of the rural county. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> recently notified <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials that they could lease the abandoned tower to house the homeless if they were interested. They were n't.

<TEXT>
 About 200 people fought police with firebombs in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> today during a demonstration demanding an thorough investigation into the government's suppression of a 1980 uprising in the southern city. A police officer was beaten by protesters and taken to a hospital, but his condition was not immediately known, the <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. The protesters were among about 1,000 people who marched through downtown after an outdoor rally denouncing the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the news agency said. About 200 people, mostly students, dashed from the crowd hurling rocks and dozens of firebombs when about 800 police halted the march 50 yards from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center, <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the marchers dispersed voluntarily a short time later. The authoritarian government killed about 200 people when it put down an uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> in 1980. The protesters accused the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government of blocking efforts to investigate the suppression of the revolt. Opposition and dissident figures say some military leaders instigated the uprising as part of a plot to seize power in the chaotic days that followed the death of then-President Park Chung-hee in late 1979. They say the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acquiesced in a military plan to suppress the revolt ruthlessly and therefore is partly to blame for the deaths. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has denied the charges and said it will cooperate with a parliamentary committee investigating the revolt. Parliamentary officials said today that next week they will send a questionnaire to two Americans, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleysteen </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON>, and ask them to clarify any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in the case. <PERSON> Gleysteen </PERSON> was the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> served as the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military commander at the time of the uprising.

 Freezing drizzle ushered the Big Chill of'89 deeper into the nation's midsection and toward the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> today, turning highways into glaring stretches of ice and draping trees and power lines in a hardened coat. The frigid air mass that spilled into the lower 48 states from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> earlier in the week brought more snow today to the weather-weary <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and northern states, threatening crops and endangering newborn livestock. Many cities stepped up aid to the homeless. At <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, hundreds of people were left without heat when a 4-inch natural gas pipeline ruptured. Temperatures were in the single digits at <LOCATION> Paducah </LOCATION> and residents were told to move to electrically heated buildings. The cold spell has closed schools, disrupted travel, and caused power outages at a time when electricity is in high demand. Wind-chill readings between 60 and 80 degrees below zero were common across much of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. Stretching across a roughly triangular area from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the air mass is pushing southward, but at a slower pace than earlier in the week, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's moving quite a bit slower now. We're not getting the really rapid changes in temperatures that we were,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said today. Overnight lows today were below zero all the way south to the middle <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, with readings between 20 below zero and 38 below zero over the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, much of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, the weather service said. <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, fell from a high Thursday of 69 to a low today of 28, and a freeze warning was posted tonight for the lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Record lows were scattered from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, including 33 below zero at <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont </LOCATION>. The below-normal temperatures are expected to linger until the middle of next week. Schools in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and elsewhere told students to stay home today because of the snow and cold. `` There's no sense messing with this stuff,'' said <LOCATION> Oswego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, school Superintendent <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sink </PERSON>, who closed his schools. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> state government employees returned to work today after being sent home because of the weather at midday Thursday by Gov. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. The capital, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>, also had to cope with a train explosion that forced the daylong evacuation of thousands of people and left some without power with 38 below zero temperatures. The cold chased out what had been an unusually warm January in many parts of the country. Bostonians enjoyed a record-high 66 degrees Wednesday. Twenty-four hours later, the city shivered in 31 degrees and freezing rain. At the same time as northern states experienced staggering lows on Thursday, the southeast corner of the nation was hitting record highs. Nearly 30 records were set, including 80 degrees in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, 80; and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, 80. Two school buses collided on an icy school parking lot today in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and 16 students suffered minor injuries, authorities said. At least seven traffic fatalities were blamed on the weather, which slickened highways in a band of freezing rain from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Edmonds </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a utility worker died Thursday when he fell while trying to repair a downed power line. Two men died of exposure, one in <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, and the other in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>. And in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, four sledding deaths were reported. But a life was saved in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> when searchers Thursday found a 16-year-old boy who got stranded three days before while driving to his family's farm. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> of rural <PERSON> Egeland </PERSON> had only a stocking cap, light jacket, sweatshirt and car mats to keep him warm. `` He's quite a courageous young man,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Norberg </PERSON> at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luke </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Stebleton </PERSON> was taken with frostbitten feet and hands. Overnight temperatures in the area had plunged to 30 degrees below zero. The Alaskan air mass also delivered a rare snowfall to parts of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` There was snow right down to the beach in <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, deputy city clerk at the tiny fishing town 300 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said late Thursday. `` It was nice; the kids loved it.'' Farmers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state worried that the cold would damage their fruit trees. Some growers in the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> activated wind machines in orchards, said extension agent <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Willett </PERSON>. The machines are designed to draw warmer air from 50 to 100 feet above the ground down into orchards, he said. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> ranchers said cattle were giving birth to calves that died from exposure within hours. One rancher, Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingham </PERSON>, said he lost two calves. `` We had one up and nursing, and came back and that big 100-pounder was dead,'' <PERSON> Ingham </PERSON> said. `` It's the wind chill out on this prairie.'' Sheep ranchers in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> were worried about newborn lambs. `` You've got to stay right on them or they'll freeze as soon as they hit the ground,'' said rancher <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> McBeth </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> used heavy water purchased from the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> in its nuclear weapons program despite assurances it would n't do so, a nuclear expert said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exploded a nuclear weapon in 1974. Soon after, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which had supplied both nuclear technology and heavy water to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, cut off shipments. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> then turned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for its heavy water. The <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION>, in nearby <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, at one time sold heavy water to 21 countries, including eight with nuclear weapons programs. Those countries were <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, according to records cited by The <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Augusta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have exploded nuclear weapons; <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> either have or are capable of producing such weapons; and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> are close, said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Spector </PERSON>, senior associate with the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> received 36 tons of heavy water in seven sales made in 1954, 1959 and 1960. It returned 15 tons of the water, records show. The heavy water `` was sold to a facility that was not under inspection, but <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> promised it was not being used to produce nuclear weapons,'' <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said. `` It looked like a clear violation.'' <PERSON> Spector </PERSON> said most of the heavy water used by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in producing its bomb was from other countries, `` but American heavy water had been involved.'' Heavy water is used as a moderator or primary coolant in some nuclear reactors, including those at <ORGANIZATION> SRP </ORGANIZATION>. The Atomic Energy Act and its amendments allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> sell heavy water to foreign countries as part of a program to expand the peaceful use of nuclear power as an alternative energy source. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Sankey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the department made the sales with the guidance of the administrations and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A state department spokesman said Thursday the department could not comment but would review the report. A spokesman for the Indian embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who declined to give his name, contended today that the 1974 explosion was not a nuclear weapon. `` It was an underground explosion, called a ... peaceful nuclear explosion,'' he said. `` It was not weapon-oriented; it was scientific research ... for harnessing atomic energy.''

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, playing host to its first big international gathering, got a skeptical reception today from allied finance ministers over the ability of the president's `` flexible freeze'' plan to reduce the federal budget deficit, participants said Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was holding two days of closed-door discussions with his foreign counterparts. The sessions began late Thursday and continued through dinner. Finance ministers and central bank presidents from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> rushed from their limousines into the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> building today without speaking to reporters kept across the street by police. But French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> told reporters at a breakfast meeting that <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> had given the group assurances that the administration was committed to reducing the budget deficit and would meet the $ 100 billion deficit limit for the upcoming fiscal year required by the Gramm-Rudman law. The deficit for fiscal 1989, which ends Sept. 30, is expected to top $ 160 billion. <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> stressed that the administration saw the reduction of the deficit as a `` very important'' commitment. However, a senior Canadian official said the other finance ministers displayed much skepticism about the chances of success of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` flexible freeze,'' his campaign proposal to bring down the deficit without new taxes by simply holding overall spending growth to the level of inflation. The Canadian official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, said other finance ministers expressed doubt to the Americans that the proposal could work because it was based on extremely optimistic economic assumptions, involving steep declines in interest rates. The official said there was also discussion at Thursday's dinner meeting by the so-called Group of Seven over the problem of Third World debt and the need for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to do more to reduce their huge trade surpluses. <PERSON> Beregevoy </PERSON> said <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> hoped the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the other countries would be willing to set up new machinery to guarantee interest paymnents on the debt, using money supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. But he said he was willing to listen to other suggestions. While officials agree that there is a pressing need to do something to relieve the growing debt burden of developing countries, no final decision is expected to come out of this meeting. The countries are expected to carry on talks at a lower level, hoping to come up with concrete proposals to consider at the March 31-April 4 meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> talks, coming only two weeks after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration, mark the first time <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s major trading partners are getting a chance to discuss international policy issues with the new administration The talks were coming during a period of relative calm for global currency markets, but investors were still watching with keen interest, hoping to learn more about the new administration's views on international economic matters. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was criticized last November for botching an effort to calm financial markets concerned about a steep drop in the value of the dollar. During a television interview, he said: `` Markets go up and down. ... I do n't really worry about -LRB- the dollar's decline -RRB- very much.'' The dollar plunged further following <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s comments. The greenback has since stabilized, however, as the administration has repeatedly declared that it is serious about attacking the huge federal budget deficits. There has been growing pressure from other countries to move away from the approach to Third World debt first advanced by then-Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. It proposed new loans but no reduction of debt burdens for 15 of the largest debtor countries. Many industrial countries and debtor nations believe the time has come to grant debt relief. In his inaugural speech Thursday, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, called for a summit meeting between debtor nations and the industrial countries to search for a way of `` breaking the vicious circle of debt and stagnation.'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said the world needs to abandon the case-by-case approach that is supported by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, saying this has not been in the best interests of Latin American debtors. `` Each country found itself alone facing a formidable cartel of creditors whose schemes and interests prevailed,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has promised a new look at the debt problem but has revealed no specifics about what the new administration might favor. Representatives of Latin American governments who are the biggest debtors were meeting today in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. They were expected to propose a new international body to buy up some of the debt at discounts from the face note on the loans.

<TEXT>
 Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> leaders have rejected a plan to give black Anglicans more seats on the main policy-making body of the church. After a two-hour debate, lay members of the Anglican state church on Thursday blocked the proposal by a 96-80 vote, despite favorable votes of 17-3 by bishops and 103-62 by clergy. The plan needed a majority of each group to pass, as well as approval by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Barbados-born Bishop of <PERSON> Croydon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, the first black bishop of the state church to serve in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, left <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Westminster </LOCATION> immediately after the vote. He looked upset and declined comment. Although <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerns </ORGANIZATION> proposed the plan, he and the seven other black members of the General <PERSON> Synod </PERSON> did not speak during the body's debate. The proposal would have set aside a minimum of 24 seats for blacks on the 574-member, policy-making synod in 1990. Proponents said the arrangement would better reflect the estimated 2 million blacks among <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s 49 million people. <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> have separate churches. During the debate, senior synod member <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said legal advice had shown <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> would reject the plan as `` inexpedient.'' Businessman <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Royle </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> had never reserved seats for any particular party or race. `` We wo n't make restitution for our past to those who come from abroad, particularly from the former colonies, by giving one group a special role,'' he said. Archbishop of York <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Habgood </PERSON> urged the synod to approve the plan and negotiate with the government on what it would accept. `` One generation of black people has already been lost and unless we do something now, we shall lose the next generation and the generation after that,'' <PERSON> Habgood </PERSON> said. Several speakers said they saw the plan as offensive to black people because it implied they were incapable of helping themselves.

 Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> relied on a canny blend of military force, political patronage, and self-discipline to maintain control over <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> for 34 years _ longer than any leader in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. But a rebellion by army Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s second-in-command, today ended the dictatorship that began when <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> seized power in a 1954 military coup <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 76, won eight presidential elections despite opposition charges the balloting was rigged. Even his critics admit he helped stabilize a nation that before him had endured 22 presidents in 31 years. But at the same time, he was accused of brutal repression and corruption, and his country became a haven for fugitive Nazis, drug traffickers and former dictators. The list of refugees included <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp doctor, and Gen. <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Debayle </PERSON>, the ousted Nicaraguan dictator. The red-haired <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, son of a Bavarian immigrant father and Paraguayan mother of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> heritage, oversaw the country's transformation from a neglected backwater, with open sewers and no running water, to a relatively prosperous and modern nation Scores of schools and buildings, in addition to <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>'s international airport, were named for the man who began his military career at age 20 and quickly distinguished himself on the battle field In a central plaza in the capital, a huge neon sign blinked incessantly with the slogan, `` Stroessner: Peace, Work and Well-being.'' An important city is named <PERSON> Puerto </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. In his innumberable speeches, which sometimes lasted hours, he liked to list in detail the public works projects achieved by his regime. Among the most important works was the $ 16 billion Itaipu dam, the world's largest hydroelectrical project, built in partnership with neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. It began producing power in early 1985. He attended hundreds of ground-breakings and other public ceremonies each year, even in outlying towns, and served regularly as a witness at weddings _ even when he did n't know the bride or groom. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> credited his longevity and energy to Spartan habits _ he did not smoke and drank little _ and a busy work schedule. Public dissatisfaction with the government became increasingly evident in the mid-1980s, when protesters and police clashed in street demonstrations. The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and even a faction of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> began criticizing the president, accusing him of unjust repression and demanding democratic reforms. Human rights groups said many of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s foes were tortured and killed during his early years in power. Others were simply jailed indefinitely, convicted of political crimes or forced into exile. A rabid anti-communist and staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was stung by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's labeling him as a dictatorship, and relations between the countries declined. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> attended the nation's military academy, graduating in 1929, and as a 20-year-old lieutenant led a mortar platoon in the Chaco War against <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. He distinguished himself for bravery in the war, which lasted from 1932 to 1935, and rose quickly through the ranks, being promoted to general at age 40. He became army chief of staff in 1951. After taking power, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> put down five attempted coups by exiled politicians from 1954 to 1958 and began dismantling the opposition. Employing special powers under a state of siege, renewed each 90 days until last year, civilian and military police arrested thousands of opponents. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> branded virtually all his opponents as subversives. Critics charge his government promoted a growing private sector dominated by contraband. Many government and military officials, including relatives and close assocites, became enriched through their ties with <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> reportedly has been ill since a prostate operation five months ago. His apparent slow recovery increased the demands by opposition leaders that the army and <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> consider a transition to democratic rule.

 A federal judge today awarded $ 1 million in attorneys fees to a <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official and others who had been accused in a civil lawsuit of mounting a guns-for-drugs scheme to aid the Nicaraguan rebels. Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> in June threw out the $ 24 million lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of journalists <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>. The judge said the plaintiffs failed to prove their case, and defense attorneys immediately filed a motion seeking to recover damages caused by the lawsuit. Today the judge ruled again in their favor, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the plaintiffs would have to pay the defendants $ 955,000 in attorneys fees and $ 79,500 in court costs. The judge said the lawsuit was `` based on unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from unidentified sources with no first-hand knowledge.'' Among the defendants the plaintiffs accused of mounting the extensive illegal operation were <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> deputy director of operations <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, Iran-Contra figures <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, and former Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> said he was elated by the decision. The liberal, Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which has appealed King's original decision to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, had no immediate reaction to today's ruling. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and Honey filed the lawsuit in May 1986, prior to many of the revelations in the Iran-Contra affair. It grew from a 1984 bombing in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> apparently aimed at maverick Contra leader <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> escaped, but <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> was injured and several other people were killed. The lawsuit accused the defendants of setting up the bombing, as well as working with drug traffickers in a 30-year conspiracy that covered activities in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other locations.

<TEXT>
 A huge column of Soviet tanks and trucks rumbled out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> early today, and Soviet and Afghan sources said the departure left only about 1,500 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers in the country. The convoy rolled out of the marshaling yard at the base of the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> under cover of darkness and began the 260-mile journey north to the Soviet border in a heavy snowstorm. Afghan soldiers manned the Soviet outposts along the highway and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> flags were replaced with the red, green and black flags of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The U.S.-backed guerrillas, called mujahedeen, have pounded departing Soviet convoys with artillery fire in recent days. The Afghan and Soviet sources said that no more than 1,500 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers would remain in the country once the convoy reached Soviet soil. They said they did not know how many vehicles or soldiers were in the convoy, which took three hours to move out. Early this week, Western and Soviet diplomats said about 15,000 Soviet soldiers were still in the country. The Afghan and Soviet sources said the small contingent that remained in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> today will guard the city's airport during an airlift that will continue for at least a week. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which once had about 100,000 troops in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is to complete its withdrawal by Feb. 15 under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord signed last year. On Thursday, President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said his army was `` mightier than ever'' and ready for battle with the guerrillas, who predict an easy time overthrowing the government once the Soviet pullout is completed. The Afghan army `` can defend the country against any onslaught, and we will prove it,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said at a two-hour news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, in a room unheated because of the fuel shortage in the capital. As he spoke, another Soviet convoy of about 100 trucks, armored vehicles and tanks headed for the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, border headquarters of a seven-party insurgent alliance, a guerrilla leader predicted <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s regime `` will fall in weeks, not months.'' <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, head of the guerrilla group <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference that the insurgents would not have to attack the cities. Speaking of a possible political settlement with the rebels, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> said his <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must be part of any future government. `` Any attempt to exclude'' the party `` and its allies from a coalition goverment will be in vain,'' he said. The guerrillas have rejected offers of settlements based on that assumption and say they are forming a council to choose an Islamic government. Explosions and artillery fire could be heard in and around the capital Thursday, where insurgent attacks have created severe food and fuel shortages. Mountain guerrilla camps surround <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, and insurgent commander <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Masoud </PERSON> controls the <LOCATION> Panjshir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, through which the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> runs. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the neighboring nations in which more than 5 million Afghan refugees live, urged the squabbling guerrilla factions Thursday to patch up their differences and form a broad-based government in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> as soon as the Soviets are gone. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, asked whether he would be willing to resign as part of a settlement, said: `` The resignation of a person will not help to solve any problem.'' He expressed optimism that <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister, would work out a settlement at a meeting with Pakistani leaders Saturday, but added that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> must change its position. `` <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has not only refused to adhere to its commitment under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreements, but it has quantitatively and qualitatively intensified and expanded its armed interferences and aggressions,'' he said. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s assurances about the ability of his conscript army, estimated to number about 140,000, contrasted with uncertainty on the part of others. Several governments, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are closing their embassies and evacuating the staffs because of concern about what will happen when the Soviets are gone. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> joined the growing list Thursday.

<HEAD>Government Can Fine Up To $20,000 For Tampering With Railroad Safety
Devices</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government can fine railroads or individuals up to $ 20,000 for tampering with locomotive safety devices under new rules issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators found that the intentional disabling of a safety warning device contributed to the collision of an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> passenger train and a <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> locomotive, killing 16 people at <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, two years ago. Since then, government inspectors have found more than 70 locomotives with warning whistles, automatic stopping devices and other safety systems intentionally diconnected. Many of the 25,000 locomotives operated by the nation's railroads are equipped with one or more of the devices designed to either record data on the engine's operation or to make it safer, the administration said in issuing the final rules Thursday. The devices range from audible alerts on changing conditions along the rails, such as speed limits, to devices that stop or slow the train if the engineer fails to respond. Under the new rules, fines include $ 2,500 for knowingly operating or permitting the operation of a locomotive with disabled equipment and $ 7,500 for tampering with the equipment. The administration also has the right to increase the fines to as high as $ 20,000 per violation when it finds gross negligence or a pattern of violations which cause death or injury or create an `` imminent hazard.'' The Amtrak-Conrail crash on Jan. 4, 1987, was blamed on gross and willful negligence by the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> crew. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> engineer <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> pleaded guilty to manslaughter and is serving a five-year prison term. He admitted the crew had used marijuana before the accident and violated a number of safety procedures. <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> last July agreed to pay $ 58 million to survivors of those killed and <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> agreed in August to pay $ 8.2 million. The railroads also agreed to create a $ 9 million fund to pay 330 passengers who filed claims for injuries or distress suffered in the collision.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> toured an AIDS pediatric ward at a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> hospital today, asking questions about the dimensions of the problem and winning praise for her interest and involvement. Hundreds of excited <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> workers craned their necks for a glimpse of the 27-year-old princess. There were cheers, applause and shouts of `` Welcome to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, dressed in a double-breasted red suit and white silk blouse, shook hands with some in the crowd and then used the stairs to get to the second floor of <ORGANIZATION> Harlem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> because the elevator bank was blocked by well-wishers. The princess, described on Thursday night as tired and perhaps a little homesick, planned to head home to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> today. Before touring the children's AIDS ward, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> attended a 10-minute briefing given by Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Heagarty </PERSON>, director of pediatrics, Dr. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, head of the pediatrics AIDS unit and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Grates </PERSON>, nursing director. During the session, the princess listened as <PERSON> Heagarty </PERSON> spoke about how 1,300 children have been infected with AIDS nationwide to date. <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> is treating about 100 children with the deadly disease. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> occasionally interrupted asking questions about whether the situation would get worse, the outlook for the next five years and `` when you have the problem of drugs, how do you deal with AIDS as well?'' <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> Thursday night went to the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> for the American debut of the <ORGANIZATION> Welsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>, after which she returned to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> and dazzled guests at a gala dinner in her honor at the World Financial Center. Earlier, she visited a family's apartment at a Lower East Side shelter for the homeless and browsed at the giant <ORGANIZATION> FAO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schwarz </ORGANIZATION> toy store. `` I dreamed about this last night,'' said <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, who shook <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s hand. `` It was better -LRB- than the dream -RRB-. It was really better. We can hold our head up high and say, ` Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> came to the Lower East Side.''' Cheering crowds turned out at each stop to glimpse the princess. The lone note of dissent was heard outside the opera performance, where more than 400 protesters chanted `` <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'' and waved signs denouncing the princess. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, a potential mayoral candidate who is active in <LOCATION> Irish-American </LOCATION> affairs, said the protest `` is not directed against Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, it's directed against her as a symbol of British government, which for much too long has inhabited <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> were heckled as they entered the elegant concert hall, located in a run-down <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> neighborhood. But all was calm and serene inside, where the princess watched a performance of <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` Falstaff,'' which tells the story of Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Falstaff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s knight of the paunch. `` She was very proud of the company,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>, who sat next to the princess during the opera and at the dinner that followed. As Princess of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, she is the patron of the company. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> sat in a balcony box festooned with garlands of purple and red satin. As she entered, the orchestra sounded a drum roll and played, `` God Save the Queen,'' the `` Star Spangled Banner'' and `` Land of My Fathers,'' the Welsh national anthem. From the stage, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> told her: `` I want to bid you welcome. The city is graced by your presence. We want to be sure your visit goes just the way you want it to be so that when you go home you can say you had a royal <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> welcome.'' Although tickets for the performance of `` Falstaff'' and the dinner afterward went for $ 1,000, opera-lovers and fans of the princess who were on a tighter budget could attend the show alone for as little as $ 40. `` I wanted to see the princess. I bought my ticket two days ago,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, a secretary who lives in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. `` She has a very nice quiet air about her, not ostentatious, very royal.'' After the three-hour-plus opera, the princess returned to <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> by limousine to the gala dinner in the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s Winter Garden, where guests were seated at candlelit tables covered in deep red linen cloths. Potted palms rose majestically into the towering canopied space, which <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> entered by sweeping down a sparkling marble staircase, dressed in a white evening gown with beaded bolero. The guests were impressed, but <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>, who sat at the head table with the princess, said the strain of her solo tour was beginning to tell. `` I think she was very tired and this has been a rough couple of days for her,'' said <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>. `` She was very hungry. I do n't think she had eaten all day and she was anxious to get back home.

<HEAD>State Study Cites Above Normal Leukemia Rates Around No. 1 Superfund
Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITMAN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 People living near the the nation's No. 1 Superfund toxic waste cleanup site had higher-than-average rates of adult leukemia and of babies born underweight, a state study concluded. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>'s study was released Thursday at a community meeting at a <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON> elementary school, and was quickly criticized by many residents as being incomplete. The 2 -LCB- - year study, which covered residents of the <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> towns of <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mantua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Glassboro </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, found normal or below-normal rates of types of cancer other than adult leukemia among residents within six-tenths of a mile of the defunct <LOCATION> Lipari </LOCATION> landfill `` It's superficial; the data base looks awful,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manganello </PERSON>, an assistant professor at <ORGANIZATION> Gloucester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> who has taught classes in statistics. `` If this is supposed to be a comprehensive study, I'd hate to see one that is n't,'' <PERSON> Manganello </PERSON> said. `` The study should have gone back more years and collected more data.'' The cancer study looked at data from 1980 through 1984, and the infant birth weight studies compared babies born in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, according to today's editions of The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer. `` These findings suggest that the most adverse health effects occurred during the 1970s, when exposures to hazardous substances were probably the heaviest,'' the study concluded. But it stressed that the limited information covered by the study could not prove that the landfill caused the increased leukemia and low-birth-weight rates. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has set aside $ 20 million to clean up the 15-acre landfill 12 miles south of <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, which is ranked at the top of the Superfund priority list of more than 900 toxic-waste sites. The Lipari landfill began operations in 1958, taking wastes from several nearby plants. It was closed by the state in 1971 after residents complained of respiratory problems, nausea, dying vegitation, and odors. Numerous carcinogens such as benzene, methylene chloride and aresnmic have been found at the site. In 1983, the landfill was sealed off by a containing wall and cover made of polyethylene. The next phase of the cleanup involves flushing contaminants from the landfill, a process that could take up to seven years.

 The judge at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial selected four more people as prospective jurors today, including one who said she does n't pay attention to news because it's `` depressing'' and thinks the controversy over <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> is `` boring. The woman, a secretary to a hospital director, said her mother, who lives with her, pays such close attention to current events that `` I call her ` news media'.'' When her mother approaches her about the news, `` I always tell her to get out of my room. I do n't want to hear it,'' said the woman. She acknowledged she had been aware from other people, but said she paid no attention to, <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s immunized congressional testimony in 1987 in which he detailed many of the activities for which he is now accused of crimes. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> qualified her for the jury pool over the objections of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who said the woman `` was bombarded at a minimum'' with references to North. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> also selected a military personnel clerk for the pool, to which 29 people have been sent since the trial opened Tuesday. He hopes to build it to 50 before selecting a jury. Three people were rejected for the pool, including a businesswoman who said <PERSON> North </PERSON> was involved in `` money and arms ... on an international scale.'' She said she knew that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had `` a boss named <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'' and `` he had a blond secretary,'' a reference to <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, who has been granted immunity from prosecution by the government in exchange for her testimony. The businesswoman, who has a masters degree, said she did n't watch the 1987 congressional hearings because she was starting a business and working 14 hours or more a day On Thursday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that `` security gurus'' from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and other intelligence agencies wo n't be permitted to disrupt <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> responded angrily to a request that courtroom seats be reserved for intelligence experts from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and agencies including the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and possibly others. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> agreed to set up four seats for the intelligence community, but said he is `` very concerned about their function.'' `` I do not intend to have this case run by two or three security gurus sitting in the audience,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. `` I do n't want to be in a position where every time a document flashes by you go to these people who check with their department.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s admonition reflects a continuing behind-the-scenes dispute in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. The <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> is worried that government secrets will be disclosed in the courtroom, even though the two central charges against North were dropped Jan. 13 due to national security considerations. The 12 charges that remain generally accuse the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide of attempts to cover up his activities in the Iran-Contra affair _ activities which in many cases have since been made public. The <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> had gone to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> with a list of objections it said warranted blocking the trial, government sources said. The attorney general has the authority to prevent disclosure of sensitive information that might harm national security, but <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> overruled the <ORGANIZATION> NSA </ORGANIZATION> objections. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, in his courtroom remarks Thursday, disclosed that he had turned down an earlier unspecified request from the intelligence community concerning how the trial would be conducted. He did not discuss the ruling, but said: `` I do not want to see that proposal re-established in some other form.'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s comments came at the end of a day in which nine prospective jurors were sent into a jury pool the judge wants to build to 50 before selecting a 12-member jury and six alternates. The judge predicted it will take `` most of next week'' to complete the jury selection process. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has spent much time since the Iran-Contra indictment was handed up last March dealing with the problem of classified information which the prosecution and defense want to present at trial.

<TEXT>
 The general who ousted military dictator <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a coup today is a career soldier who rose from a humble background to become commander of the army's premier unit and a wealthy man Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, the son of a farmer, grew up in the rural town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> but now lives in a mansion in a plush suburb of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. Little is known of his early career, but <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, about 64, was named commander of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in 1961. The corps, one of three, is the largest and best equipped in the army. When <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> attacked police headquarters and the presidential guard to oust <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, he had 40 to 50 tanks at his disposal plus mortars, cannons, recoilless rifles, heavy machine guns and manpower. It was not clear why <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> chose to unseat the 76-year-old <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> or why he acted when he did. But diplomatic and political observers said that shortly before the coup, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a stocky man of medium height, was ordered by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> to retire as army commander and become defense minister. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> refused. Opposition leader <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> speculated that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> acted because he had privately sided with the traditionalist wing of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has called for a transition to a more democratic government and sought to distance itself from <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> were personal friends as well as professional colleagues. Their families became joined when <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Marta </PERSON>, married <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was well known inside the capital, but the first time many Paraguayans heard of him was this morning when he said in his clipped, commanding voice on the radio that <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was under arrest and he was `` taking command of the country from this moment.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who will lead administration anti-drug efforts, said Friday his lack of a permanent seat at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet table will not impair his ability to deal effectively with other top officials. `` I have the confidence of the president,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I know that. He said it. I heard it. He said it to my colleagues.'' In a meeting of top-level appointees, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told everyone that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> would be in charge of drug-control programs and said, `` You are to work with him,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> recalled. `` He has since reiterated that,'' he said. `` He's told me, ` I want you to be able to do it -LRB- the new job -RRB- in a way that's unencumbered.' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also said he's been assured by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he will be invited to Cabinet meetings when they pertain to the anti-drug effort. Several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who will preside over <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s confirmation hearings starting March 1, have criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to leave the `` drug czar'' out of the `` I'm worried that the president has made a crucial mistake, maybe in part by oversight, by not having the drug coordinator at the table,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said Thursday. The director of national drug control policy `` has to do what none of the others -LRB- in the Cabinet -RRB- has to do,'' said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>. `` He has to take them on, as a practical matter. He is entering the most dangerous world in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and that is the world of fiefdoms.'' As soon as <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is confirmed, he will have 180 days to develop a drug control strategy covering more than 30 agencies spread throughout the federal government. Those agencies are under the more direct control of individual department secretaries. `` I appreciate the concern of Senator <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who met with him last week and was making courtesy calls on other members of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday afternoon. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also said he had met with some department heads, such as Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. He said he has not been involved `` except in a very general way'' in developing the budget for fiscal 1990 that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to present Feb. 9. `` We're not going to get really involved in that until we've finished our six-month plan,'' he said The 180-day deadline for development of a drug strategy is the reason his confirmation hearings were delayed until March 1, according to both <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who said he originally had wanted the hearings to begin a month earlier. `` The clock is running the day I'm confirmed,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` Senator <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> and I discussed this and we decided to put off the hearings a bit to give us time to set up our staff, figure out how the office is going to run.'' He said he still has not decided who will be his top two deputies _ one to work on reduction of demand for drugs and the other on cutting the supply. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> vowed the day he was named to the job by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Jan. 12, that he would quit smoking by the time he was confirmed. He said Friday he had n't yet, but `` I will be done by the time I take office. I've set a date for that, but I'm not going to preach until I've succeeded.''

<HEAD>Government Plans to Pardon 30,000 For Hirohito's Funeral</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will pardon about 30,000 people and reinstate certain rights for about 11 million others as part of the funeral for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, news reports said Friday. Chief government spokesman <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said the government would pardon people guilty of 17 minor offenses, including violations of traffic laws and the <ORGANIZATION> Alien </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Registration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, news reports said. The plan also includes reinstating certain rights for about 11 million people, such as the right to vote, to run for public office or to obtain driver's licenses because of past offenses, the reports quoted <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> as saying. The plan is to be approved at a Cabinet meeting next week after Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> returns from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the reports said. Thirty-one foreigners on trial for violating the controversial Alien Registration Law have said they are opposed to pardons because they would eliminate their ability to protest in court against the law's requirement that all resident aliens be fingerprinted and carry identification cards. The amnesty plan excludes people convicted of bribery, and therefore will not apply to former Prime Minister <PERSON> Kakuei </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, who was convicted in 1987 of receiving a bribe of $ 3.9 million from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to facilitate the sale of aircraft to a Japanese airline. The government has pardoned criminals on previous occasions, such as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s admission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1956, the wedding of then Crown Price <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> in 1959 and the return of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1972. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that 133 countries have notified <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> they will send representatives to <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral on Feb. 24. Of the total, 54 nations have said they will send their head of state, a ministry official said. A senior official in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said it plans to mobilize 32,000 police to guard dignitaries and Japanese officials at the funeral. At least six radical groups opposed to the imperial system have threatened to disrupt the funeral.

<HEAD>HHS Offers Abandoned Tower as Shelter For Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HALL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials had no trouble turning down an offer by the federal government to help house the homeless _ the government was offering an old military observation tower as a shelter. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> recently notified county officials that they could lease the abandoned tower for the homeless. It's 80 feet tall, devoid of heat, electricity or running water and situated in a remote part of the county. `` It's ludicrous,'' said county administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>. `` I ca n't believe anybody ever bothered to take a look at the thing.'' The largely rural county has few problems with homeless anyway, officials said. `` If we had any homeless, we certainly would n't take them down there and put them in an 80-foot tower, not if we had their best interests at heart,'' said county commission President <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasin </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the notice to the county may have been an error. `` We've been getting a lot of calls about things like this,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glavin </PERSON>. `` Either properties are too remote or they somehow would n't work.'' A federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ordered <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> to determine which of more than 300 surplus government properties could be used to shelter the homeless under the <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. The ruling resulted from a lawsuit brought by homeless advocates. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials had only a month to determine which surplus sites should be offered and gathered information by sending questionnaires about the properties to other federal agencies. It is unlikely that anyone from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> actually visited the tower or contacted local officials about it until now, <PERSON> Glavin </PERSON> said. The 1940s-era steel tower was used by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as an observation platform during gun tests at <ORGANIZATION> Aberdeen </ORGANIZATION> Proving Ground.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Crew of Crashed B-1B Simply Got Too Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it lost one of its new B-1B bombers in a crash last fall because the pilot and co-pilot lost track of their altitude while attempting an instrument landing. The accident, which occurred Nov. 17 at <ORGANIZATION> Ellsworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, destroyed the $ 280 million plane. The four crewmen ejected safely. The detailed accident report, released by the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, was unusually direct in citing crew error. The bomber's pilot, a highly qualified instructor aircraft commander, `` allowed the aircraft to descend below the published minimum descent altitude for the approach being flown,'' and the plane hit a power line and poles more than a half mile from the runway, the report said. It said the plane's co-pilot failed to advise the pilot he was too low. Lt. Col. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a spokesman for SAC, said Friday no disciplinary action had been taken against the crew. He declined to speculate whether any would be. The aircraft commander was Maj. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skillman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bellmeade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> His co-pilot that night was Capt. <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthals </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alamos </LOCATION>, N.M. Also aboard were Capt. <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> of <PERSON> Aiken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, the offensive system operator, and Maj. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spraggins </PERSON>, an instructor defensive system operator from <LOCATION> Voorheesville </LOCATION>, N.Y. The crash at <LOCATION> Ellsworth </LOCATION> occurred at 10:40 p.m. local time. While the weather conditions were cold and foggy with a low cloud ceiling, another B-1B landed safely just moments before the crash, the report said. It said `` neither aircraft nor engine icing was a contributing factor to the accident,'' and maintenance and other records revealed no other factors leading to the mishap. <LOCATION> Skillman </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Guthals </PERSON> were making their second attempt to land that night, having broken off an earlier approach. On the second try, <LOCATION> Skillman </LOCATION> had leveled the plane off at 3,480 feet _ the minimum altitude specified for that runway and approach _ but then allowed it to drift lower, the report said. After an unidentified crewman called out `` altitude,'' the pilot applied additional power to arrest his descent. The plane `` remained level or in a slight descent for five seconds and then commenced an uninterrupted descent. Seven seconds later, the right wing ... struck and sheared three wooden far field monitor poles,'' the investigators wrote. The crash was the third involving a production-model B-1B in 14 months, leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> with 97 of its original 100 planes. The four-engine, swing-wing B-1B is the first addition to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s manned bomber force in more than 25 years. The plane is designed to fill the gap between the aging fleet of B-52 bombers and the new B-2 stealth bomber. The B-1B, built by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has a maximum speed of about 1,000 mph and a range of more than 7,000 miles.

 Someone used accurate police jargon over a restricted frequency to report an officer had been shot, sparking a hunt involving 24 officers, two helicopters and police dogs, authorities said. The tense, two-hour search ended when a radio roll call determined that no officer was missing, said <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> Division Sgt. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON>. The man claimed to be an investigator with the police <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoodlums </ORGANIZATION> unit. He issued a high-priority call reporting that an officer had been wounded while pursuing a drug dealer Wednesday night, <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said. Police quickly surrounded a midcity area to search for the officer. The mysterious caller had initially asked dispatchers to run license plate checks on a number of cars, but when asked for a radio identification number, the caller went silent, police said. That number usually appears automatically on the dispatcher's screen and among other things is used to pinpoint a patrol car's Minutes later, the man radioed again, saying he was running after a suspected drug dealer, <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said. `` He then broadcast: ` Officer down,''' one of the department's highest priority calls, reserved for times when officers appear to be wounded, police Lt. <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobine </PERSON> said `` Because he was using police jargon, it was believable.'' Authorities were trying to determine how the caller was able to tap into restricted frequencies used by police for emergency calls. The man may have gotten his hands on a misplaced hand-held police radio, <PERSON> Freedman </PERSON> said. `` We do have missing Rover hand-held radios that have been stolen or lost,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people returned to their homes following a spectacular railroad explosion and fire, but the blast damage threatened a dangerous power shortage today as temperatures ranged to 38 below zero. `` We've got to minimize power usage right down to the last light bulb,'' said <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> division engineer for <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's that critical.'' As wind chills dipped to 70 below zero, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> troops relieved local firefighters late Thursday to monitor the explosion scene overnight and extinguish the last stubborn fires. `` We're just going to keep pouring water on it all night,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a National Guardsman stationed in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>. `` The cars that were the most threatening are now huge ice cubes.'' The wreckage continued to smolder this morning, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> disaster services coordinator. The temperature at 7 a.m. was 29 degrees below zero. Bitter cold weather that swept down out of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was indirectly responsible for the pre-dawn explosions that rocked <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s capital Thursday, severing power lines and showering some neighborhoods with shrapnel Authorities said the accident occurred when railroad workers tried to switch locomotives on a freight train because the heater in one locomotive had failed. Forty-eight freight cars rolled away during the switch, traveling nine miles into <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> before derailing and plowing into a propane tank. The tank exploded, authorities said, igniting a rail car filled with highly flammable hydrogen peroxide, which also exploded. But a second hydrogen peroxide car was coated with ice in the frigid cold, apparently preventing it from exploding. The owner of the propane tank said today that his tank did not explode. Only two minor injuries were reported, which <PERSON> Spengler </PERSON> termed `` miraculous,'' adding, `` We are all speculating what a disaster we'd have had if that had happened at the rush hour.'' It was one of two major train derailments in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> on Thursday. In the second, 52 <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> grain cars derailed near Glacier National Park, spilling more than 5,000 tons of corn and blocking tracks in both directions. The derailment forced <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> to suspend service indefinitely between <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The explosions in <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> scattered debris for a quarter-mile radius, showering a nearby college campus and sending a 1,500-pound coupling unit through a dormitory roof. Windows were blasted out of homes and businesses up to two miles away. About 2,000 residents were evacuated within a square-mile area around the blast site as the temperature hovered near 30 below zero. Power was knocked out in parts of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> for up to six hours. By Thursday night, the evacuation order had been lifted, although parts of neighborhoods near the blast site remained without power. <PERSON> Lamach </PERSON> said the strain on substations carrying re-routed power was so heavy that any further problems could force rolling blackouts throughout the city. Many homes in <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> rely on electricity as their primary source of heat. With forecasters predicting a high of 20 below zero today and a low of minus 38 tonight, officials pleaded with residents to cut back on all but essential electricity use. Mayor <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, who also is vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Carroll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said damage in the city was estimated at $ 3 million, with $ 2 million on the college campus. A cement plant near the blast also suffered extensive damage, authorities said. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said college officials hoped to have the 700 to 800 students evacuated from <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>'s three dormitories back in their rooms this weekend and to resume classes Monday. The students were staying in private homes while hundreds of windows in dormitories and other campus buildings were being repaired. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the chain of events began when a cab heater malfunctioned in a <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> locomotive hauling 48 freight cars over the <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Divide west of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>. The crew stopped the train to exchange locomotives and, in the process, set the freight cars loose. `` When the exchange of locomotives was complete, the crew returned to pick up the freight cars only to find they were gone,'' the federal agency said.

<HEAD>Wurst Case Scenario: Farmers Upset Over Ruling on Sausage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was bad enough when <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had to let foreign beers in. Now, fatty and gristly sausages from other countries will be competing alongside the beloved domestic wurst. Farming and meat industry officials are fuming over the ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s top court forcing <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to import wurst and other meat products that do n't measure up to the nation's purity laws. `` This is an extremely regrettable decision,'' said <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnieders </PERSON>, a spokesman for the West German <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. `` It amounts to allowing in products that West German law still forbids us to make.'' He said West German store shelves will soon be able to stock products `` colored with chemicals and filled with fat, blood, soya and milk-based lacto-proteins.'' The mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> tabloid bannered its story on the decision with the headline: `` Red Wurst!'' Wurst products are a traditional staple in the German diet. Food stores and butcher shops offer a wide range of wurst, including dozens of varieties of pork and liver sausage. Compared to the high prices of other meat products, wurst is relatively economical and can be used in many dishes. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> struck down the West German import restrictions on Thursday, saying they violated fair trade agreements among <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members. The court rejected <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s contention that plant proteins in meat products were less nourishing than all-meat varieties. While West German law allows some additives to meat products, their amount and nature are strictly limited. Thursday's decision followed a similar ruling two years ago, when <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was forced to allow the import of foreign beer that did not conform to the nation's brewing purity laws. That decision drew a loud outcry from the nation's brewers, who pride themselves as being among the world's best beer makers. The court's decision Thursday drew immediate calls for stricter labeling laws to make sure consumers know what they're buying. The reaction was n't all negative, however. The Bonn-based West German Consumer's <ORGANIZATION> Working </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> hailed the ruling, saying `` foreign products are not necessarily better or worse than local products.'' The group criticized the West German goverment's position on the imports. It said government resistance was aimed more at reducing competition for West German producers than protecting public health interests. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, in an editorial, said the government's position was untenable from the start, adding that `` those who want to eat soya wurst ought to be able to.'' Meat store owners in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> seemed undisturbed by the decision. `` Our customers are accustomed to the best and the purist products,'' said <PERSON> Gabriela </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, who works at a specialty butcher shop in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. `` We do n't expect that to change,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said from behind a counter well-stocked with a variety of German meat products. And the wurst-loving consumers? `` I prefer the German products because that's what I'm used to,'' said a shopper in downtown <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. `` But I'd still like the opportunity to choose between them and what the French, Belgians and Italians have to offer.'' `` It's all wurst to me,'' said another consumer, using a popular German slang phrase indicating indifference.

 The government claims that a man described as an international terrorist for carrying explosives on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> planned three bombings in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a defense attorney said today. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuby </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>'s attorney, said that in a pre-sentence report filed by the government, prosecutors claim his client targeted the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> building, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> recruiting office and an area of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s garment district. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> alleges <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, 36, is a member of the terrorist <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> who was secretly planning attacks in retaliation for the 1986 <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> would neither confirm nor deny reports that <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON> was acting at the direction of Libyan leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kikumura </PERSON>, convicted of illegally transporting explosives, possession of firearms by an alien, possession of unregistered firearms and carrying false travel documents, is to be sentenced Monday. <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said he would release the pre-sentence report later today. `` We are saying the attacks were planned by the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in retaliation for the bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Alito </PERSON> said. `` Any other reports are probably coming from the defense attorneys, and they are incorrect.''

<HEAD>Gov't Blasts Businesses For Raising Prices of Consumer Goods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government announced a crackdown Friday on state-owned businesses that have raised prices and cut the production of inexpensive products. The action, taking by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, or cabinet, was another attempt to ease chronic shortages of consumer goods. The council said it would require businesses to produce a minimum amount of inexpensive consumer goods and would ban price increases for items whose `` consumer properties change insignificantly,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Price increases for `` new and fashionable goods'' may not exceed 15 percent, the council decided. The decision was announced Friday, but had been approved in early January, <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voznesensky </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. It did not affect the burgeoning cooperative movement that has arisen under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said tackling the country's shortage of consumer goods and food is a top priority of his economic restructuring program. Because of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to make each factory pay its own way, however, Soviet managers are in effect encouraged to seek the highest markup they can on their products, and even to curtail manufacture of cheap goods that bring little return. The consumer goods shortages _ known as `` deficits'' _ have plagued the country for years, but Soviets complain that under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, new ones have appeared, including inexpensive items. One of the most talked about examples is soap. Soviets have flooded the official press with angry letters and grumbled privately that inexpensive soap has disappeared from shelves while expensive bars are plentiful. `` I am writing this letter out of happiness that my husband -LRB- according to a waiting list -RRB- received one bar of household soap and a tube of ` Zefir' toothpaste,'' one woman wrote sarcastically Dec. 28 in the labor daily Trud. `` I will take care of it to make sure it lasts long, because it's unknown when such good fortune will visit me again.'' For state-owned Soviet factories and other businesses, the problem is one of profits. They are required to be self-financing, meaning they must not spend more money than they take in and will not be bailed out by the government. As a result, many businesses have reduced production of inexpensive goods that bring in little money, and increased output of expensive items. Many Soviets complain they ca n't afford the costly alternatives on their meager salaries, which average about $ 333 monthly. They even charge that factory managers are withholding consumer goods from the stores to try to sabotage <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reforms. In October, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Belov </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, called the substitution of cheap goods with expensive alternatives `` hidden price hikes,'' and said that along with increases in wages, inflation had developed. He did not give a figure for inflation. Another decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> did pertain to cooperatives, but its immediate effects were uncertain. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said cooperatives will be allowed to buy `` non-scarce foods and non-edible commodities,'' presumably from the state, but that any products made from them should be sold at prices fixed for state-run retail shops. In the past, cooperative restaurants and other ventures could only buy supplies from other cooperatives or independent sources like the country's peasant markets.

 If his successors want to obliterate the stamp Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> put on <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, they will have to take down hundreds of pictures, rename towns and schools, and change the thinking habits of two generations. One of the biggest towns in this landlocked nation is <PERSON> Ciudad </PERSON> <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>'s airport bears his name and he had a huge neon sign erected in its central plaza to blink out the declaration, `` Stroessner: Peace, Work and Well-being.'' He seized power in 1954 and ruled for nearly 35 years _ longer than any leader in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> _ with a canny blend of military force, political patronage and self-discipline. The red-haired son of a Bavarian immigrant, whose mother was of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> heritage, began his military career at 20 and quickly distinguished himself. During his long rule, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> oversaw <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s transformation from a backwater with open sewers and no running water to a relatively prosperous and modern nation Then, on Friday, the 76-year-old general's era ended as it began, with a coup by his second-in-command, Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> won eight presidential elections despite opposition charges of fraud. Even his critics admit he helped stabilize <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. In the 31 years before he took over, it had 22 presidents. Yet, he also was accused of brutal repression and corruption, and his country became a haven for fugitive Nazis, drug traffickers and former dictators. Among the refugees were <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp doctor who became a citizen of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> in 1959 and was befriended by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> sympathizers; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochmann </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> `` Butcher of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION>''; ousted President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, who was assassinated in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>; drug trafficker <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricorde </PERSON>; and Croation militant and convicted assassin <PERSON> Miro </PERSON> <PERSON> Baresic </PERSON>. As convenient tools for keeping order, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> had his perpetual state of siege and Law 209 _ the Law for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> _ that gave his government the power to make sure there was no democracy to defend. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s ubiquitous approach to governing included innumerable speeches, sometimes lasting hours, in which he often would list his public works projects in great detail. Among the most impressive of those was the $ 16 billion Itaipu dam, the world's largest hydroelectrical project, built in partnership with neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. It began producing power in 1985. He attended hundreds of ground-breakings and other public ceremonies each year, even in outlying towns, and served regularly as a witness at weddings even when he did n't know the bride or groom. Spartan habits and a busy schedule were the reasons for his longevity and energy, he said. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> does not smoke and drinks little. Public dissatisfaction with the government became increasingly evident in the mid-1980s, when protesters and police clashed in the streets. The <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and even a faction of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> began criticizing the president, accusing him of repression and demanding democratic reforms Human rights groups said many of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s foes were tortured and killed during his early years in power. Others were jailed indefinitely, convicted of political crimes or forced into exile. He was a rabid anti-communist and staunch ally of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the general's relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> cooled when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration referred to his government as a dictatorship. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> attended <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s military academy, graduating in 1929, and as a 20-year-old lieutenant led a mortar platoon in the Chaco War with <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. He distinguished himself for bravery and rose quickly through the ranks, reaching the rank of general at age 40. He became army chief of staff in 1951. In the first four years after seizing power, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> put down five attempted coups by exiled politicians and began dismantling the political opposition. Using special powers under the state of siege, which was renewed every 90 days until last year, civilian and military police arrested thousands of opponents. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> referred to virtually all his opponents as subversives. Critics say his government promoted a side economy dominated by contraband. Many government and military officials, including relatives and close associates, became rich through ties with <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. The general is said to have been ill since a prostate operation five months ago. His apparent slow recovery increased demands by opposition leaders for a transition to democratic rule by the army and <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He and his wife, <PERSON> Eligia </PERSON>, have three children: <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON>, an air force colonel with many business interests; <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON>, a businessman, and <PERSON> Graciela </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Llamas </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Friday formally invited Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to come to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for their nations' first summit in 30 years, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> accepted. The meeting between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> will normalize relations that turned hostile in 1960 when their predecessors, <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>, quarreled over the border and leadership of the world communist movement. `` The coming Chinese-Soviet summit will be an event of great significance,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> as telling Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. He said the normalization of ties will `` help promote world peace and stability.'' `` It's official,'' <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Viatcheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said at a news briefing. He said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who has been in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since Wednesday, will make an announcement about the date Saturday after consulting with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. He said only a general time-frame may be announced, such as late April or mid-May. So far, both sides have said only that the summit should be held in the first half of the year. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the first Soviet foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 30 years, flew Friday night to <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for his meeting with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said he had heard <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for medical examinations, but later said he had heard only rumors, nothing official. Rumors that the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is in poor health have frequently circulated in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. After meeting <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will fly back to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for a news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The Soviets released few details of <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s meetings Friday with his Chinese counterpart, <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>, and the premier, but they confirmed the issue of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> was discussed for a second day. The Chinese-Soviet border, over which the two countries fought briefly in 1969, also was discussed, <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said. `` As far as I understand, he -LRB- <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> -RRB- was satisfied with the talks. He said some problems still have to be resolved and some things are left for Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but he was satisfied in general,'' <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Li </PERSON> as telling <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> his visit would give impetus to resolving the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> issue and `` remove a major obstacle to the normalization of relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had long refused to normalize ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> until, among other things, Soviet-allied <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> ended its occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Under pressure from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said it will pull out by September if a settlement can be reached on the makeup of a future government. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has agreed in principle to end its support to anti-Vietnamese guerrillas by then. Both the Soviets and Chinese have said during <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit they still differ on aspects of the Cambodian problem, but neither has disclosed the specific points of disagreement <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> stressed the withdrawal must be carried out under international supervision. The Vietnamese-installed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has rejected this in the past. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> canceled without explanation a planned sightseeing tour Friday to the <LOCATION> Forbidden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the former residence of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s emperors, and there was speculation he met with Cambodian resistence leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> spends much of each year in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and lives at the same state guesthouse as <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said he could not confirm the two met. Asked if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, like <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, wants <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to head a post-occupation government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said that is up to the Cambodians. <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> comes to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, it will also be `` natural'' to restore ties between the two countries' Communist parties, severed in the 1960s. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be coming in his capacity as Soviet president, but he also is secretary-general of the Soviet Communist Party. <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said restored party ties would allow for exchanges on ideological matters. Ideological differences were one of the key reasons for the 1960 split. Now, <PERSON> Duhin </PERSON> said, `` we do n't speak about ideology.''

<TEXT>
 When residents of other states telephone this spring to ask about vacation prospects in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the voice on the other end will belong to a state prisoner. Beginning in March, inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> will field inquiries for the Division of Travel and Tourism, Gov. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> announced Thursday. The 16 or so women will be instructed about vacation opportunities and on how to dispense advice, the governor said. The program should provide valuable job training for the inmates while improving the efficiency of the tourist-inquiry service, he said. Inmate labor has been used successfully for similar tasks in other states, said <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> drew criticism during his re-election campaign last year because of slow responses to out-of-state inquiries about vacation prospects in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. At one point in the summer, the backlog of unfilled requests for information neared 100,000, and critics said it was costing the state money in lost tourism dollars. The Division of Travel and Tourism has already used female prisoners to package travel brochures, eventually eliminating the backlog. Now, they will answer calls as well. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Guth </PERSON>, spokesman for the state corrections department, said the inmates will earn $ 1 a day, the standard rate of pay for state jobs done by prisoners. Male inmates can get jobs in printing, agriculture, and furniture making for the state, but the state's only women's prison has few similar jobs. `` There are just not a lot of opportunites for our women prisoners to work and this seemed like an ideal one,'' <PERSON> Guth </PERSON> said. `` And from a psychological standpoint, women offenders are generally better suited to this kind of work,'' <PERSON> Guth </PERSON> said. `` Male offenders are often rougher and committed rougher crimes than women offenders, and they are not the types you want answering questions on the phone. `` Even women offenders who commit murder generally did so as a result of abuse or some other factor and they better fit the psychological profile we want for this type of job.''

 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited a community services organization Friday, carrying bags full of donated toys and clothes and telling reporters `` we've got to help the working poor.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also scheduled her first media interviews since becoming first lady as she kept up a busy schedule before she and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left for their first weekend at Camp David. Earlier Friday, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> and praised the center's staff of volunteers `` It reinforces my belief that we have got to help the working poor,'' she told reporters during her 40-minute visit. The first lady helped carry from the trunk of her limousine seven plastic bags full of clothes and toys that she and members of the White House staff donated. The center is a private, non-profit organization whose programs include a thrift shop, food pantry, medical clinics, day care, counseling and financial assistance. In the thrift shop, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was joined by volunteers <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a member of the board of directors, and 78-year-old <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> as she looked over secondhand clothes being offered for sale at nominal prices.

 Bent against a wind that howls through <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s snow-covered mountains, Moslem insurgents with stocking feet covered only in sandals coax camel and mule supply convoys over rugged passes. The guerrillas say the snow that clogs the winding trails will confine their military activities mainly to harassment of communist troops until the spring thaw. They say the harsh weather prevents them from launching major assaults on Afghan cities vacated by the withdrawing Soviet army. Winter has turned the imposing peaks that have harbored the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Pakistan-backed guerrillas during their 10-year war against the communists into frigid citadels. The turbaned fighters huddled in blankets say that until spring, they will concentrate on weakening government forces by harassing them and blocking their overland supply routes of food and fuel. `` God willing, we are near to freedom,'' said <PERSON> Jabbar </PERSON>, already a seasoned guerrilla with the hard-line <PERSON> Yunis </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalis </PERSON> faction at the age of 24. Ten years ago, he traded his textbooks for a Soviet-made Kalashnikov assault rifle. `` But until the spring we ca n't do much,'' says <PERSON> Rahoney </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>, who along with his two brothers commands several hundred guerrillas in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s central and southern provinces of <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> pledged in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord to withdraw all of its more than 100,000 combat troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15. Half were out by August and the final pullout in under way. The <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> seized power in a 1978 coup, sparking the Moslem insurrection. Soviet soldiers marched in a year later to replace one pro-Moscow government with another, then remained to help it fight the burgeoning civil war. Negotiations for the accord, signed by <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, excluded the guerrillas, who say it was their own persistence that forced the Soviets to leave. The guerrillas, some wearing Soviet-made fur hats and woolen uniform pants captured from fallen government posts, said morale within their loose ranks is rising peaking while the morale among <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> troops is at an ebb. `` They are very nervous,'' says <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>. With the Soviets pulling out of the country `` they ca n't imagine what will happen to them.'' The guerrillas have promised amnesty to defecting troops. `` If the Soviets really leave, regime forces will fall down on their own,'' said <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON>. `` If they really take their hands off of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> then the -LRB- fighting -RRB- can be finished in a short time.'' In the eastern Afghan city of <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, about 100 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, guerrillas divided into small cells of 15 have breached the government's security belt and are inside the city limits. About 2,000 government troops are posted in more than 130 positions in and around <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>. Guerrillas say half are from the ranks of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s elite Tsarandoy police and half from the <LOCATION> Khad </LOCATION> state security force. Until the Soviets pulled out of the city of 100,000 last year, guerrilla access to it was severely curtailed by <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops who stalked the perimeter and ambushed squads. `` When the Russians were in <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION>, every day there was an ambush,'' said <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raqib </PERSON>, a commander in the city. But he said communist troops stay within the confines of their posts when returning fire. A handful of guerrillas, one wearing a captured Soviet-issued tank helmet, moved within the <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> city limits to within several hundred feet of its ancient <LOCATION> Balahisar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION>, which seems inpregnable from its perch overlooking the city. The guerrillas harass troops in the bastion with 82mm rockets. `` We do n't expect to capture the fort, we just want to keep the government off guard,'' said <PERSON> Raqib </PERSON>. Within minutes, a tank rumbles out and indiscriminately blasts away in the direction of the guerrillas' fire. He said the only time the troops venture out is when the fort is attacked, and only then in tanks. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> began withdrawing, government posts in the countryside began falling to guerrillas. The insurgents now move freely from neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where much of their weapons and ammunition originate. Obscure villages with names like <LOCATION> Loghari </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ya </PERSON> <PERSON> Khiel </PERSON> are memorials to Soviet-Afghan war dead and testimonials to guerrilla tenacity. Rusting Soviet-made T-62 tanks and military vehicles are partially buried in the snow outside <LOCATION> Bandi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sadr </LOCATION>. In <PERSON> Ya </PERSON> <PERSON> Khiel </PERSON>, guerrillas with rocket-propelled grenade launchers slung over their shoulders climb over the remains of a Soviet-made helicopter. The guerrillas want the major cities to collapse from within. `` We have adopted this strategy because the civilians are afraid of -LRB- retaliatory Soviet -RRB- bombing raids,'' he said. Because of this, he said, the cities will stay in communist hands until the snow melts away and the last of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has gone home.

 A 137-year-old covered bridge that survived floods, tornadoes and an assault by Confederate troops was done in by a gasoline leak and a car with a hot catalytic converter, officials said Friday. The 312-foot <PERSON> Philippi </PERSON> Covered Bridge, the longest two-lane covered bridge still in use on a federal highway, was destroyed by fire Thursday night. <LOCATION> Philippi </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattaliano </PERSON> said he hoped the state can repair the bridge, which carried <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 250 over the <LOCATION> Tygart </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. State Department of Highways officials were optimistic Friday morning that the bridge's steel and concrete base was still structurally sound. They planned a more thorough inspection later in the day. A pool of gasoline that had trickled about 100 feet from a nozzle being used to fill gas tanks at a service station was set off by a car driving over the bridge, said firefighter <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>. `` Apparently, the car's catalytic converter ignited the fuel,'' said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>. `` The women in the car said they heard a whoosing sound and jumped out when they saw the road on fire.'' No one was injured in the incident. <PERSON> Mattaliano </PERSON>, who was driving across the bridge when it caught fire, said, `` I saw a wall of fire coming at me in my rear view mirror. I got off the bridge in a hurry and called the Fire Department.'' The bridge, built in 1852 by <PERSON> Lemuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenoweth </PERSON>, was known for its arched, all-poplar frame held together by iron bolts. It survived a 1910 flood and received minor damage in a 1985 blood. During the Civil War, fleeing Confederate troops tried to burn the bridge to prevent Union troops from following, but the attempt failed. `` This bridge is part of the history of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Mattaliano </PERSON>. `` It survived floods and tornadoes.'' With its loss, <PERSON> Philippi </PERSON>, a town of 3,700 people about 20 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Clarksburg </LOCATION>, was left with only one other bridge, and <PERSON> Mattaliano </PERSON> predicted traffic backups until the covered bridge could be repaired.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> enters talks this weekend in a bid to forge a political settlement from nine years of futile intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s civil war His 17-hour visit, beginning Saturday night, caps a week of hectic diplomatic efforts to avert more bloodshed as the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> continues its troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will be talking to officials of the <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> government, which has backed and sheltered the most powerful guerrilla forces fighting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed regime. `` We hope our talks with the Soviet leader will pave the way for a peaceful settlement, although the situation on the ground in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> is depressing,'' a Pakistani government spokesman said this week. He was referring to bitter fighting between communist forces and Moslem guerrillas. Some of the worst reported attacks have occurred along the main Soviet withdrawal route from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> north to the Soviet border. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> signed a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> accord last spring providing for removal of the approximately 100,000 Soviet combat troops by Feb. 15. Although the last units are said to be en route home, there still are no prospects for peace between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s communist government and tenacious Moslem insurgents armed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and other Islamic countries. All sides agree on the need for a settlement that will produce a broad-based government to succeed the current regime, which seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> insists that such a new government should retain some of his officials. However, the guerrillas consider the communists traitors for inviting the Soviets to intervene in December 1979 and refuse to negotiate with them. In addition, the guerrillas can not agree among themselves on how to form a transitional regime leading to a post-war Islamic republic of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The insurgents' seven major parties, Sunni Moslem groups headquartered in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, are at odds with Shiite Moslem insurgent groups based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over proportional repesentation in a grand `` consultative council'' that is to lay groundwork for a new government. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> flew to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> earlier this week for two days of talks. When he departed Thursday, he said only that the anti-government forces of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> should work together to restore peace. In addition to backing the insurgents, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also shelter more than 5 million Afghan refugees. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is the highest-ranking <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official to visit <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in more than 20 years. He initiated the trip himself, said a <ORGANIZATION> Pakistani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on condition of anonymity. The spokesman did not disclose the agenda.

<HEAD>New Preservative Can Aid Liver Transplants, Doctors Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new preservative is keeping livers for transplantation alive outside the body up to three times as long as before and could significantly increase the number of successful transplants, experts said Friday. Researchers from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> reported in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that the chilled mixture can preserve human livers outside the body for 24 hours. Dr. <PERSON> Satoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Todo </PERSON>, who headed a six-member research team at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, said that since the article was written, the solution has been used to keep livers viable as long as 34 hours. The old time limit was about 9 -LCB- hours. Given the critical shortage of donor livers and their relatively quick deterioration outside the body, the new solution could greatly aid liver transplantation and increase the distances livers can be transported to get the best match between donor organ and recipient, experts said. The mixture, UW-lactobionate, has also been used to extend the viability of pancreases from six hours to more than 24 hours, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Southard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> biochemist who helped develop the solution, said. It has proven as effective for kidneys as the conventional method, capable of preserving the organ for 30 to 40 hours. Experimentation with preserving hearts still is limited to animals. So far, dog hearts have been preserved for 12 hours, compared to the conventional three to four hours, he said. `` It's badly needed in hearts,'' <PERSON> Southard </PERSON> said. Under the older preservation method, livers are chilled and flushed with Euro-Collins solution, a mix of electrolytes and glucose. The new solution, which includes hormones, amino acids and sugars, is being tested on liver transplant patients in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and 20 to 30 other centers worldwide. An additional 100 or so transplant centers are using it for kidneys and pancreases. UW-lactobionate has not been cleared by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for general use. Developers applied for <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval last August, and approval could come at any time, <PERSON> Southard </PERSON> said. `` The remarkable effectiveness of the <ORGANIZATION> UW </ORGANIZATION> solution has revolutionized liver transplantation at almost every level,'' <PERSON> Todo </PERSON> wrote in the journal. `` The enhanced margin of safety has permitted more effective use of organs that can be stored safely while waiting for operating room facilities or personnel to become available.'' In their study, <PERSON> Todo </PERSON>'s group found that transplants of 185 livers preserved with the new solution for up to 24 hours were more successful than 180 livers preserved up to 9 -LCB- hours with the old mixture. The researchers measured success by the need for another transplant and the rate of clotting of the main artery leading to the liver. <PERSON> Todo </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> solution limits swelling in the transplanted organ. One liver preserved with the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> solution, but not included in the study, was shipped last fall from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and successfully transplanted, <PERSON> Southard </PERSON> said. `` It was the first inter-continental sharing of livers,'' he said. Another liver was shipped from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. Since the solution was first used in August 1987 at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, doctors there have used it to preserve about 80 livers and 50 pancreases, according to <PERSON> Southard </PERSON>. As a result, surgeons can now schedule liver transplants at 8 a.m. rather than rush around in the middle of the night. `` If you do it at midnight after you've done a full day's work, with the emergency crew rather than the nurses and anaesthesiologists who should be there, it's not as safe for the patient,'' <PERSON> Southard </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, about 600 livers have been transplanted after being preserved in the mixture, <PERSON> Tudo </PERSON> said. Liver transplant surgeons at both institutions have abandoned the more conventional preservation method.

The column of trucks and tanks began their 260-mile journey north up the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> under cover of darkness, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The 1,000 to 1,500 Soviet soldiers still in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> will guard the city's airport during food airlifts that are to continue for at least a week, the sources said. Under an accord sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to end the Soviets' nine-year intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> has until Feb. 15 to withdraw. Guerrillas fighting the pro-Marxist government since 1978 are not a party to the agreement and say they will take over when the Soviets are gone. President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, however, said Thursday that his conscript army, believed to number 140,000, was prepared to repel the insurgents. A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> human rights report issued Friday said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Afghan army had violated international law during the withdrawal by sowing mines, many of them in civilian areas. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> workers who visited <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in June found Soviet mines in agricultural areas, rivers and villages, and said the number of explosives ranged from 5 million to 30 million, according to the report to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` Mines designed to cause unnecessary suffering have been widely dispersed throughout <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` This is a clear violation of customary and conventional international law.'' Many diplomats say the Afghan civil war will become a bloodbath when the Soviets are gone, and most major Western countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, closed their embassies in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> this week. Heavy snow Friday delayed the departure of British diplomats and their staff, who were to leave on a chartered plane for <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, government officials in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said. There was no immediate word on when they would leave. Soviet flags Friday were replaced with the red, green and black flags of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and Afghan soldiers took over the Soviet outposts along the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. Afghan soldiers said the Soviet convoy snaked through the <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> and the mountains where guerrillas have pounded departing contingents with artillery fire in recent days. The sources said they did not know how many vehicles or soldiers were in the latest convoy but that it took three hours for it to depart. Early this week, Western and Soviet diplomats said about 15,000 Soviet soldiers remained. A Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office coordinating relief for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said Friday that it planned to airlift food and medicine to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, whose population has swollen to 2 million because of refugees streaming into the city. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed an agreement in principle had been reached with Afghan guerrillas not to shoot down incoming relief planes. In return, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has pledged to send more relief supplies into regions controlled by the guerrillas. Also on Friday, officials in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denied claims by <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> that Pakistani jet fighters shot down an Afghan passenger plane. Official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, monitored in the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> Thursday night, said the plane was carrying food suppplies from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, 12 miles from the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border, when it strayed off course Tuesday. It said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> ignored the pilot's call for help and shot it down, killing all five passengers and a crew of nine. Pakistani military spokesman <PERSON> Riaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullah </PERSON> said the Afghan plane crashed inside <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> territory apparently after running out of fuel during a possible attempt to defect. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> back the guerrillas, who began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. The Soviet soldiers entered the country in December 1979, and grew in number to an estimated 115,000 by the time the pullout began May 15. <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the Soviet foreign minister, will meet with <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> leaders Saturday to discuss ways to end the civil war.

<HEAD>What, Brazil Worry? It's Time for Carnival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inflation is 1,000 percent, corruption charges abound, hospitals are closed because staffs have n't been paid. Does anyone worry? Next week during Lent, sure, but right now it's Carnival! <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s famous annual party runs from Saturday through Wednesday and the nation's 140 million people, at least those in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, seem determined as usual to set aside their woes for a few days. `` Carnival is a time of renewal. It is a balsam,'' said <PERSON> Trajano </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON>, president of the municipal tourism board Riotur. `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has serious problems, but that's no reason not to enjoy Carnival.'' The Scala nightclub, site of some of the most raucous Carnival balls, announce plans to stock a ton of filet mignon, 650 pounds of shrimp, 210 cases of scotch and 2,600 gallons of draft beer. `` Brazilians are naturally happy people,'' said <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Coure </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, another center of Carnival fun. `` Carnival emotion is a great phenomenon,'' `` I just spent a month in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and the people over there looked sad,'' he said. `` And they do n't have inflation.'' Coure's main ballroom has a silver-and-gold Arabian Nights motif this year. Major Carnival balls draw 6,000-10 ,000 people each and are covered on live television Among the best known are the Grande Gala G for homosexuals and the Bum Bum Ball, featuring a competition of paintings rendered on the fundaments of young women. <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> said `` a special police protection system for foreigners'' had been established because of increasing street crime in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>, and suggested visitors stay together in organized groups. `` It is not recommended for foreigners to go about on their own,'' he said. Some Americans, West Germans, Italians, Israelis and Argentines who arrived early got an unpleasant initiation when a band of thieves armed with pistols and crowbars invaded their hotel on <LOCATION> Ipanema </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. They shouted `` Happy Carnival!'' broke open guest safes in the lobby, and made off with $ 190,000 worth of cash, traveler's checks, credit cards, cameras and airline tickets. <PERSON> Rio </PERSON>'s `` samba school'' parade _ held in two 15-hour sessions Sunday and Monday nights _ is the undisputed highlight of Carnival. Each of the 18 `` schools,'' neighborhood clubs generally located in poor districts where most residents are black, puts as many as 5,000 dancers in dazzling costumes on the six blocks of open-air paradeway known as the Sambadrome. Schools compose their own melodies and lyrics each year. Each has a theme for its constumes and floats and its own rhythm beaters who drive the display with a powerful African-tropical beat on hundreds of drums and other percussion instruments. Themes usually are about mystical kingdoms or events in Brazilian history, but this year one's school's lyrics deal with the racism many say still exists in this huge, racially diverse nation. One part, translated from <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION>, goes: `` I'm black, yes. Freedom and poetry. And in today's society, we are fighting for equality.'' A continuing controversy is whether the samba parade is being taken away from `` the people'' for the benefit of entrepreneurs. Riotur charges foreigners the equivalent of $ 213 for the best parade seats, but also returns $ 150,000 to each samba school to help pay for costumes and floats. <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> said this means `` ordinary Brazilians can participate in Carnival.'' In the other 51 weeks of the year, most of the dancers and musicians are anonymous toilers for the government minimum wage equal to about $ 2 a day. A newly formed `` <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Samba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'' has negotiated for greater revenue from television and advertising rights for the parade. <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> said the league wants to turn Carnival into `` a media event _ show biz.'' The head of the samba league, a banker of the illegal-but-tolerated numbers game called Capt. <LOCATION> Guimaraes </LOCATION>, told a newspaper: `` The samba schools are the ones who provide the show. The authorities want us to hold the cow's legs, while they take the milk.''

<HEAD>Panel to Develop Plan for Federal Court System's Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A committee created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to develop within 15 months a long-range plan for the federal court system's future held its first meeting Friday, and its chairman warned against `` ideological warfare. `` The assignment is breathtaking ... a pioneering effort,'' said chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a federal appeals judge from <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> said the committee would work toward issuing by April 1990 a report recommending, among other things, what role federal courts should play in the 21st century. He said the committee plans to conduct public hearings in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> within the next 45 days so legal groups, civic organizations and anyone else interested may suggest what topics should come under review. <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> said the committee, whose 15 members include officials from each of the federal government's three branches, will study the federal judiciary's structure, its relationship to state courts and the types of cases it should be handling. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, D-Wis., told fellow committee members they should avoid ideological discussions about the role of federal courts so that their efforts are not perceived as `` court-stripping'' attempts Past efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to limit the purview of federal courts _ such as blocking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review of all cases involving school prayer or abortion _ have proved controversial. <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, saying, `` I did n't intend to get into any ideological warfare.'' Besides <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kastenmeier </PERSON>, the committee's members are Sens. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Calif.; <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Aprile </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advocacy </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Callow </PERSON>, chief justice of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Also federal trial judges <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabranes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Keep </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>; federal appellate judges <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; private lawyers <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribbon </PERSON> <PERSON> Motz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, professor of law at <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

 Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> is a farmer's son who found his niche in the military, rising to command its most elite unit and ultimately overthrowing the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s longest-ruling leader <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was second-in-command to President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, the military dictator and personal friend he ousted Friday. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who is believed to be 64, grew up in the town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, 250 miles east of the capital. He left his rustic beginnings for a career in the military, and in 1961 was named commander of the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Benefit by Artists for Magazine, Relatives of Dissidents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Chinese artists held an exhibition Friday night to raise money for the relatives of jailed dissidents, rekindle a once-banned literary magazine and set up a foundation to publish controversial political essays. The artists, who live in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and abroad, were once members of the Star group, an underground art and political society that flourished briefly during a period of relative political freedom 10 years ago. The exhibition was held in the apartment of a Western European diplomat and attended mostly by foreigners and Chinese artists. At least nine of the 25 works of art were sold, raising about $ 5,405 for the group, said <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wanding </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> dissident who was jailed from 1979 to 1983 for advocating multiparty democracy. All the buyers were foreigners. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said some of the money will be used to help people whose relatives were jailed for political reasons. Amnesty International says thousands of people are in jail in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for their beliefs _ religious, political or otherwise. <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, an electrician who was active in the 1979 Democracy Wall movement, and <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenli </PERSON>, a leading figure in the pro-democracy April 5 Forum, are two of the best known political prisoners. Both were sentenced to 15 years in prison in 1979 for `` counterrevolutionary activities.'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said some money also will go to the rebirth of Today magazine, a periodical of experimental poetry and short stories that was published underground from 1979 until it was banned in late 1980. During its time, the organizers of Today escaped jail terms because the periodical was purely literary and avoided politics. <PERSON> Bei </PERSON> <PERSON> Dao </PERSON>, a well-known poet, said the new magazine would follow the same line. <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said the remaining money will be used to start a foundation to help political thinkers publish essays that can not find a place in the state-run press. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s publishing industry, including its newspapers and magazines, are all under state control. State-published books and magazines are censored for political material. Recently, the country has witnessed a flourishing of illegal publishing houses. Most print pornography or translations of risque novels from the West, and very few concentrate on politics or other intellectual subjects. Over the past 18 months, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has allowed debate to flourish on the economy and art, but talk about political reform has been scant. Several of the Star group's artists, who have since emigrated from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, returned to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the exhibition. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Keping </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most famous sculptors who lives in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, said he came back to help his own friends. `` They wanted money, but we artists are poor,'' he said. `` So we decided to give them some of our works to help them.''

<TEXT>
 News of a secret two-day meeting at a West German hotel reveals that after years of baleful silence, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> politicians are talking again across the communal divide. But the sudden glare of publicity threatens to push them back into their trenches. For war-weary Northern Irelanders, the report that dominated BBC-TV news Thursday night was electrifying: leading Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> politicians had spent two days in a Duisburg hotel in October working out a proposed formula for jointly governing the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province under a form of autonomy known as `` devolved government.'' But by Friday, party leaders from all sides had poured cold water on the notion, accusing the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> of over-dramatizing its story. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, who as leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the province's top <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> politician, called it nonsense. <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, the hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Molyneaux </PERSON>, leader of the Official Unionists, the larger, more moderate Protestant party, also denied any negotiations had taken place on the form of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s future government The meeting was arranged by an unidentified German clergyman and was attended by <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s deputy, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of the Official Unionists; <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> of the mainly Catholic SDLP; and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>, deputy leader of the Alliance, a small, strictly non-sectarian party. It was followed up over the past four months by talks in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing, was not invited. <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> insisted Friday that despite the pooh-poohing from party leaders, progress was made. The mere act of talking was significant, he said in an interview, because stalemate has prevailed ever since the signing of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> a say in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s affairs Protestant politicians, who regard the agreement as a gross foreign intrusion into the affairs of their 1 million followers, have refused to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION> unless the accord is shelved. The <ORGANIZATION> SDLP </ORGANIZATION>, having helped midwife the pact on behalf of the 600,000-strong <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority, predictably rejects that condition. Thus for more than three years, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> politics has amounted to little more than a prolonged sulk, leaving the field open to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and its extremist Protestant counterparts. Since the agreement was signed, 258 more lives have been lost. `` What was different about Duisburg in many respects was that the parties agreed that instead of us all going home and putting our feet up, we would see if there was any basis for moving forward,'' said <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>. A basis was found, he said, in `` a form of words'' which the participants felt they could present to their leaders for further discussion. He said it entailed agreement on devolved government as the best way forward and putting the Anglo-Irish Agreement aside for a fixed period while negotiations continued at a higher level. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> confirmed that he and the three other parties agreed that `` to facilitate dialogue,'' it was worth considering a suspension of the main workings of the agreement _ the periodic meetings between <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> ministers to discuss Ulster's affairs. The Anglo-Irish Agreement broke the Irish logjam by forcing the Protestants to realize that they had lost their traditional veto over any compromise with the Catholics. `` But it created another logjam downstream,'' said <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>. A key question is whether the Irish and British governments, which signed the agreement, are willing to see it put on ice. The widely held assumption here is that they will go along with anything that offers real prospects for peace. Another question is whether the publicity has killed the initiative. Already, angry words have been exchanged among the participants over who was to blame for the story getting out. `` The nature of Northern -LRB- Irish -RRB- politics is that progress can only be made behind closed doors, and when it comes out into the open people tend to scurry back to secure positions,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s former foreign minister who helped negotiate the 1985 agreement. <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said the Duisburg parley reflected `` a new realism'' among <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> politicians _ a willingness `` to look at the other side of the equation, to say ` yes, I recognize that you have a problem, but you must recognize that I have a problem too, and how can we overcome these problems?'''

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the Salvadoran government today that democracy, eocnomic growth and respect for human rights `` go hand in hand'' as he pledged a continuing relationship between the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. In a toast during a luncheon for government officials at the home of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> repeatedly mentioned commitment to human rights as a guiding principle for democratic government. Earlier today, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was urged by Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, acting as a go-between for a peace proposal by anti-government rebels, to consider the dissidents' point of view. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in his toast that under <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s five-year term <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>'s human rights record has improved but that `` there are challenges yet to be met and hurdles that must be overcome.'' `` And the anti-democratic forces of the extreme left and the extreme right are ideologically exhausted and weakened,'' he said. But, he added, `` they're still out there.'' He assured the Salvadorans of the commitment of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to a shared vision of a secure democratic future in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. `` This is a vision of democracy, economic growth and respect for human rights. The three go hand in hand,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He made the comments following morning meetings with representatives of <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> or ARENA, two of the parties vying to win next month's presidential election. During his meeting with the archbishop, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in the interest of helping Salvadorans move toward peace and democracy, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s press secretary. Strife-torn <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> relies heavily on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid of some $ 1.5 million per day. Flying to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was taken by helicopter from the airport to a point near the residence of Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, which was surrounded by security personnel. He then got into a motorcade where press vans were equipped with one-inch-thick windows against possible attack. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was expected to discuss with <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and other political leaders a proposal in which the rebels offered for the first time to participate in elections if certain conditions are agreed to. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials view the proposal as significant because it marks a departure from the rebels' demand for power-sharing, but say a decision on whether to act on it is in the hands of <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> and his government. As part of their proposal, the rebels want the March 19 elections postponed until September. While that would violate the Constitution's election timetable, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said outright rejection of the plan could be used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opponents of aid to argue that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s government is not serious about seeking peace `` It would present some obstacles'' to winning continued aid, the official said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s talks Thursday with presidents of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> were among the 10 bilateral sessions he held during a hectic visit to <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> for the inauguration of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, author of a regional peace plan signed in August 1987 by the five Central American presidents, said after meeting with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that he was optimistic the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would allow further regional diplomatic efforts to proceed instead of moving to restock the Nicaraguan rebels with weapons. `` Mr. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told me they want to give us a chance,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters there is now a `` hiatus'' with no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move to renew funding for the Contras battling <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. Although he contended that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s record on civil liberties has regressed since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the Contras, he said: `` We are going to give the diplomatic route a chance.'' `` This is a testing period for us,'' to see if Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is serious about holding free elections and implementing democratic reforms he agreed to in the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan. Asked how the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would differ from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s hardline pro-Contra policies, <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> adviser <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguilar-Urbina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is more pragmatic and that Latins feel positively about his presidency so far. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> criticized former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who also attended the Venezuelan inauguration, for meeting with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` Obviously when you have a former president meeting with heads of state we do n't meet with, it has a chance of complicating matters,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said at a news conference. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has refused to hold talks with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> had shared with him and <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> a new peace proposal regarding the Contras. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> did not release details, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they had heard only general components of the <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> proposal. They said it dealt with resettlement of the Contras into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> once peace is declared. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> also talked at length with Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> at the inauguration ceremony. <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> met at length with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, asking his support for the regional peace initiative. President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> also met with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> shortly before <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>' meeting with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> Thursday night. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he was pleased with his own meetings. `` You can feel the good chemistry,'' he said, adding that the Latin leaders appeared to be `` positive'' about dealing with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration.

 An army general today seized power from President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> in a coup that ended the military dictator's 34-year grip on power and reportedly left hundreds of soldiers and civilians dead. Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s second-in-command and whose daughter is married to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s son, said in a nationwide radio address the commander-in-chief was under house arrest. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> later took the oath as provisional president, then swore in a nine-member Cabinet that included seven civilians, one active general and one retired general. A message read over national radio and reportedly signed by <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> said the 76-year-old ruler resigned as president and army commander. Sources said the coup occurred after <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was ordered to resign. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, who was the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>'s longest-ruling leader, was given 12 hours to leave <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and chose exile in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION> reported. In <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Errazuriz </PERSON> said no asylum request for <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> had been received. About a dozen bodies of soldiers loyal to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> lay outside the headquarters of the presidential guard, and radio stations reported by military and civilian casualties, but there was no official death toll. Opposition leader <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON> put the death toll at 250. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, of the Roman Catholic station <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caritas </ORGANIZATION>, said `` there are reports of more than 100 dead'' but that the figures were `` speculative.'' The gray, colonial-style police headquarters was pockmarked with bullet holes, its windows shattered. Armed soldiers manned roadblocks in front of the nearby National Palace, which was not damaged, and at checkpoints throughout the city of 900,000. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s arrest followed eight hours of gunfights and cannon fire in the capital's streets between rebel soldiers backed by tanks and mortars and forces loyal to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. Witnesses reported seeing 40 to 50 tanks moving through the city streets late Thursday when the uprising began. `` Order has been re-established, and with it all the human values of our entire constitution will be respected,'' said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a career army officer allied with a faction of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favoring democratic reforms. `` I communicate to you that Gen. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> has surrendered and finds himself in perfect health, deprived of liberty, being shown all human rights, at a residence within the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said in the radio broadcast, speaking in a clipped, authoritarian voice. Diplomats and political sources said shortly before the coup that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, for unknown reasons, apparently was ordered to give up his command and retire or accept the post of defense minister. He refused. The rebellion also followed a dispute within the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> between a militant pro-Stroessner faction and traditionalists who wanted to distance the 100-year-old party from the aging dictator. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a senior research fellow at the liberal-leaning Council on Hemispheric Affairs in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> acted `` in order to prevent others, including <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s son, from seizing power as the aged and sickly dictator was losing his grip. White, who just returned from a trip to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, said `` <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s talk of democratization and human rights is merely a camouflage for his intention to continue the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regimen.'' Between cars with tires shot flat, several large bloodstains dried in the oppressive heat of this tropical city. `` We're happy the government is gone, but we're sad that people had to die,'' said one woman in the capital. She said the shelling and small arms fire forced her to spend Thursday night in a restaurant. Radio Itapiru reported that 32 government officials, including <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s long-time private secretary <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdo </PERSON> <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON>, were arrested and being held at a naval base. A member of the 3,000-man presidential guard, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said `` there was practically no battle. They did n't even ask us to surrender. They just opened fire and battered down the gates with small tanks.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was monitoring the situation. `` We do n't like violence, of course, and we hope that whatever government emerges will embrace democracy.'' <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was the absolute ruler of this landlocked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country since seizing power in a 1954 military coup that ousted President <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was army commander-in-chief, doled out political favors and jobs to his allies, and labeled his opponents Marxist subversives. Under <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> developed a record of providing refuge to fugitive Nazis, ousted dictators, and drug traffickers. The list includes <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp doctor <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mengele </PERSON>; the ousted Nicaraguan dictator, Gen. <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Debayle </PERSON>; and heroin kingpin <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> August </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricorde </PERSON>. A staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was criticized for human rights abuses by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and in 1986 the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration labeled his government a dictatorship. He has been in poor health since prostate surgery five months ago. Radio reports quoted an infantry division commander, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Otazu </PERSON>, as saying the uprising was not `` insubordination but a correction.'' Col. <PERSON> Dionisio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabello </PERSON> told March 1 radio he was the new air force commander and pledged allegiance to <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, who is believed to be 64 years old. Infantry divisions in three interior cities _ <LOCATION> Villarrica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bautista </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Concepcion </PERSON> _ and an air force unit sided almost immediately with the rebel soldiers, radio reports indicated.

 A suggestion from advice columnist <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> may have started a run on the red ribbon and paper doily market, say organizers of a valentine drive for Veterans Administration hospital patients. Nearly a quarter of a million cards _ many of them homemade _ had been received by Thursday, said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Surges </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Hines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, in the western <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs, is the national clearing house for the card drive, which is part of the Feb. 12-18 National Salute to Hospitalized Veterans. `` We have more than 200,000 cards and we still have more than a week-and-a-half until Valentine's Day,'' Ms. <PERSON> Surges </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday night. `` We've been told to expect about 1 million of them. They've been coming from every state in the union, plus <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. We've even had one from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.'' `` The valentine drive was our idea, and when we told <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Landers </PERSON> about it she said, ` Yes, this is great!''' Ms. <PERSON> Surges </PERSON> said. `` She hopped on the idea right away, and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> gave us their cooperation, too.

 A state senator has introduced a bill to repeal a 1923 law that, if enforced, he says, would have caused the arrest of almost every dancing teen-ager in the state at least since the dawn of rock' n' roll. The old `` blue law,'' among other things, requires that public dancing places be brightly illuminated. It outlaws dances that are `` indecent'' and `` immoral'' or are `` characterized by immodest motion of the body,'' and prohibits public dances from 1 a.m. to 6 a.m. and from 1 a.m. and noon on Sunday. `` What we've in effect been doing is practicing behavior that's not legal,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, 59 It was <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Towle </PERSON>, who brought the archaic law to his attention. She's the associate administrator at the <ORGANIZATION> Coffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> campus, where officials have puzzled over, then ignored, the statute for years. `` I can tell you right now that the number of dances with bright lights at <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> is none,'' <PERSON> Towle </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> confesses to dancing in rooms that were merely `` partially lit,'' his daughter doubts it could have gotten him into too much trouble. `` My mom and dad dance a lot,'' <PERSON> Towle </PERSON> said. `` But they would've never been arrested under that law.

<HEAD>China Offered Alternative To Cheesy New York Pizza</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A former <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law student said Friday he is signing a contract to open a not entirely New York-style pizzeria in the Chinese capital where customers can hold the cheese and instead pile on the pork. `` <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents should be able to afford to eat there four or five times a month,'' said entrepreneur <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON>. `` I think they will come No. 1 for the atmosphere, but No. 2 for the food. Over time, they'll develop a taste for the food.'' He said he plans to decorate the 600-seat restaurant, which will also offer takeout service, with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> street signs and play American pop music. The obstacles are formidable. Cheese is not part of the Chinese diet, and many Chinese do n't like it on first bite. However, they will be allowed to order cheese-less pizza with tomato sauce, vegetables and pork, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s staple meat, <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> said. `` We're not going to change the recipe of the pizza; it'll be authentic, but when it comes to toppings, we'll take a lot of Chinese input,'' <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> said. `` They may want sea-slug pizza.'' The 26-year-old remembers craving pizza in vain when he was studying law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1986. Foreigners now can buy local chefs' versions of pizza at several Western-run hotels, but there is no restaurant selling mainly pizza to Chinese. <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> said the company he founded, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will sign a joint venture contract Saturday with the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yanhai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. He said the Chinese are putting up $ 1.8 million, including the site in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. His side will put up $ 1.2 million and train the staff in the arcane craft of making thin-crust, New York-style pizzas. Ground-breaking on the restaurant is scheduled for March 1, and <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> said it will be open by May 1, 1990. About a mile away, managers at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s first Western fast-food restaurant, <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, have been licking their fingers over the good business. They say they sell an average of 1,300 chickens a day, more than any other restaurant in the chain worldwide. <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> said his pizza restaurant will be even larger. `` This has got to be the biggest pizza restaurant in the world. Where else in the world would there be a need for such a big restaurant?'' he asked. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has 10 million residents. <PERSON> Rosenzweig </PERSON> said about $ 1.70 will buy a slice of pizza and glass of soda.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> on Friday the two economic superpowers `` still face a difficult agenda,'' but he expressed hope the partnership will grow stronger as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> assumes a broader world role. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> bid <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> farewell at the end of the Japanese leader's two-day visit with an elaborate <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> luncheon featuring champagne toasts, pheasant and ice cream with mangoes <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> met with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday. For his part, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> pledged to cooperate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in tackling sensitive economic and security issues. `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is determined to do its utmost to collaborate with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, its strongest ally, for the peace and security of the world,'' the prime minister said, in his toast. `` No problems are unsolvable as long as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> join in an effort to solve them,'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said. At the lunch, the new secretary of state tried to praise <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s tax policies by turning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` No new taxes _ read my lips'' slogan into Japanese. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s attempt drew appreciative chuckles from the Japanese and Americans in the dining room. `` Our economies are still the largest in the free world and we still face a difficult agenda,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We can work it out. ... Together we will forge a new and even stronger partnership.'' `` It is indeed reassuring to know that his capable leadership will guide <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in assuming a larger role in world affairs,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was leaving Friday night for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and a meeting there next week with former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Earlier Friday, he paid a get-acquainted call on key leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where criticism has emerged over an $ 8 billion joint U.S-Japanese project to build jet fighters using American F-16 technology. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> met behind closed doors with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., and other senators involved in trade and foreign affairs issues A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide said the touchy issues of trade and Japanese financial support for its own defense did come up. There has been pressure on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to increase its military budget, and unhappiness over the $ 50 billion-plus <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's largest such imbalance. Before the meeting, a dozen senators wrote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressing worry about the jet fighter project. The letter, organized by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to resist pressure from the Japanese to support the project, and to undertake a full review of it before going forward.

Under the agreement, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> would join forces to build FSX jet fighters.

<TEXT>
 Officials from 22 African countries called on the continent's nations Friday to do more to save the lives of pregnant women, hundreds of thousands of whom die each year. More than 1,000 pregnant women die around the world each day from complications during pregnancy or childbirth, or from illegal abortions, according to a study by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund The study was the focus of a five-day conference of French-speaking African nations, which called the deaths the `` shame of modern times.'' `` What a woman loses life in giving life is as intolerable as it is unjust,'' a conference declaration said. About 450 pregnant women per 100,000 die each year in underdeveloped nations, including those in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, compared with 30 per 100,000 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Health ministers, doctors and representatives of <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> women's organizations were among the participants of the conference, which ended Friday The sponsors were <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. They said the conference was part of an effort to get Third World countries to devote more time and resources to saving the lives of pregnant women. A similar conference was held two years ago in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, for English-speaking African nations. Participants said <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> should try to reduce the number of women dying in childbirth by 50 percent in the next 25 years. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> studies, African women furnish 80 percent of the food their families eat. They gather firewood, carry water, plant gardens, prepare food, care for animals and look after children and the elderly. The women work at least 12 to 16 hours a day and experts on Third World development say they hold the key to helping nations struggling out of poverty. Yet African women also are the most vulnerable members of their society, said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaycox </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> vice president for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` When food is in short supply, she is the one who goes without, when there is no doctor, she is the one who must deal with the risks associated with frequent pregnancies,'' he told the conference. At least 63 percent of pregnant women in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> suffer from anemia and vitamin deficiencies that affect the health of their infant, according to a <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> report. More than 45 percent of the women deliver their children without medical help or midwives, the report said. Throughout <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, women also marry young and often have their first child before age 15. `` The major problem in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> today is preventing children from having children,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sai </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s population specialist `` And women of 45 or 50 who are having their eighth or ninth child are dying from it.''

 Just two months after visiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the first time, Soviet human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is planning a return trip, this time with his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, according to friends and family. The Sakharovs are to fly from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> next week. After five days in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, they plan to visit <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and then fly to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to see Mrs. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>'s children. Mrs. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Tatiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, said Friday the dates are still uncertain. Although both <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> have visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before, this will be their first trip together. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 67, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 for his defense of human rights. After speaking out against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> intervention in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979, he was exiled to the closed industrial city of <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> was banished there as well in 1984, and the couple remained in Gorky until Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> personally called them back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in December 1986. Although <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> generally has supported <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika, or political and economic restructuring, he has continued to express concern about political prisoners, the treatment of various ethnic groups and the steady accumulation of power in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s hands He received permission to visit the West last year. During the trip, Nov. 4 to Dec. 8, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> underwent a heart examination, met President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and visited <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in January 1986 for cardiac bypass surgery. While in the area, she and <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> have stayed with her daughter. In addition, they have visited with her son and daughter-in-law, <PERSON> Alexei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, and their children.

<HEAD>Court OKs EPA Agreements with Pesticide Makers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Friday upheld the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to make agreements with pesticide manufacturers permitting inventories to be used up after federal pesticide licenses are canceled. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON> had enjoined <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> from permitting <ORGANIZATION> Velsicol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the only manufacturer of chlordane and the related chemical heptachlor, from selling the chemicals under an agreement that included cancellation of the company's license. That September 1987, agreement provided that no more chlordane or heptachlor could be sold by <PERSON> Velsicol </PERSON> after April 15, 1988. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was concerned, however, that it might not be able to win agreements to end the use of other pesticides if <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON>'s decision stood. The chemicals have been used to drive termites away from the foundations of houses. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes the pesticides pose a high risk of cancer to people living in homes treated that way. <PERSON> Oberdorfer </PERSON> held that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> must examine the risks and benefits of using up existing stocks. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> maintained that it was not required to make such an examination because it was clear the agreement with <PERSON> Velsicol </PERSON> would result in a `` dramatic reduction'' in use, and less risk to the public, than any other course of action. The agency said it could not justify an emergency ban stopping all use immediately, and in any lesser proceeding to end use the manufacturer could continue to produce and sell the chemical, meaning that more would be introduced into the environment than would be the case if inventories were used up under the agreement. At the time of the agreement, inventories were estimated at 110,000 pounds, about a two months' supply.

<HEAD>Thousands Attend Funeral of Pro-Solidarity Priest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 150 Roman Catholic clergymen led thousands of mourners Friday in a funeral for a pro-Solidarity priest killed in a fire, and the union called for an independent inquiry into his death and that of another priest. The Rev. <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON>, 31, was buried in a small square near the <ORGANIZATION> Immaculate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION>, a provincial capital about 120 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. The city was home to <LOCATION> Suchowolec </LOCATION>. The service was celebrated by <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION> Bishop <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kisiel </PERSON> with assistance of 162 priests, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Koszewnik </PERSON>. Koszewnik estimated that more than 10,000 people gathered for the service. He said many carried banners from different chapters of the banned trade union Solidarity and the banned <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> `` We are parting with a great spokesman of Solidarity _ a man who was always closely linked to the working class and to those who struggle for human dignity,'' he quoted <PERSON> Kisiel </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Kisiel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cezary </PERSON> <PERSON> Potocki </PERSON>, chancellor of the church's <LOCATION> Bialystok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Curia </LOCATION>, acknowledged the death caused great concern among Polish Catholics. `` We hope that the concern will disappear when all the circumstances are cleared up,'' <PERSON> Koszewnik </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Potocki </PERSON> as saying. A fire caused by an electric stove Monday unleashed a cloud of smoke that claimed the life of <LOCATION> Suchowolec </LOCATION>, the second priest killed within 10 days. The Rev. <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, a Solidarity sympathizer who maintained a shrine to Poles killed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in World War II, died of a broken neck Jan. 21. The results of a prosecutor's investigation into what caused the stove fire have not been made public. Another investigation into the death of <PERSON> Niedzielak </PERSON> has not been finished. In a statement Friday, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> regional chapter of Solidarity expressed sorrow for the deaths and demanded that independent representatives be allowed to take part in the investigations. It said the results should be made public. Suchowolec actively supported Solidarity and organized pilgrimages to the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> gravesite of the Rev. <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON>, a popular pro-Solidarity priest murdered by security police in 1984. The young priest was buried next to a cross dedicated to <PERSON> Popieluszko </PERSON> that <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> had erected when he began to serve in the parish 2 -LCB- years ago, <PERSON> Koszewnik </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, a Solidarity member, brought a wreath and represented the union at the funeral. `` That man meant a lot to us,'' said his wife, <PERSON> Zofia </PERSON>, who also monitors human rights for Solidarity. She said <PERSON> Suchowolec </PERSON> had informed them that he was assaulted and that his car had been tampered with at least twice. He also said his parents' apartment was burned. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> urged the Polish government earlier this week to conduct a `` thorough and rapid'' investigation into the two deaths. The Polish government has said it had no evidence the deaths were politically motivated killings.

 Aerospace executive <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> has resurfaced seven years after abandoning his wife, two sons and the corporate life to become the vagabond beach bum his yuppie colleagues fantasized about. `` Anyone with any attachment to the human race could n't do what he did,'' said the wife he left behind. `` I will never forgive him for what he did to the boys.'' Although <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> was on the fast track at <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>, the young executive hated the white-collar, pinstripe world. On Sept. 10, 1981, he left without a word. `` I felt trapped. I did n't like my life,'' <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said Friday from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's something that is hard for me to imagine, even now, leaving and walking away from it all `` This was n't planned and certainly was n't rational.'' Before he disappeared, he told a co-worker: `` Never become too good at something you hate. They'll make you do it the rest of your life.'' The Greed. As for the pretty girls, `` Unfortunately, about the time you get to know them, they've gone back to <LOCATION> Muncie </LOCATION>.'' He got <PERSON> Hearn </PERSON>'s name, Social Security number and resume by placing a newspaper ad for an engineering job that the man answered. He said he filled in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents on those details when they caught him. Under an agreement with the government, he must stay out of trouble for a year or face charges in the case. Now, to an extent, he must face the past. The woman he left behind, <PERSON> Kit </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, is remarried and living somewhere in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after divorcing <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> in absentia, the Times said. She told him he could contact his sons, now 9 and 16. In addition to being fed-up with struggling up the corporate ladder, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said he left because there were pressures from his wife and from his father, whose offer of $ 100,000 for information about <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>'s whereabouts set private investigators scurrying across the country. Asked if he ever came close to calling his kids, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> said, `` Yes, many times.'' `` I just tried not to think about it,'' he said, adding he has written his sons but has n't talked to them or received a response. Is he happy with his new life? `` I'm certainly not satisfied. I'm happy now with the work I'm doing, but I would n't recommend doing this -LRB- disappearing -RRB- to anyone else. After he left, his former colleagues, some of whom said they wished they had the courage to do the same, began throwing annual parties, often showing up at them wearing <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> masks. <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, now 40, said he was n't aware of the celebrations, which attracted national media attention. If there's another, he wo n't make an appearance. As for his former co-workers, reactions include both relief and disappointment. `` I'm glad he's OK,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>'s former secretary who spoke with him by telephone on Thursday. `` But it is kind of disappointing that the mystery is gone. I'm not sure we can have any more parties unless we invite him. I'm not sure he would want to come.''

 Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> paid last respects to the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> on Friday, with ancient chants and prayers for reincarnation of the man who served as <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s top religious leader in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. About 800 monks lined up in the early morning outside the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s official residence in <LOCATION> Xigaze </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, according to the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. They filed by to view the body of the government loyalist and presented white silk scarves as a sign of respect. Other monks chanted ancient scriptures praising the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> and prayed for his early reincarnation, and tens of thousands of faithful paid homage to a photograph of the Panchen Lama in an adjoining hall. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who died of a heart attack Jan. 28 in <LOCATION> Xigaze </LOCATION>, was revered as a reincarnation of the <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> god <LOCATION> Amitabha </LOCATION>. He served as the main Tibetan spokesman for the Chinese government. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said his body would be preserved by being `` treated with precious medicines and bound with fine silks and satins, which will be changed regularly.'' It said `` golden powder'' will be painted on his face. The body will then be placed in a special shrine to be built in his honor at <LOCATION> Xigaze </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tashi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monastery </ORGANIZATION>, his religious seat. His predecessors also were preserved, but their funeral shrines were destroyed and their bodies dismembered by leftists during <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 1966-76 Cultural Revolution. A memorial service for the Panchen Lama also was held in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said It said hundreds of monks, nuns and local government attended. <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jintao </PERSON>, praised the Panchen Lama for playing `` an enormous and incomparable role'' in putting into effect party policies and managing <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>'s temples and monasteries `` under a socialist mantle.'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> also quoted <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> as urging Tibetans to honor the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s appeals and `` strive for a united, prosperous and culturally advanced new <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>.'' The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who ranked second in Tibetan Buddhism after the Dalai Lama, consistently supported Chinese rule in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. By contrast, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1959 after an abortive Tibetan uprising against <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> rule, has harshly criticized <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> repression and demanded freedom for his people. The Chinese communists occupied the fabled mountain land in 1950 as they consolidated national control after their revolution. The <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, who was educated by communists from age 11, criticized separatists without mentioning the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> by name. He denounced monks and lay Tibetans who held repeated anti-Chinese protests in <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> over the past year and a half. Three of those protests ended in violent clashes. However, the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> spoke out against harsh treatment of Tibetans and urged the government to promote Tibetans with talent, `` not simply lackeys.'' The official media has given heavy coverage to his death, recalling his support for Chinese rule in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>. Officials have refused to disclose funeral plans. It was not clear if Friday's ceremonies in <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION> were meant to serve that purpose. A ceremony is again likely when the body is placed in his shrine, which will take months to build.

<HEAD>Groups Urge More Public Review of Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two consumer watchdog groups said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should allow more public review of a proposal to overhaul federal inspection at meat and poultry processing plants. The Government Accountability Project and the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement filed with <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that the changes should have an adequate scientific basis and that `` swift and meaningful penalties'' should be imposed on processors who violate the rules. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> issued the proposal last November to carry out a 1986 law that would get tougher on inspections of the most troublesome processing plants but ease up on those with good records. The agency estimated that over time its inspection force would be reduced by half by retirements and resignations. The program would rely increasingly on `` good'' plants policing themselves. But the two organizations said the proposed rules fail meet the 1986 law's requirements and are `` unacceptably general and vague to the point where they only propose a structure for relaxing inspection, but not intensifying it where needed.'' Also, they charged, the agency's own evaluation of pilot projects using the proposed system showed serious deficiencies. `` The regulations were developed and drafted with no consultation with consumer or other public interest groups or inspectors'' the statement said. As proposed, the new rule would apply to plants that make frankfurters, beef stew, chicken soup, luncheon meats and scores of other processed items that include meat and poultry. The proposed rule would not apply to slaughter plants, which would remain under continuous federal inspection.

 After four days of questioning prospective jurors, the judge and lawyers in <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s Iran-Contra trial are learning that even in this news hub there are people who do n't give a darn about what's happening By the end of Friday's session, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had declared 24 women and eight men ignorant enough of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s 1987 congressional testimony to earn them a shot at being on the jury. Twenty did n't pass that muster. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had wanted a panel of 50 from which the jury of 12 and six alternates will be chosen, maybe next week. But Friday, he reduced that target to 45. The panel will consist only of those who persuade the judge and lawyers they did not watch <PERSON> North </PERSON> on television, hear him on the radio or read about him in newspapers and magazines. `` Have you heard of Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> asked a nurse's assistant `` No,'' she said. `` Have you read of Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON>?'' he asked. She said, no, she only read her horoscope. `` Does ` the Iran-Contra matter' carry any meaning for you?'' No, she said. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> dismissed the woman when she said she could not find the defendant guilty because `` I was n't there.'' A supervisor of banquet cleanup at a posh White House-area hotel said `` I'm the type of person who, once the news comes on, I switch it off.'' And when she was asked if she heard <PERSON> North </PERSON> testify on television, she said, `` with due respect to Colonel North, I found the conversation boring and walked away.'' To that, <PERSON> North </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> responded: `` He does n't mind at all. North, at the defense table, smiled. Those chosen Friday included a woman who said she does n't pay attention to news because it is `` depressing.'' `` I do n't like the news,'' she said. And when her mother, who does, turns it on, she said, `` I go to my room and lock my door.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> pressed her for her recollections of the six days in which <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified before the Iran-Contra investigative committees. At those joint hearings in the summer of 1987, the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel detailed many of the activities that are now charged to him as crimes. `` He was on TV all day long, on all morning, all afternoon and rerun at night,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` It made me mad, he was on all the channels,'' the woman said. `` I did not look at it at all. ... My mother probably did. I call her the ` news media,''' she said. One woman who publishes newsletters and the like said she was trying to get her business going at that time and `` by the time the day was over and the news came on I was out walking my dog.'' But she did know that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had a blonde secretary, <PERSON> Fawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a boss named -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, that he was a God-fearing man and that he had something to do with money and arms on an international scale. `` I know people either are for him or against him,'' said the woman whose office is on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. She was excused. A female military personnel clerk at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> qualified after testifying `` I hate bad news.'' A legal secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> did n't qualify because she saw the first few minutes of North's testimony before changing the channel.

<HEAD>Rupert Murdoch Takes Plunge In English Channels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Satellite television beams its way to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Sunday with much fanfare but few viewers. When media magnate <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> launches his four-channel Sky Television network, the number of channels available to most Britons will instantly double. But the equipment needed to receive the satellite signals in British homes is in short supply and will be for several more weeks, if not months. Only 5,000 to 20,000 homes will be equipped to tune in on Sunday, giving just a fraction of the 56 million Britons a chance to watch the 6 p.m. premiere. Watching television is <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s most popular leisure activity, even with only four regular channels: two commercial and two run by the state-funded <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Direct satellite-to-home television has been hailed as a revolution in British broadcasting, and the beginning of a new skirmish between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two biggest newspaper publishers, who both are trying to crack the satellite market. `` Time Out,'' the weekly guide to what's happening in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, has billed it `` the biggest aerial dogfight since the Battle of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'' and `` a no-holds barred Star Wars.'' Critics, praising the high-quality shows now produced in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, already have turned up their noses at <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s programming, which will rely heavily on imported American soap operas, situation comedies and game shows. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Grade </PERSON>, chief executive of the highbrow commercial Channel 4, called it `` junk, fast-food takeaway telly.'' Sky Television will be vying with a consortium involving rival publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, and a third international consortium, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- BSB -RRB-. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> has managed to get Sky on the air seven months before <ORGANIZATION> BSB </ORGANIZATION>'s target date. He's using the <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> satellite, owned by a Luxembourg-based group and put into orbit in December. <ORGANIZATION> BSB </ORGANIZATION> was awarded three of the five channels on another satellite under international treaty. That satellite is n't scheduled to be launched until August and programming is not expected until September. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s two channels, <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION> and Lifestyle, also will be bounced off the <ORGANIZATION> Astra </ORGANIZATION> satellite as soon as contractual snags are ironed out, said spokesman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Howland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s two channels and one of <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s now are available only to British cable subscribers. Cable subscribers have more channels than the regular four, but very fewer Britons have cable. It is available in only three of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s 32 boroughs, plus a handful of other cities.

<HEAD>Judge Blasts Contra Conspiracy Suit, Awards Defendants $1 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Friday criticized a guns-for-drugs conspiracy lawsuit against Contra and ex-CIA figures, calling it an abuse of the legal system and awarding the defendants $ 1 million in fees and costs. Chief U.S. District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> last June threw out the $ 24 million lawsuit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of journalists <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Honey </PERSON>. On Friday, King issued a follow-up ruling requiring the plaintiffs to pay the defendants $ 955,000 in attorney fees plus $ 79,500 in court costs. Some of the 29 defendants _ who include <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, ex-CIA deputy chief of operations <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON>, Iran-Contra figures <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, conservative activist former Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> and others _ promised action against the liberal, Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is the signal to begin the counterattack,'' <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said of King's action. `` I think this will put a damper on this kind of courthouse terrorism against those who are fighting against the radical left.'' <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said his attorneys would act quickly against the Christics to seize any assets to fulfill the judgment. <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> and Honey filed the suit in May 1986, before many of the revelations about the Iran-Contra affair. It grew from a 1984 bombing in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> apparently aimed at <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>. He escaped, but <PERSON> Avirgan </PERSON> was injured and eight people, including three journalists, were killed. The suit accused the defendants of setting up the bombing, as well as working with drug traffickers in a 30-year right-wing conspiracy that included anti-communist activities in <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other locations. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shackley </PERSON> said he will `` try to keep the spotlight of public scrutiny'' on the group and intends to continue his campaign to drive the Christics out of business. The <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> bitterly criticized the ruling by <PERSON> King </PERSON>, noting that their appeal of his decision last June was still before the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. They also are appealing Friday's ruling, seeking an immediate stay. `` Judge King's decision was a legal disgrace,'' said Christic attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, who assembled much of the case. `` His ruling will only strengthen our position in the appeals court that Judge King is committing a consistent pattern of legal error.'' <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> noted that while King criticized the suit as having no legal merit, three of the defendants _ <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Civilian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Materiel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Assistance </LOCATION> head <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON> _ are under federal indictment on related charges. Another defendant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, has been arrested by Costa Rican authorities on drug - and gun-running charges `` The <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations ... were based on unsubstantiated rumor and speculation from unidentified sources with no first-hand knowledge,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said in the ruling. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, an attorney for three of the defendants, said the case could now be `` consigned to the oblivion it richly deserves.'' Asked what he planned to do with his share of the money, <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> joked: `` Buy guns for the Contras.''

 <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, a star of the `` Diff ` rent Strokes'' television show, was held for investigation of attempted murder Friday, just days after a drug possession Bridges, 23, and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON>, 30, were arrested late Thursday at a residence a block from a vacant house linked to narcotics activity where <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> was shot five times and stabbed, said Sgt. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Tantee </PERSON>. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> was in critical but stable condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center. Police had no other details about the victim, including his age or residence. <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON> was also held for investigation of attempted murder. Police said Bridges was arrested at the same vacant house Jan. 25 for investigation of possession of cocaine. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said that case was rejected but the file was not immediately available to determine why. Bridges, best known for his role as <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s older brother on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Diff ` rent Strokes'' from 1978 to 1985, has had several brushes with the law, including a no-contest plea to making a bomb threat several years <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> told police he confronted Bridges and <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON> late Thursday in the vacant house after an unidentified person told him someone was breaking in. An argument ensued and Bridges allegedly pulled a gun and shot Clay five times, and <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON> allegedly slashed <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> with the knife, <PERSON> Tantee </PERSON> said. After Bridges and <PERSON> Duckett </PERSON> were taken into custody, a .22 - caliber handgun and a shotgun were seized shortly afterward at the arrest site, <PERSON> Tantee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tantee </PERSON> said police reports note that the house where <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> was shot was the site of `` numerous calls over the past few weeks regarding narcotics.'' In 1983 Bridges paid a $ 240 fine after being arrested for carrying a concealed firearm. He received a suspended sentence in January 1987 after pleading no contest to a charge of making a bomb threat that stemmed from the bombing of an auto customizer's car during a dispute over work on the actor's Porsche. Bridges also appeared in court in January 1988 to answer a reckless driving complaint in which police said he was driving about 80 mph in a 35-mph zone in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> students pelted administrators with marshmallows Friday to protest the cancellation of the 1989 Beaux Arts Ball over concerns about drinking by minors. `` We're getting a lot of fluff from them so they are getting it back,'' said <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, a fine arts student who helped organize the protest. The ball, scheduled March 11, has been held every four years for the past 80 years, students said. Students and alumni dress in elaborate costumes and drink and revel all night. The ball `` has a history of being a pull-out-the-stops party that starts at 9 p.m. and last all night,'' said <PERSON> Braden </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, dean of student affairs. The Fine Arts Building sustained $ 50,000 in damage during the 1985 ball, he said. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said he canceled the ball because none of the student organizers could assure him that minors would not be allowed to drink alcohol and that university property would not be damaged. Word reached students Thursday, and about 70 of them stood in a cold rain Friday morning outside the administration building, carrying signs and throwing marshmallows at administrators as they entered.

 Balmy southern breezes gave way Friday to frigid north wind, but raucous <LOCATION> Mardi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gras </LOCATION> revelry continued building to a fever pitch, including preparations for the nearly nude French Quarter fashion show. With <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON> less than five days away, maskers made ready to roll on the elaborate floats of 40 metropolitan parades. Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> said the freezing temperatures predicted for the weekend were unlikely to stop the fun. `` Snow, sleet, ice, or 80 mile an hour winds. Those are the only things that would stop a parade,'' said <PERSON> Holman </PERSON>. `` Cold weather does n't dampen many spirits, but it may cause people to drink more of them.'' Each year on <PERSON> Mardi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> sponsors `` The Bourbon Street Awards,'' a costume contest in which many of the participants are male cross-dressers _ or undressers. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> said hundreds of people turn out each year in everything from elaborate creations of beads and feathers to barely legal outfits. Thousands more are there to watch and he does n't expect this year to be any different, in spite of the weather. `` People work all year on their costumes. They are n't about to cover it up or not wear it just because it gets cold,'' he said. <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> agreed that the chill probably wo n't do much to tone down the French Quarter celebration or cover up the celebrants. `` Mardi Gras day even if it's 30 degrees as predicted, you'll see people, not nude, but pretty close to it,'' he said.

 Top House Democrats, leading their members to a weekend retreat at the luxurious <LOCATION> Greenbrier </LOCATION> resort, tried to put the onus on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Friday as they faced heat over Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s plan to let a 51 percent congressional pay raise take effect, at least temporarily, next week. But many lawmakers doubted <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s gambit _ letting the raise automatically go through and then having the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote to cut it back to 30 percent _ would end public demand for rescinding the entire $ 45,500 pay increase. Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip, told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 95-5 vote Thursday to reject the pay raise was an easy one that left the difficult decision to the House. `` We intend to send that -LRB- 30 percent increase -RRB- over to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, those folks over there who are very strong willed, and we'll stand up and see what they do and see if they're interested in a 50 percent increase or not,'' he said `` We're taking the heat and they're not,'' he said, defending the need for a pay increase or some sort. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic organization, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was `` wanting it both ways _ keeping honoraria and after-hours -LRB- earnings -RRB- while appearing to be pure on the pay raise. The pay raise, which would increase rank-and-file congressional salaries from $ 89,500 to $ 135,000, takes effect Wednesday unless the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> joins the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before then in voting to kill it. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, a group of Republicans were planning to force a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote Monday on the pay raise. The group planned to offer a resolution calling on <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to hold a vote on the pay raise before it goes into effect. The draft resolution asserted that `` the dignity of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> is being sullied from coast to coast'' because of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s failure to schedule a vote. If the leadership declines to allow an immediate vote on the resolution, proponents would call for a vote to override the ruling and seek to construe that vote, which could be forced without majority approval, as a test vote on the pay increase, according to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> aides. The move is being led by Reps. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannemeyer </PERSON>, R-Calif. On the train ride here, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders and aides worked to explain <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s decision, which blocks a vote before the raise takes effect Many of the 142 House Democrats, accompanied by their families to the resort, wondered aloud whether the speaker's strategy, which could keep the pay fight going for weeks or months, was wise. `` The opponents of the pay raise will try a repeal every two weeks until Christmas eve,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont. `` I have never received such vicious mail,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. He said constituents were promising to vote against him even if the pay raise took effect over his objections. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said he understood <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s position, but said `` it will not help because 30 percent and 50 percent are still viewed as excessive and the public does n't understand honorariums.'' Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., who has been working with the bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership on the pay issue and a companion measure to ban members from taking speaking fees or other honoraria, declined to criticize the speaker's plan but said he doubted it would defuse the situation The issue caters to `` trash television and talk radio. If they had their way, this wuld go on for months,'' he said. `` It could become a far more dominant issue than it has been already,'' he said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he thought <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s plan would still be seen as a way to protect a raise while the public wanted none. `` And the 50 percent will be repealed,'' he predicted. The lawmakers were reminded of the public outcry at the outset of their trip, as their buses arrived at the side door of Union Station to avoid a protest. And along the way, a prominent trackside sign read: `` Spike the Pay Hike.'' Privately, members also worried that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s strategy would not only fail to net them a pay raise, but cost them their income from honoria as well. The ban on accepting those fees would go into effect immediately in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and if the pay raise were rolled back it would be politically embarassing to then repeal the honoraria ban. Speaker <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s second-ranked Democrat, Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., were not on the train because of a White House meeting Friday morning They were flying to the resort later Friday to join their colleagues for the weekend.

His temporary license still entitles <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> to teach in other city public schools, but he said: `` I just want to work in a place that I think of as my home.'' <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION> said he chose to teach with a temporary license because it meant he could take acting jobs. He has appeared in eight movies. `` If he wants the freedom to be an actor, it is to his advantage to be a temporary employee,'' said <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>. `` With that he is accepting the risk.

He said the district superintendent, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, had wanted a permanent license holder who would not leave when an acting job came up.

<HEAD>U.N. Group Reports 400 `Disappearances' In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 400 people were reported missing last year in new cases of `` enforced or involuntary disappearances,'' mostly in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said Friday. It said the number of cases nearly doubled compared to 1987, and the number of countries where disappearances were reported also rose. Most of the alleged disappearances, reported by human rights groups, were linked to a country's authorities. The report, compiled by a five-member working group for the current annual session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, cited evidence of disappearances in 15 of the 44 countries examined. It voiced special concern about disappearances of women and children, but gave no breakdown. The working group asked the governments concerned for comment on the latest cases, but most of them remain unresolved, the report said. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s 170 cases topped the list of alleged disappearances reported last year. Also figuring prominently were <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> with 70 people reported missing, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, 53; <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, 40; and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, 39. It said <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> had the largest number of outstanding cases, 3,387, but it noted no disappearances have been reported there since 1983. The report said disappearances increased in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> because of the government's fight against two guerrilla groups, Shining Path and <ORGANIZATION> MRTA </ORGANIZATION>, and its imposition of a state of emergency and military administration in about 30 provinces. It quoted people who `` reappeared'' after arrest as implicating Peruvian army, police and security forces. In <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, evidence indicates that disappearances have continued despite recent democratic government elections, the report said. Peasants, religious activists and clergymen, and trade union leaders were most often reported abducted or arrested. The report blamed soldiers, members of paramilitary groups or security services, and armed men in civilian clothes. Most of those reported missing in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> are young men in rural areas who were arrested as part of the government's fight against the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, the report said. Laws in most of the countries investigated are inadequate for quickly determining the whereabouts of disappeared people, the report said. The working group, chaired by <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> expert <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tosevski </PERSON>, appealed to governments for sparing use of emergency powers in times of civil conflict. It criticized <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Seychelles </LOCATION> for failing to reply to allegations of disappearances. The working group said it has compiled evidence of about 17,000 enforced disappearances since it began issuing annual reports in 1980. A separate report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission's special investigator on religious intolerance Friday singled out positive developments in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It cited large imports of Bibles for the commemoration of 1,000 years of Christianity in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, early release or reduced prison sentences for jailed believers and moves toward legal reform. But the report said the worldwide persistence of many different forms of religious discrimination, often by governments, `` hardly inspires optimism.''

<HEAD>Lujan Says Interior Still Backs Alaska Refuge Oil Exploration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to stick with its recommendation that a vast wildlife refuge in northeastern <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> be opened for gas and oil exploration, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said Friday. Environmentalists have said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's actions on development of the 1.5 million acre coastal stretch of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> will be a test of the administration's intentions toward environmental issues Asked about the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> refuge during his first news conference after being sworn in as <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary earlier in the day, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> replied that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has said we should explore -LRB- the refuge -RRB- in an environmentally acceptable manner'' and the question `` is out of my domain.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must approve any such oil exploration, and legislation has been introduced in both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would open the refuge for drilling. But other legislation also has been introduced that would make the refuge a wilderness area protected from exploration. The oil industry for years has been pushing for access to the refuge's northern coastal plain where there are indications of large oil and gas deposits. In the final days of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> sent a recommendation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> endorsing development. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> had sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a formal assessment that drilling would not cause undue harm to the environment. A dozen environmental groups, including some of the country's largest, last month urged in letters to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> review its findings, contending the conclusions were based on incomplete or false research <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> told reporters Friday he was not aware of the petition from the environmental groups and said of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier recommendation to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` I do n't think I can pull it back.'' He said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made it clear he favors oil and gas exploration as long as it is acceptable environmentally. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> declined to suggest how the refuge might be opened for exploration and suggested he favors approaching that slowly. `` Should we open -LRB- the refuge -RRB- up in an environmentally acceptable manner? That decision has been made,'' he said, alluding to the president's previously proclaimed position. He emphasized that no development in the refuge can proceed without congressional action. Environmentalists and conservationists including the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> have vowed to fight any drilling in the refuge, which is home for the Porcupine caribou, polar bears and millions of birds. On other subjects during his news conference, <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said: _ He has recommended abandonment of a proposal suggested by his predecessor that firefighting on federal lands be paid for partly from funds that now go to the states from lumber and mineral lease receipts. _ He opposes selling oil shale development rights on public lands for $ 2.50 an acre as <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> has proposed, saying that's too little. _ He plans in coming days to visit the Trust Territory islands in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, over which <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> has jurisdiction, as well as tour a number of schools run by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in the West. _ He intends to develop a strong anti-drug program aimed at eradicating illegal marijuana growing on public lands, including increased use of aircraft used by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A federal court this week ordered a halt to random drug testing of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees.

After an arctic cold front chilled most of the state, temperatures dipped to below 4 degrees and the 4-inch steel pipe that delivers natural gas to the town of 2,200 contracted and pulled apart, said officials of <ORGANIZATION> Lone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, owner of the pipeline. Almost two-thirds of the town's homes and businesses were without gas for heating, hot water or cooking, and schools were closed for the day. `` Boy, was it cold,'' said <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, a janitor at the <ORGANIZATION> Cottle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't think I would have made it without my electric blanket.'' No injuries were reported either as a result of the break or the cold, said officials. The pipeline broke about 3 a.m. in an isolated area of ranchland, said LSG regional superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. Fire Chief <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON> sounded a fire alarm about 4:15 a.m. to warn residents, and he and other volunteers began rounding up electric space heaters to take to the elderly. `` I scared everbody to death blowing the whistle,'' he said. `` But we needed to warn'em.'' Space heaters were taken to the Wood Convalescent Home, where 44 people live. Nurses gathered ambulatory residents together in the hall and draped bedspreads over windows for insulation, said nursing home director <PERSON> Gwynna </PERSON> <PERSON> Stofel </PERSON>. `` Luckily it never got below 68 in here,'' she said. `` We used hot plates to serve a warm breakfast.'' The nursing home was the first place in town to have its service restored, at about 11 a.m. after the break was repaired. Gas crews then went to work restoring heat to the homes of the elderly, said <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>. Others had to wait until late afternoon and early evening. The cold sparked a run on $ 14 electric space heaters at <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said office manager <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walling </PERSON>. `` We brought them in from all the offices around and we sold those so they had to bring more all the way from <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>,'' she said, adding that more than 50 had been sold by early afternoon. Some people gathered on the town square at the senior citizens' center, which has electric heat, stoves and ovens and served a warm breakfast to about 125 residents, said center director <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> Restaurant owners <PERSON> Willa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Isbell </PERSON>, lacking gas to fire their stoves, took food from their steakhouse to feed the hungry and cold. `` Is n't it wonderful how a little town just rises up and pitches in when something like this happens,'' said <PERSON> Geneva </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, who ventured out in the cold early to unlock the electric-heated <LOCATION> Cottle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> courthouse so `` people would have someplace warm to go.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> airlift will begin flying food and medical supplies in a few days to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, the besieged capital of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, officials announced Friday. <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> is surrounded by Moslem guerrillas who have attacked supply convoys as the last Soviet soldiers withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Soviet aircraft have been flying in emergency rations of flour and fuel to relieve severe shortages. `` This is one of many actions of Operation Salaam,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief campaign for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> said. `` It's all in the effort to assist in the reconstruction of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials could not give an exact date for the airlift to begin. The <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport was closed Monday because of heavy snow. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters said by telephone, on condition of anonymity, that Afghan guerrillas have agreed in principle not to attack <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> planes carrying relief supplies to the 2 million residents and refugees of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. In return, they said, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> would send more relief aid into regions the insurgents control. Until last week, the guerrillas had threatened to attack <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flights or truck convoys on grounds that providing aid to <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> would help the Soviet-sponsored government. Insurgent leaders have predicted <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other cities will fall quickly after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is gone, without the need for major guerrilla assaults. Moslem guerrillas have fought since a Communist coup 11 years ago. Soviet soldiers entered the country in December 1979, increasing in number to an estimated 115,000 by last May 15, when they began withdrawing under a U.N.-negotiated agreement. All are to be gone by Feb. 15. `` Airlifts have not started, but it is not the only action that is being taken,'' Ms. <PERSON> Younes </PERSON> said. Her comment that the airlift was part of `` an overall action'' tacitly confirmed supplies would be provided to both <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and guerrilla areas. `` There have been contacts all along with all the parties,'' she said. Government forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> generally are confined to the cities, and insurgents control the countryside. <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Operation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salaam </ORGANIZATION>, was beginning a week of consultations with the insurgents and other parties to the conflict. Operation Salaam, which means `` peace'' in Arabic, plans to spend more than $ 1.1 billion over two years in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Its objectives include clearing the nation of mines, repatriating more than 5 million refugees from neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and reviving the primarily agricultural economy. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has pledged $ 600 million of the $ 887.6 million promised so far. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, principal arms supplier to the guerrillas, pledged $ 16.7 million. Much of the Soviet aid will consist of food, clothing, bedding, medical supplies and cloth, with no restrictions on where it may be distributed, the Operation Salaam office said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> congratulated the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers on Friday and said they `` rewrote the record books'' with their Super Bowl victory. In turn he was presented with two autographed balls and a jogging outfit. `` Let me congratulate you also on your victory,'' quarterback <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Montana </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at a East Room reception. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> said being invited to the White House `` means a lot to all of us'' and joked: `` Not very often do I get to see these guys in ties.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, surrounded by 49ers, told the team, `` With this, your third Super Bowl title in eight years, you rewrote the record books and raised the game of football to a new level of excellence.'' And, to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, who drove the team to the winning touchdown on a 92-yard drive late in the fourth quarter, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, you once again showed your grace under pressure. I guess we all wonder why it took so long.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was presented autographed balls by both <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and wide receiver <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, who won the game's Most Valuable Player award. `` That's the real thing from the Super Bowl,'' <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said of the ball he gave the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked that he heard, `` there is a new TV series coming out based on your Super Bowl performance _ <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rice </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Aide Says Nixon Would Use Extra Pension Money to Pay for Security</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If a pay raise that would increase pensions of former presidents becomes law, former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> will use the additional money to pay for security for himself and his wife, a spokesman said Friday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, assistant to the former president, wrote on <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s behalf to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxpayers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, who had written to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> urging him to publicly oppose the pay increase. The pay raise proposal, approved by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, calls for increasing the salaries of members of the Cabinet to $ 155,000 from $ 99,500. Since a 1971 law links presidential pensions to Cabinet salaries, the pensions of all former presidents would be increased by the same amount. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> on Jan. 17: `` In view of your recent public statements urging the new administration and the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to control the federal budget deficit, I hope that you will publicly issue a statement urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reject the increase and saying that you will refuse to accept a 56 percent pension increase.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> noted in his reply that former first lady <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> relinquished her right to <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection in 1983 and the former president did so the following year. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nixons </ORGANIZATION> are now paying for their own security, an expense of over $ 500,000 since 1985,'' he said. `` It is RN's intention to apply whatever increase may be enacted in his pension entirely toward defraying the cost of his and Mrs. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s security.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> that the <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> <PERSON> Library </PERSON> and Birthplace, now under construction at <LOCATION> Yorba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, would be the first such facility to be both built and operated without expenditure of public funds. `` In sum, I am sure you will agree that by his decisions regarding <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> protection and private funding for the operation of his library and birthplace, President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has already demonstrated extraordinary leadership on the deficit issue,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The pay raises automatically go into effect unless they are disapproved by both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before Wednesday. House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, however, has proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote Thursday on a proposal that would scale the increases back, both for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and for Cabinet officers and other executive branch officials. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> released the correspondence from <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Woodcliff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday asked <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> to explain the `` rationale and justification'' for his proposal to change the two-decades-old system that regulates <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s long-distance rates. A letter from committee chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>, and telecommunications and finance subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., urged <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> to submit a detailed description of the plan, which <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> revised after failing to sell it on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> last year <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> acknowledged congressional concern about the price cap proposal last week when he postponed a commission vote on the plan until March 16. `` We are pleased that you have agreed to a procedure that will permit the public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to review the details of the price cap plan,'' said the letter, which also was signed by Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lent </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rinaldo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the ranking Republicans on the committee and subcommittee, respectively. It added: `` We also would appreciate your explanation of the rationale and justification for adopting this price cap plan.'' <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Peratino </PERSON> said the commission would have no immediate comment on the letter. A committee aide who asked that her name not be used said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> would be invited to testify at a Feb. 28 subcommittee hearing. Since the early 1960s, the government has allowed <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T a certain profit beyond its costs. But the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> proposed replacing this so-called rate-of-return regulation for dominant carriers such as <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and the regional <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies with ceilings on prices. The commission proposed to let <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> raise rates 3 percent less than annual inflation _ a move it said would would encourage greater efficiency and innovation and save customers $ 1.6 billion over four years if all the dominant companies participated. AT & amp; T officials have applauded the plan as being a long-overdue concession to changing economies in the telephone industry. But lawmakers said the plan did n't guarantee that <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s rates would remain in a `` zone of reasonableness.'' The letter Friday asked <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> to `` outline how the price cap plan will benefit residential consumers, business users and rural telephone subscribers. Please specify both the safeguards proposed to prevent the dominant carriers from engaging in anti-competitive practices and assess the role of competition in determining the applicability of the price cap plan in each segment of the market.'' It asked for computer models and analyses used to derive the proposal, including `` any analyses of the impact of price caps on residential and business consumers, and a comparison of how consumers would fare under prices caps and under the current rate-of-return regulation. Please include the origin of the starting rate that you propose to adopt for each element of service, and the method of adjustment proposed for each -LRB- element -RRB-.''

<TEXT>
 Representatives of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have held secret talks about improving relations and discussed the possibility of a meeting between their leaders, newspaper reports said Friday. Two days before the reports, an unprecedented trade agreement was announced between the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> and communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> said Friday the agreement could open the way to reunification after 44 years. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper reports quoted a government source, who was not identified, as saying the secret talks were held abroad and covered most major issues between the rival Koreas. They said the most recent meetings were in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> during the past week between Park Chul-un, a special secretary to President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, and a senior North Korean official who was not identified. Park met with the North Korean several times to discuss major issues, including a proposed summit, the reports said. The government source was quoted as saying the summit could be held this year. Last month, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> renewed a proposal that he and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> discuss the future of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, which was divided in 1945. The reported talks coincided with the historic visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of a leading South Korean industrialist to discuss direct investment and joint venture projects. <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju-yung </PERSON>, founder and honorary chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>, was in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from Jan. 23 to Feb. 1 as a guest of the communist government. He said Thursday he had agreed with North Korean officials to undertake several joint ventures in the North, including a shipyard, railroad plant and tourist resort. Newspapers quoted unidentified government officials as saying tours would be available later this year to the resort area, a rugged scenic region 20 miles north of the eastern boundary of the demilitarized zone that divides the peninsula. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s government said it would propose special legislation to facilitate the projects. Contact with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is a violation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s national security laws. The two nations are technically still at war because no peace treaty was signed when the three-year Korean war ended 1953. In a statement Friday, the government said it `` in principle takes a favorable view of the proposed projects, regarding them as possible pilot projects that could contribute to efforts to achieve national unification.'' <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> was believed to be the first <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> business leader approved by both governments to visit the North. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s participation in the deal is seen as an attempt to revive its economy. It is reported to owe $ 5 billion to Soviet bloc and Western nations. Figures published Friday and attributed to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government said <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had a trade deficit of $ 720 million in 1987. Exports were given as $ 1.67 billion and imports as $ 2.39 billion.

<TEXT>
 A British woman who fled from an outlawed guerrilla group last year was actually a South African police officer assigned to spy on the anti-apartheid movement, the government said Friday. <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, 28, was held captive by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for 22 months before she fled in May to the British Embassy in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. She holed up in the embassy for six months before returning here. Until Friday, neither she nor South African police would comment on the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' allegation that she was a spy who had tried to infiltrate the guerrilla movement. Her father, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, had insisted she was a journalist. The head of the police security branch, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Basie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smit </PERSON>, said in a statement that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> was a police lieutenant who gathered `` valuable information'' after pretending to defect to the guerrilla group in 1986. <PERSON> Smit </PERSON> said she was tortured at an <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> camp in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smit </PERSON> also identified another police spy, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnden </PERSON>, who infiltrated leading anti-apartheid organizations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> such as the Black Sash civil rights group and the End Conscription Campaign. Both women, who are white, `` performed a great duty for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> ... in exceptionally dangerous circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Smit </PERSON>. He said details of their missions were being disclosed to counter a `` twisted account'' that might come from the guerrilla organization. Police released a lengthy statement by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON>, who holds British and South African citizenship. In the statement, she said she was beaten while in custody and said the group's exiled leadership did not want their leader, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, released from prison in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because they felt he was more useful as a martyr. She also said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, was an `` embarrassment'' to the group because she `` never does as she is instructed.'' She also asserted that a leadership struggle between two young guerrilla leaders, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thabo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, was likely whenever president <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> stepped down. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>, an African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> spokesman based in <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, denied a leadership split and said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> and not been mistreated while in custody. He said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should take away her British passport because she had spied for another country. Regarding morale problems within the group, <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> said it was possible there had been shortages of food and supplies in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Students, one of the anti-apartheid organizations that Miss <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> infiltrated at <ORGANIZATION> Rhodes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement saying Miss <PERSON> Forsyth </PERSON> was believed to have caused the detention of at least four human rights activists whom she pretended to befriend while at the school. The African National Congress was outlawed by the South African government in 1960 and began a bombing and sabotage campaign in 1961 aimed at undermining the white-minority government.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, two independent newspapers read by the military and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, are calling on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to withdraw from consideration as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, citing recent allegations about his personal life and past ties to defense contractors. `` Out of concern for the military, which the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator clearly loves, he should step aside,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> writes in an editorial to be published in Monday's edition of <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The 49-year-old, independent publication has a worldwide circulation of about 125,000, including most of the uniformed military. `` Tower's public position has been so compromised by the agonizing process by which he was nominated and is being confirmed ... that he can not be the strong spokesman the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> needs now,'' the editorial said. `` More troubling and more at issue is Tower's position as a consultant to defense contractors. ... the speed and greed with which Tower spun through the revolving door is appalling,'' it said. The editorial suggests that either President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is concerned about ethics in government, reconsider Tower's appointment, or that the former senator `` summon personal courage of his own ... it might be the best help he can give to his friends in the military. Defense News, in an editorial for Monday written by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, says Tower's withdrawal `` would be the act of a seasoned politician who understands that the best interests of the nation sometimes require personal sacrifice by those who would help lead it.'' `` Withdrawal is necessary because the record of Mr. <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s professional life raises substantive doubt that he can perform with utmost effectiveness at a time when defense priorities and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> each are undergoing periods of vital but delicate change,'' the editorial said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> is a three-year-old independent publication with a circulation of about 30,000, including the top level of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and defense industry, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Defense News suggests that Tower links to defense consultants is the most troubling aspect of the recent confirmation process. `` The principal task of the next <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary is to build public confidence that the Pentagon is being well-managed and that defense dollars are being carefully spent,'' the editorial said. `` The defense secretary must be an independent voice of force, authority and reason. `` There is ample reason to doubt whether Mr. <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is the man for these times,'' the editorial said. Tower, in his testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he had received more than $ 1 million in fees for defense consulting over a 2 -LCB- year period. He said he had severed all ties with the consultants as of Dec. 1, 1988.

<TEXT>
 Parliament opened on Friday without President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but his temporary replacement echoed the ailing leader's commitment to segregation and cautious social reforms. Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>, appointed acting president after <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered a stroke Jan. 18, promised `` full civil rights for all South Africans'' in a speech to lawmakers. But he said racial segregation laws would remain in place and announced no major new initiatives. <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> also reiterated the government's call for political negotiations with black leaders, although virtually all prominent blacks have refused to talk without signs of additional race reforms. <PERSON> Zach </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON>, leader of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said afterward that <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> `` merely repeated platitudes and generalities offered in the past.''

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday that guns scare her and she does n't own one because `` I'm too afraid I'd shoot the wrong person.'' She said military assault rifles like the one used in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> rampage that left five children dead should be outlawed. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the first lady said she did not want to discuss the `` politics and policies'' surrounding handgun ownership. Her husband, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, opposes new federal handgun controls and is a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` I myself do not own a gun,'' she said, urging an interviewer to talk with her husband about his position on handguns. `` I choose not to get into that. I am afraid of them -LRB- guns -RRB-. I'm too afraid I'd shoot the wrong person. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, before moving to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> eight years ago, revealed she had owned `` a tiny little gun'' that she kept by her bed for protection while husband was away. In her first White House interview in 1981, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said she had gotten rid of the weapon. Marking the end of her second week in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spent part of Friday afternoon giving her first interviews since her husband became president. `` I feel at home here,'' she said, sitting on a couch, bathed in light from an arched window behind her. In a town torn by debate over a 51 percent pay increase for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if she had been able to live on her husband's salary when he was a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> in the 1960s. `` No,'' she replied, saying that they had relied on money he earned as an oilman in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Could we have lived on it? We probably could have,'' she said. However, she said, they would have had a very different lifestyle and would not have been able to maintain two homes or send their children to private schools. Asked if her husband had changed in any way since becoming president, she replied, `` I do n't see a difference with him.'' Pointing to several people in the room, she said, `` I see a difference in you and you and you. Not me. I mean it's just different when you're president. Everybody treats you differently when you're president.'' Joking about her husband's former status as vice president, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I spend half my life saying, ` Could you please get the vice president on the phone?' and the operator says, ` Do you really want <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' or ` Do n't you know <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.''' More seriously, she said, one big difference for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is that `` everything you say becomes major, and it is major. He is the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' And yet, she said of her husband: `` I think he's exactly the same.'' She said many people who used to kid with her husband had stopped doing that briefly but `` after awhile they all became normal again. It just took a little while. ... `` I call him Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON> sometimes _ when I'm needling him ... to tease him, ` Yes, Mr. President.''' The first lady was asked whether she favored enactment of laws banning sale to the public of military assault guns. Measures to outlaw the manufacture, sale or possession of a variety of rifles are pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and dozens of states. It was a Chinese AK-47 assault rifle that a gunman used in the rampage in which five children were killed and 29 others, as well as a teacher, were wounded in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> last month. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she thought such weapons already were outlawed. `` They should be, absolutely,'' she said. While refusing to discuss her position on handguns, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that she does not like to go hunting, as does her husband, an avid outdoorsman. `` I went hunting with <PERSON> George </PERSON> once,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled. `` He told me to follow the bird, and I followed the bird and his head came right through that little circle -LRB- the rifle scope -RRB-. I put down the gun and said, ` That's it. I'm not going to do that again.''' Earlier Friday, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> and praised the center's staff of volunteers `` It reinforces my belief that we have got to help the working poor,'' she told reporters during her 40-minute visit. The first lady helped carry from the trunk of her limousine seven plastic bags full of clothes and toys that she and members of the White House staff donated. The center is a private, non-profit organization whose programs include a thrift shop, food pantry, medical clinics, day care, counseling and financial assistance. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> posed for photographers with four children from the facility's day care center. They included 4-year-old <PERSON> Amber </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, who handed Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a `` mock voting tally'' from the preschool class, showing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with a clear margin over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` That just makes me feel wonderful,'' the first lady said.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Friday called for improvements in human rights conditions in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, saying future <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Central American nation is tied to such efforts. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also said during a one-day stop here that if President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> agrees to a request by the leftist rebels to postpone the country's March 19 election, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will back him. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, in a luncheon toast honoring <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Thursday, called the rebels' election plan a step in the right direction `` because for the first time they expected there exists an electoral alternative.'' The rebels said they would recognize the election under certain conditions, including postponement until September. After praising <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> as a champion of human rights during his five-year term, which is coming to a close, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` Now as we approach elections there has been more violence ... on both the left and the right.'' `` Why I am here today is to reiterate in the strongest terms possible our commitment to democracy and the advancement of human rights,'' he told reporters in a news conference at the home of Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` There are consequences to human rights violations in the future,'' he added, then he left to privately address military leaders on the human rights issue. `` We, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are committed to the process and the system of democracy. Democracy means human rights and decency,'' he said. `` Our commitment and our support is conditioned on this process and this system.'' One day earlier, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had taken strong issue with former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s comment that the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration should rely on `` economic pressure'' to further the cause of human rights in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. At the White House Friday, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s comment on <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, `` The vice president is free to say whatever he wants to say. I think the vice president's a pretty astute fellow.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Friday he would speak in direct, emphatic and specific terms to the military leaders, who have been accused of failing to adequately curb human rights violations. He compared his planned comments to those of then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who in 1983 told the Salvadorans that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid would dry up if the human rights situation did not improve. A senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who attended the meeting said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told the military leaders the congressional consensus behind aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> was `` of necessity a fragile thing and that sliding back on the human rights question would threaten it.'' The official commented only on condition he not be named. The vice president's visit came against a backdrop of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s presidential campaign and maneuvering over how to deal with the peace proposal offered by the rebels last week. `` If President <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> announces a consensus within the constitutional framework, I am sure there would be strong support from the administration'' on postponement of the election, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in the strongest statement to date by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official on the peace proposal. The proposal by the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, is `` a step forward,'' he said. He said that was why <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, after an initial negative reaction, did not reject it outright. `` But now it is incumbent for reciprocity from the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>, reciprocity to cease fire now,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> met Friday also with political leaders and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Archbishop <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> y Damas, an intermediary in carrying the rebels' peace proposal to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The political delegation that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> saw included presidential candidates <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> d'Aubuisson </PERSON>, who has long faced allegations of involvement with right-wing death squads, was not invited to the meeting. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also chose not to meet with a third, trailing presidential candidate, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungo </PERSON>, of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convergence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, which is closely allied with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the left was passed over because `` we feel it is inappropriate because we do not know how serious the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is with this proposal.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> initially blasted the Jan. 23 proposal as unconstitutional because it called for changing the constitutionally mandated March election. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials felt the proposal was worth examining because of the rebels' first-ever offer to join in elections without demanding power-sharing as a precondition. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has provided more than $ 3 billion in aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> this decade. The early 1980s were marked by many killings of civilians, and soldiers and right-wing death squads were blamed. After 1984, human rights violations seemed to decrease, but violence by both left and right has picked up again in the last year. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was under heavy security during his visit. The press corps in the motorcade behind his bulletproof limousine rode in vans customized against attack.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> declined Friday to intervene in a suit charging that <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> billed the Pentagon for more than $ 10 million in fraudulent charges. The department's decision not to intervene in the case at this point indicated it had legal reservations about the complaint by current and former workers at the company's <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, aerospace plant. The complaint, filed last year in federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, alleged that employees, among other things, charged the government for using computers to operate private businesses while awaiting security clearances and to run a football pool. The suit also charged that a senior plant manager had <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> machinists build him a private airplane at government expense. Employees were also allegedly told to charge their time to contracts on which they did no work, the complaint said. The suit was filed under the False Claims Acts, a Civil War-era statute that was amended in 1986 to allow whistle-blowers to collect a percentage of judgments against companies that cheat the government. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had elected not to join the lawsuit `` after a review and investigation'' of the case. The department added, however, that it would continue to monitor the case, brought by a former software manager and a technician currently employed at the plant. The statute allows the government to intervene at a later time `` upon a showing of good cause,'' the department noted. The plant employs 23,700 workers to develop space craft, satellite systems and submarine-launched missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Space, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has vigorously denied the allegations in the complaint. But the lawsuit said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> substantiated the allegations made by <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON>, the former software manager who was fired in 1984 for allegedly padding her time card. Copies of the agency's reports were appended to the lawsuit. Ms. <PERSON> Newsham </PERSON>'s dismissal is the subject of a separate lawsuit against the company.

 A school survey of junior high students' romantic attitudes was withdrawn after parents complained that it amounted to little more than a computer dating service, school officials said Friday The survey, passed out to sixth, seventh and eighth graders at <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Sunnyside </LOCATION>, asked students' thoughts on kissing, parties, `` buns'' and other subjects. `` I think it's an overreaction,'' said <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Birr </PERSON> of the parental response. `` It was never intended to be a sexual, offensive type of survey.'' But upon review, <PERSON> Birr </PERSON> said he decided there were a few questions not `` appropriate for this age level'' and decided Thursday to collect the forms and dispose of them. The 30-question survey was put together as a fund-raiser by members of the school's science club, and passed out in class to the 11 - to 13-year-old students `` I guess I was really concerned about the judgment of the adults at that school,'' said <PERSON> Sherry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashburn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sunnyside </LOCATION>, one of the objecting parents whose son is a sixth-grader. Members of the science club were supposed to collect the completed forms and punch the data into a computer, <PERSON> Birr </PERSON> said. For $ 1, a student could receive a list of eight to 10 names of classmates of the opposite sex who shared similar interests, <PERSON> Birr </PERSON> said. `` I do n't know what they were supposed to do with those names,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mashburn </PERSON> said. `` I'd prefer my son not to do a lot. `` But he is 12 and he is interested,'' she added. The survey was called a `` Heart to Heart Personal Questionnaire.'' For the question `` When I think of kissing I get?'' possible multiple-choice answers were: really excited, interested, bored, sick or fanatic. For the question `` Which of the following fascinates you the most?'' possible answers included: electronic games, nice-looking cars, nice-looking bodies, the moon and the stars. Asked what sort of parties they liked, possible answers were: loud and wild, quiet and dignified, all, none, birthday and illegal. Another question asked which physical feature _ eyes, smile, legs or `` buns'' _ the participant noticed first in the opposite sex. `` Eleven-year-olds do n't need to worry about what their buns look like,'' parent <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herald-Republic </LOCATION>. But Birr said most of the questions involved attitudes toward friendship, sports and other personality characteristics.

 A group that once included President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new national security adviser recommended Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stagger deployment of long-range atomic weapons as part of an effort to control defense spending. The report is likely to find a receptive ear at the White House because the national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, helped write early drafts, although he dropped out of the working group following his appointment. The report reiterated a view previously stated by <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, but not repeated publicly since he joined the administration, that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vision of a Star Wars umbrella against nuclear attack would be impossible in the foreseeable future. Research has made `` clear that there is no near-term prospect that any combination of defensive sytems will make possible exclusive reliance on defense to defeat the projected threat,'' said the report, drafted by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a pair of think tanks. Spending should remain constant for strategic defenses rather than increasing sharply as requested by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, group members said. Sens. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the chairman and ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, respectively, and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s counterpart in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presented the report at a news conference with former national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is unlikely to increase defense spending this year, as requested by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in his final budget proposal, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not be able to pay for all the bombers, missiles, submarines and other systems underway. Therefore, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration must agree on which are most urgently needed, deploy them first, and then add others as necessary, they said. Two of the three legs of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear `` triad,'' the bomber and submarine forces, `` will survice any plausible Soviet attack,'' it said. `` We can not, however, extend this confidence to our land-based missiles in silos,'' it said. `` Against a surprise attack by Soviet forces, in which only about one-third of their currently available ICBM -LRB- intercontinental ballistic missile -RRB- warheads are used, only about 5 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ICBMs would survive.'' The situation could worsen under the proposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty under negotiation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, because it would reduce by about half the number of delivery systems. One side would require fewer weapons to knock out the other's fixed land-based weapons. Foremost among the group's recommendations was that the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agree to develop a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile class, to match two classes deployed by the Soviets. `` Mobility is key,'' said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. And they urged the administration to proceed cautiously on the B-2 stealth bomber to avoid a repeat of problems suffered by the B-1 bomber, which was rushed through the development stage. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> also urged the new administration to drop <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed ban on mobile missiles, arguing that such weapons reduce the danger of nuclear war since it would be almost impossible for an adversary to destroy a significant percentage in a surprise attack The group leaned toward the small road-mobile Midgetman as the best option, the same conclusion reached by a presidential commission headed by Scowcroft in 1983. The Midgetman would be more expensive than other alternatives, however, costing an estimated $ 39 billion versus $ 12 billion for a rail-mobile version of the 10-warhead MX missile and $ 19 billion to $ 40 billion for the so-called `` carry-hard'' approach, in which the MX, Midgetman or Minuteman III missile would be encased in capsules hardened against nuclear attack and scattered in a deceptive pattern among a large number of silos. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in proposing a budget for the next fiscal year, cut all money for the Midgetman in favor of the MX.

 More than two decades after a grand jury charged <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> in the shooting death of her married boyfriend, the woman pleaded innocent Friday. The woman _ who disappeared after the slaying _ was found living quietly in rural <LOCATION> Elburn </LOCATION>, married and going by the name <PERSON> Greta </PERSON> <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON>, 62, was re-indicted Wednesday on charges of murder and involuntary manslaughter in the Jan. 31, 1968, shooting death of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> in this prosperous suburb north of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` She was sad and nervous, it seemed,'' in her court appearance Friday before <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartel </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Collina </PERSON>, chief of investigations for the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney's office She was accompanied in court by her husband of 20 years, <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Collina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was set at $ 100,000, he said, adding police do not believe Mrs. <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON> is likely to flee. She remained in jail Friday afternoon. Mrs. <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON> was arrested Thursday in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where `` she was having lunch at a restaurant with her son,'' he said. `` This is a touchy situation,'' <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. `` We thought it was over years ago.'' He said his wife worked occasionally in part-time retail jobs but was primarily a homemaker. He declined to comment further, and no one answered the phone Friday at the Knickerbocker home. The case was reopened in November, when police received a tip on Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>'s whereabouts. `` She was found through a friend of her daughter's,'' <PERSON> Collina </PERSON> said. Investigators said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>' survivors lobbied hard to have charges renewed after it was learned where she was that month. At the time of the shooting 21 years ago, Mrs. <PERSON> Knickerbocker </PERSON> _ then Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> _ was a divorcee involved with <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a married, 49-year-old artist who lived in the north <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Collina </PERSON> said. `` Witnesses said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> ... had decided to go back to his wife and children,'' <PERSON> Collina </PERSON> said. `` He was breaking off the relationship.'' The shooting occurred at Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>'s coach-house apartment, <PERSON> Collina </PERSON> said. She told police at the time that she had been showing <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> a gun, and that it fired accidentally when she was handing it to him. `` The physical evidence does n't support that, according to the police,'' <PERSON> Collina </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON> was a suspect just after the shooting, but a judge at the time rejected a murder charge, ruling there was insufficient evidence. A grand jury later indicted her on a murder charge, but she had disappeared, authorities said. That indictment was withdrawn about 1975, said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> police. He did not know why the charge was dropped, but said the case had been inactive for many years. The <ORGANIZATION> Knickerbockers </ORGANIZATION> have lived near <LOCATION> Elburn </LOCATION> _ about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ since 1976, when they moved from the suburb of <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>.

 The nation's jobless rate inched up to 5.4 percent last month even as the economy created 408,000 new jobs, the government said Friday in a report showing stronger than anticipated early-year economic strength. While the report was good news for people seeking work _ in all, 700,000 Americans found jobs last month out of 865,000 who began the search _ analysts said the economy may be growing too quickly and predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would move to rein it in. The report, however, had a neglible immediate impact on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where stock prices were little changed and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.50 to 2,331.25, reducing its gain for the week to 8.39 points. January's unemployment rate was up 0.1 percentage point to 5.4 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. But that masked the job gains and the fact that a record 62.9 percent of working-age Americans were at work. `` It's a much stronger report than we thought,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` It suggests we are going into the first quarter a lot stronger than we thought. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to tighten and short-term interest rates will be going up.'' Some predicted that action will come next week, when the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets to set 1989 targets for growth in the money supply. Tight growth restrictions act as a brake on economic growth by pushing interest rates upward. In another sign of robust economic strength as 1989 began, the average manufacturing work week rose by 6 minutes to 41.0 hours. Average factory overtime held steady at 3.9 hours a week. And, in data showing the pace of wage gains picked up in January, the department said average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory workers climbed by 0.6 percent while average weekly earnings rose 1.2 percent. `` It's a quite disturbing spillover into wages of the strong job growth,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Wage increases also put more money in consumers' wallets; the resultant increased purchasing could stymie efforts to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, analysts said. The government also reported Friday that orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods surged 4.1 percent in December, the biggest rise in six months, and were up 9.7 percent for all of 1988, the best showing since 1979. `` Combine the increase in factory orders with the tremendous generation of jobs and building inflationary pressure and that smacks of anything but a soft landing,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` That smacks of a booming economy _ one that could get too hot to handle.'' The growth in new jobs, as calculated from the department's monthly sampling of households nationwide, was led by activity in the construction and the service industries Construction added 102,000 jobs, more than analysts had expected even with unseasonably warm weather in most of the country. Retail-trade jobs grew up 135,000; service industries added 75,000 workers; gains of 45,000 were recorded for manufacturing industries and for transportation and public utilities. The overall January job gain far outpaced the consensus prediction of a 250,000 increase. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deparment </ORGANIZATION> said that of the 123.4 million people in the civilian labor force last month, 116.7 million had jobs and 6.7 million were seeking employment. A separate unemployment calculation that includes the nearly 1.7 million members of the armed services stationed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also stood at 5.4 percent in January, like the civilian rate up 0.1 percentage point from December. In the civilian economy, the jobless rate among whites remained unchanged at 4.6 percent; the rate was 4 percent for white men, down from 4.1 percent, and 3.9 percent for white women, unchanged from December. Unemployment among blacks climbed to 12 percent in January from 11.6 percent, while the jobless rate among black teen-agers jumped to 34.5 percent from 29.6 percent. Unemployment among teens overall rose from 14.8 percent to 16.4 percent. There also was an increase in unemployment among Hispanics, from 7.6 percent in December to 8.4 percent last month.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON> was heckled by dissidents Friday as he accused <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> of arming <PERSON> Somali </PERSON> rebels and promised to free all political prisoners in his country. `` Stop the killing, stop the genocide,'' shouted several Somalis as <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON> was answering reporters' questions at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Outside, about 15 protesters shouted `` Samantar is a killer.'' <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON>, who has met with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to respond to accusations of human rights violations, said <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> would allow representatives of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> to visit and investigate `` without restrictions.'' The government has `` decided to release all political prisoners in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> without exception, including those interned during the last year in connection with the troubles in the north,'' <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> issued a report last September saying the government had executed as many as 1,000 unarmed civilians last year while trying to put down an insurgency in the northern part of the country on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s eastern coast. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and congressional aides noted that an Amnesty visit had been postponed from January to April. In response to reports of torture and killings, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last summer froze some $ 55 million of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the impoverished African nation. After <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> freed about 100 political prisoners recently, there were indications that lawmakers might be willing to release $ 17 million of the aid for payment of arrears to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, said congressional sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity. But <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON>'s talks this week failed to convince some lawmakers that his government was making much progress on human rights, the sources said. `` For the time being, it's promises,'' said one source. He said <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> is still rejecting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> condition for peace talks between the government and the rebels. <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON> said the rebels were being armed by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, in violation of a 1987 pact between the two countries that ended their 11-year war and stipulated that they would not arm each other's insurgents <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON> said his government had brought the matter up with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s Marxist leaders and was told they had not authorized such aid although it may have been approved at a lower level of government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say that although some 200,000 to 300,000 Somalis had found refuge in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> from last year's fighting in their country, there is no evidence to support <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s accusations that <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is arming the rebels who have been seeking to topple the government for seven years. <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON> denied rebels' claims that his government had received chemical weapons from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, but said the two countries had normalized their relations in recent years. Asked whether <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> had received shipments of conventional weapons from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to help combat the insurgency, <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON> said: `` It's possible.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they have evidence that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> sent light weapons and ammunition to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> last summer. But when asked about this in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Samantar </PERSON> denied any <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> help, the congressional sources said. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has been ruled by army general <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> since he took power in a 1969 coup. The country of 5.3 million was originally allied with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but switched allegiance to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in 1977.

 Former hostage <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON> urged Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> on Friday to seek the release of other Western captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> during his two-day visit to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> is to spend Sunday and Monday in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on the first visit by a French Cabinet minister since the Islamic revolution ousted the late <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> a decade ago. Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian still are hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most in the hands of Shiite Moslem extremists loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>, freed last May with two French diplomats after more than three years in captivity, said on <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION> he and others in a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> met with <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> earlier this week. He reviewed the conversation with <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, then said: `` A final point close to my heart, the problem of foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Mr. <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> should intercede with the Iranians, who have shown they had total power to have us freed, and I still say they are 100 percent masters of the situation.'' A Lebanese serving a life term in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for a failed attempt to assassinate a former Iranian prime minister urged <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Wednesday to demand his freedom, which he said was promised in the deal for <PERSON> Kauffmann </PERSON>'s release. `` I ask the Iranian government, which guaranteed the accord between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the parties concerned during the liberation of the hostages, to remind <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of its engagements,'' <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON> said in a statement issued through his lawyer. `` It is inadmissible to say that relations between the two countries are good while five soldiers of Islam are still in French prisons.'' President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had said he would be willing to pardon <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON> if all <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> hostages were freed at once, but after their release last May, French officials denied <PERSON> Naccache </PERSON> was part of the deal. He led a five man team in the July 1980 attempt on <PERSON> Shapour </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON>, the <PERSON> shah </PERSON>'s last prime minister. A bystander and a policeman were killed and three police officers wounded. <PERSON> Bakhtiar </PERSON>, who still lives in the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> area, was not hurt.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> hugged a child with AIDS on Friday while visiting children suffering from the deadly disease at a hospital before ending her three-day visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Hundreds of excited workers at <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> craned their necks for a glimpse of the 27-year-old princess when she arrived. `` There's been great joy in this lobby,'' said the pediatrics director, Dr. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Heagarty </PERSON>. `` The hospital has been buzzing for days.'' The visit capped the princess' short trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which included stops at a homeless shelter and day-care center on <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s Lower East Side and several nighttime social events, including a performance by the Welsh National Opera. She flew out of <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on a Concorde supersonic jet during the afternoon. At <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where she toured the pediatrics ward, the former teacher placed her finger in the curled hand of a 11-month-old boy with AIDS as the infant gazed at her from his grandmother's arms. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> stroked four other infants. Then, <PERSON> Heagarty </PERSON> said, `` unrehearsed and of her own volition ... she picked up a little boy who has AIDS and hugged him'' after first asking the 7-year-old: `` Are you heavy?'' The princess also attended a 10-minute briefing given by <ORGANIZATION> Heagarty </ORGANIZATION>; Dr. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the head of the pediatrics AIDS unit; and <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Grates </PERSON>, the nursing director. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> long has been a champion of the battle against acquired immune deficiency syndrome. In 1987, she declined to wear gloves while shaking the hands of AIDS patients at <LOCATION> Middlesex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, helping to ease the stigma of the disease, which can not be transmitted through casual contact. From the hospital, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> went to a private reception at the residence of British Consul General <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jewkes </PERSON> for about 60 contributors to the Royal Academy of Music. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>, said the Princess seemed at ease and stuck to small talk, mainly about her visit, while she circulated among the groups of guests `` She listened as much as she spoke,'' <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> said. `` And she talked to everybody in the group.'' When she was excusing herself from <PERSON> Curley </PERSON>'s group, he recalled her saying: `` I've to put on my skates and move on.''

 A veteran <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> county commissioner has told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> he doubts that <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-designate <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was trying to buy influence when his medical school put another county commissioner on its payroll. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which is conducting a background investigation on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, questioned him about the nominee's connection with <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON>, a commissioner who was suspended upon conviction of extortion last May. <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> public figures interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> say agents have concentrated on <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s links to <LOCATION> Eaves </LOCATION>. It is this continuing inquiry that prompted the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week to get <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to indefinitely postpone <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s confirmation hearing. Eaves was paid more than $ 34,000 over four years as a guest lecturer at <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> while he promoted school issues before the commission. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>. Published reports has said Eaves gave only two lectures. <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> dismissed the idea that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> hired Eaves to increase <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>'s influence on commission votes. `` I was not aware of whether Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> knew or did not know about Eaves' being hired. I guessed that he did not,'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in recounting his interview with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, which he said lasted 10-15 minutes. Eaves, who knew <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> from their undergraduate days at <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, was an active supporter of the medical school which <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> founded, but <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said the rest of the commissioners also strongly backed the school. `` The support for <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> was solid. We were committed to do what we had to do for <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. `` There was nothing Eaves could do to make that more solid.'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said commissioners were unaware <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> was on the school's payroll during the four years, but the link between <LOCATION> Eaves </LOCATION> and the school became public last July after Eaves was convicted <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said he did not know how much direct contact Eaves had with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. `` An old-time seasoned politician might have looked at that and might have asked, ` What's going on?' But <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is not a politician. He's an administrator,'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. `` If there's any sin on Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s part, it's that he's not a seasoned politician,'' <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. Few issues involving <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> came before the board, though the ones that did were important and usually involved large appropriations to the school, <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> said. Earlier, <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> he was unsure whether <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, his friend and associate, knew he was being paid as a lecturer at the school and that the nominee had never tried to influence him improperly, according to Eaves' lawyer, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Eaves was questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week at a federal prison in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where he is serving a six-year sentence, <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> said Eaves was convicted of accepting $ 35,000 from an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent in exchange for votes on zoning issues. Reached by telephone at the prison Friday, <PERSON> Eaves </PERSON> declined to discuss his relationship with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, whom he said he has known since 1952. He said he is not granting any interviews because his case is on appeal. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has refused to discuss its background investigation. On Capitol Hill, the questions about <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s link to Eaves do not appear to threaten his nomination to head the largest federal department. `` We do n't read anything into this at all,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

 Space shuttle Discovery moved to the launch pad Friday but it may have to be taken back to a hangar if technicians on a tight schedule ca n't replace three engine pumps in time for a mid-March liftoff. The five astronauts who will fly the mission rode partway to the launch pad with their spaceship, and later swooped low over the pad in three T-38 jets as they headed back to their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The shuttle arrived at the pad about 1 p.m. Tip Talone, Discovery's processing director, said March 10 is the earliest possible launch for the planned five-day mission. Officials had said earlier that if Discovery could not be launched by March 18, it would have to yield the pad to <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION>, set for liftoff on April 28. But on Friday, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said they might extend that March 18 deadline a few days by trimming the potential number of launch days available to <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION>. Only one shuttle launch pad is currently available while a second is being refurbished. Atlantis has priority over Discovery for use of that launch pad because it is to send the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> probe to <PERSON> Venus </PERSON>. If Atlantis is not launched April 28 to May 23, <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> will not be in the proper alignment with <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> project again until 1991. By contrast, the Discovery flight could be rescheduled relatively quickly if it has to be postponed. `` If we can get -LRB- Discovery -RRB- out of here in mid-March, we will protect the <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION> ` window,''' <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> said, referring to the period available for the Atlantis launch. `` We're going to make it.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> would like to have the entire launch period available for Atlantis in case problems develop. But it might be willing to shorten that window slightly if Discovery is nearly ready March 18. If Discovery's three suspect turbopumps ca n't be replaced in time, its mission with a communications satellite would be put off until later this year. <PERSON> Talone </PERSON> acknowledged there is a lot of work to be done and some uncertainty about how long the pump replacement will take, because technicians have never made such a changeout with a shuttle in the vertical position. He said he expects all three of the old pumps to be out by next Friday. The new units will arrive here the week of Feb. 12 and the plan is to have all installed and checked out by the end of February. `` We do n't feel any pressure on this,'' he said. After Atlantis flew in December, an inspection of the shuttle's engines disclosed two tiny cracks in a bearing housing in one of three high-speed turbopumps that convert liquid oxygen to a gas Engineers believe the cracks were caused by stress corrosion resulting from moisture trapped inside the housing during the manufacturing process. Because two of Discovery's turbopumps underwent the same processing, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> decided to replace all three pumps with new, carefully inspected units, and to delay a planned Feb. 23 launch. Shuttle engineers said Friday they think the corrosion resulted when the trapped moisture mixed with chlorine from a common household cleaner. They said the cleaning material probably was not thoroughly wiped off after a scrub-down. The pumps are critical because the shuttle could explode if one failed during liftoff. Attached to its two solid fuel booster rockets and external fuel tank, Discovery moved out of an assembly building into the darkness at 6 a.m. to begin a four-mile trip that ended seven hours later at Launch Pad 39B. The transporter, a giant tracked vehicle called a crawler, traveled at a maximum speed of 1 mph. The astronauts rode part of the way on the crawler. They are commander <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaha </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bagian </PERSON>. As they left for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, they swung their jets in a wide circle over Discovery, then about half a mile from the pad.

 Opposition leaders said Friday that the man who may be the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> helped orchestrate the civil war in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and is a master of meddling in other nations' affairs Right-wing and leftist groups said relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would worsen if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selects <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> as the next ambassador. Sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said this week that <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>, a deputy national security adviser, will be picked to replace Ambassador <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilliod </PERSON>. When he served as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> from 1982 to 1985, <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> had a major role in assisting the U.S.-backed rebels seeking to overthrow the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was a major base of operations for the rebels, known as Contras. Critics also said <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> also sought unduly to influence the Honduran government. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it would not comment publicly on the selection until it had advised the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government of its views. But leftist and conservative parties suggested <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> investigate allegations about <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> and consider rejecting him. `` National authorities have the right to keep officials who are highly discredited and who have violated human rights from assuming posts in <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> territory,'' <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying by the liberal daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. <PERSON> Amalia </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest leftist party, urged the government not to accept the appointment, the newspaper said. She was quoted as saying it `` will make problems more complex and deepen differences between the two nations.'' <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON>, leader of the congressional delegation of the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolution </ORGANIZATION>, also called for a thorough analysis of <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON>'s background, saying, `` according to reports about him, he's an expert in combating the libertarian forces of the Latin American countries.'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Colegio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norte </ORGANIZATION>, a northern think tank in <LOCATION> Tijuana </LOCATION>, said in a television interview on Friday that the choice was `` bad news for bilateral relations'' and worked against <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s efforts to achieve peace in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> opposes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contras. The independent but pro-government daily Excelsior ran a lengthy front-page story on Thursday describing <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> as a diplomat who `` has earned the reputation of being more astute and calculating than <PERSON> Machiavelli </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION>, in a front-page editorial on Thursday, called the appointment `` an ominous decision'' and began a three-part series called `` The Path of an Ultra-Hawk.'' The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> `` simply complied, like a good ambassador, with orders from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'' in the rebel effort. <PERSON> Negroponte </PERSON> had a close relationship with Gen. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who was head of the Honduran military from 1982 until his overthrow in 1984 and for a time was considered for a time the most powerful figure in the country.

The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters ferried Peruvian police, but neither the aircraft nor <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents were present during the fight. Police said the 1,570 pounds of cocaine base, which can be refined into an an approximately equal quantity of pure cocaine, was one of the largest single seizures of the drug in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. They said the raid took place Thursday at an airfield on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Uchiza </LOCATION> in the cocaine-producing <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, about 265 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Officials said police moved in while traffickers were loading the drugs on a plane. They said 15 were arrested after the gunfight, and no police were injured.

Police said the drugs seized Thursday were worth $ 14 million locally but several times more when refined and sold abroad.

 Federal regulators Friday announced the resignation of <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>, the executive director of the fund that insures saving and loan deposits. Root, appointed to head the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in October 1987, submitted his resignation on Monday. It will be effective Feb. 10. Replacing Root as acting director will be <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON>, currently principal deputy director of operations, according to a statement released Friday evening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency. The statement said Root, an attorney, would `` return to the private sector.'' The telephone at Root's office was not answered Friday evening. A bank board official, who declined to be identified, said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> had decided earlier that he would step down after regulators' completed their year-end rush to sell insolvent S & amp; Ls before lucrative tax breaks were halved on Jan. 1 The official noted that top <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> officials maintained a brutal work pace, including a 16-hour day on Chistmas. `` He just thought it was time to go back to the private sector,'' the official said. <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the bank board, praised Root for his `` substantial personal sacrifice'' and `` invaluable service.'' Root, previously a lawyer at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firm of <ORGANIZATION> Cadwalader </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wickersham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, presided over roughly the first half of what will be the largest government rescue of an industry ever. He had been a top officer of <ORGANIZATION> Bowery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from 1981 to 1983. Under Root's direction, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> last year pledged $ 38 billion to merge or close 205 insolvent institutions and keep 18 others afloat. Seventy-five of the resolutions came in a final frenzy during December. About 350 insolvent institutions remain. <PERSON> Creedon </PERSON> has been a bank board career employee since 1973, with intervening service in what was then the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. She had previously served as acting <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> director from December 1983 until March 1987. She plans to return to her career position as deputy director when the bank board finds a permanent <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> director, which is a politically-appointed post, the statement said.

<TEXT>
 Soviet cadets may be strolling around the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> campus next fall while <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cadets study at Russian military academies, officials said Friday. An exchange of cadets between the two superpowers has been approved by top government officials, according to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> officials. The idea was first proposed last July by the deputy commander of the Soviet ground force, Col. Gen. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinkevich </PERSON>, during a visit to West Point. The exchange of military cadets would be for brief periods, probably lasting two weeks initially, according to Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>, director of academy relations at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. `` Anything can happen, of course, but there is no plan for it to develop into anything longer than a short-term program,'' <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> said. The purpose of the exchange would be to help <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Soviet cadets better understand each other. `` It's a cultural exchange program with military implications, of course,'' said <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON>. `` The purpose is ... not for us to learn the inner workings of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the program's benefits may be decades away. `` These will be 19 and 20 year olds. It will not be for some years that they will be in any position to make decisions that might result in an easing of tensions, but who knows? This may pay dividends in the future.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials were to meet in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to negotiate the timing of the exchange. The proposed program reflects a significant change in Soviet-American relations at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. Two years ago <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> astronaut <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzhanibekov </PERSON> was forbidden by the Army to speak at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, and an invitation to poet <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON> was withdrawn on orders from the Pentagon. For 100 years, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> has been training foreign cadets in a four-year program. Currently, 30 cadets from foreign countries are at the military academy.

<HEAD>Mayor Orders Graphic Vietnam War Photos Moved To Less Prominent Spot</HEAD>

 The mayor ordered 11 photographs in a Vietnam War exhibit that made some people `` literally sick to their stomach'' moved from City Hall lobbies to a less traveled corridor, an official said Friday. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>, an aide to Mayor <PERSON> Biagio </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLieto </PERSON>, said the rest of the exhibit, 56 photographs, remained in the lobbies. <PERSON> DiLieto </PERSON> feared the material was too graphic for children who regularly visit the building on tours, <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON> said. In addition, he said, some city employees complained after seeing the photographs. `` Some were literally sick to their stomach,'' he said. But veterans said the point of the traveling exhibit is to illustrate the horrors of war, and that moving the offending photographs undermined the message. `` I think the exhibit is the most powerful anti-war statement I've seen. If people have to be made a little uncomfortable to understand what war is about, I think that's fine. It's worth the jolt,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Amabile </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the collection. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomorrow </PERSON>, an artist and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who helped city officials hang the exhibit earlier this week, said the mayor's action was `` very insulting to the spirit of the photographers who died to take the pictures. All 67 photographs were taken by news photographers who were killed in the war or are listed as missing in action. `` I can respect that some people may be disturbed by it, but I think they should also realize there is freedom of speech,'' Tomorrow said. The 11 photos show dead or wounded soldiers and civilians, including one of bodies of 13 Vietnamese lying face down on a mud flat and another of a medic attending to a young girl with a hole in her thigh. <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON> said the mayor, by not removing the 11 photographs entirely, sought to accommodate people who wanted to see the entire exhibit and those who may find the most graphic pictures too painful. Most of the 15 previous exhibits of the collection have been at art galleries or museums, but the show has been displayed at a private high school and in a lobby of the state government complex in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, N.Y. Visitors to galleries or museums are `` tacitly agreeing they will accept being shocked, surprised or delighted,'' said <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Real </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>'s cultural affairs director. `` When people walk into City Hall, they may end up being shocked or surprised, but that's not why they are coming.''

 Gunmen in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> fired at a North Korean military post in the demilitarized zone and `` committed a grave military provocation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The government-controlled news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said `` some 10 armed bandits'' fired several rounds of machine-gun fire toward the post on the North Korean side on Friday. Radio <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> also reported the alleged incident, saying it `` seriously threatened'' the North Korean security guards on duty, and destroyed some facilities at the military post. `` The South Korean puppets committed a grave military provocation by firing large-caliber machine-gun bullets at a post of our side in the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION>,'' southeast of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sobang </LOCATION> in the central part of the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION> that divides <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> from its communist neighbor to the north, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> news agency said. The `` military provocation'' of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> `` fully shows that they seek confrontation and war, not detente and dialogue,'' the news agency said.

 Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, who returned Friday from her two-day visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, won praise from British newspapers for making it a success, but some said the city expected a combination of superstar and girl next door. `` The Big Apple Goes Bananas Over Princess,'' the Sun tabloid crowed in a headline. The Daily Mail called her the `` Queen of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'' in glowing coverage. Some papers reported cool spots in a warm reception, and one said Americans are over-eager and do n't understand real royalty. `` Americans love a star with a generosity that is not quite British,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> wrote in the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are imbued with an egalitarian streak that demands their stars be as human as the boy or girl next door. `` This creates a sense of impatience that the royals insist on the protocols of address and seniority even ` off-screen' and a refusal to accept that in such delicate matters as love and marriage they are different from that boy and girl next door.'' He and other British reporters said Americans had asked whether making the trip alone meant <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> and was having marriage problems with her husband, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, heir to the British throne. That sort of speculation was front-page news in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for a time last year. The Telegraph gave first honors for what it called royal exploitation to a shop that displayed `` crude'' mannequins of the royal family with boxes for heads. To The Times, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s reception was `` hot and cold'' and interpreted critical reports as anti-British. `` While small crowds of fans gathered to cheer and socialites gathered for eleventh-hour tickets'' to a reception, it said, `` others were declaring their distaste for royal fuss.'' `` <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s welcome for the princess veered to the extremes for which the city is famous,'' the August journal pronounced. Reports in most papers ooohed and aaahed over both <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>'s poise and the fans who praised her glamour or waited for a quick glimpse. `` Leaving Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> behind on her first visit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, she enchanted hardened New Yorkers and turned thousands of ordinary Americans into avid royalists,'' the tabloid <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> said. It printed a picture of <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> with the caption `` Instant hit.'' Columnist <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammill </PERSON> called <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> the `` most famous welfare mother in the world,'' they said, an apparent reference to the fact that her mother-in-law, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, and other members of the royal family receive government allowances. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, live on his income from from land and investments and do not receive such an allowance.

<TEXT>
 A member of the Soviet trade mission in the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> capital has been expelled for spying, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said Friday. The Foreign Ministry protested to the Soviet Embassy over illegal activities by the diplomat, who had sought access to secret military and other advanced technology in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> since 1987, the office said. The Soviet official, whose name and position were not published, built contacts with Swiss companies and individuals with the aim of gaining access to Western high technology and placing agents in industries targeted by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the prosecutor's office statement said. The diplomat has been recalled by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and was barred from re-entering <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the statement said.

<HEAD>Bar Association President Calls For Waiting Period For Gun Purchases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Friday he has asked Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to recommend a federal waiting period for the purchase of firearms, saying loopholes in gun laws make it easy to buy semiautomatic weapons. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Raven </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> attorney and president of an organization that represents 350,000 lawyers nationwide, said at a news conference that the growing civilian use of military assault weapons has focused attention on `` a problem which our nation can not afford to ignore.'' The association is meeting this weekend in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. He cited the recent slaying of five schoolchildren and wounding of 30 others in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and a shooting last week at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, school in which four were wounded. <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said that the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 gives <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> the power to develop and begin a federal system to identify potential purchasers of handguns who are ineligible by federal law to own firearms. `` We urge you to conduct the necessary study and swiftly complete your recommendations, and we specifically urge you to recommend a federal waiting period prior to the purchase of firearms,'' he wrote in his Feb. 2 letter to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. In the letter, <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> did not recommend a time frame for a waiting period. <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said he has not heard from <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, but that he hopes to talk with him Saturday when the attorney general is scheduled to attend the meeting. <PERSON> Raven </PERSON> said recent reports indicate the number of assault rifle sales has risen from 4,000 in 1985 to nearly 40,000 last year. He said there is a `` glaring loophole in federal gun laws'' that has created easy public access to the assault weapons, which can be easily modified to be fully automatic. `` This problem is not going to go away on its own. After the <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> incident, people flocked to gun shops to buy AK-47 lookalikes or other semiautomatic military weapons,'' he said. `` Just last week, a gunman opened fire on 200 students at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, school, wounding four. Our nation must take immediate action to put an end to such gun-related violence.'' Also Friday, former Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> addressed the conference and urged lawyers to support a national community service program. He said it would replace student loan programs with a program that requires two to four years of community service in return for a college education.

 Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s long tenure as dictator ended because he tampered too much with the institution that propelled him into power 34 years ago: the military. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> tried to force his most powerful military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, into retirement, and his recent shakeups of the army caused widespread resentment among his officers. That, combined with <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s ultimate plans to have his son succeed him as president, led to the violent coup that ended the 76-year-old general's rule and vaulted <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to power on Friday. `` <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> tried to take away some of the regiments controlled by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and thus reduce his power _ a technique he -LRB- <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> -RRB- has used for years. But this time he committed a very big indiscretion,'' <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Insfran </PERSON>, an interior minister for 10 years during the 1950s and 1960s, said in an interview. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was bolstered by disaffected officers who resented a reshuffling last month that resulted in the retirement of about 100 army colonels and 35 navy captains, said opposition leader <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Authentic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and leader of the National Accord opposition coalition. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> -RRB- took advantage of the general ill feeling within most of the military units to deal <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> a lethal blow,'' said <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>, who returned in 1987 from a long period of exile and now is <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s best-known human rights activist. Conflict between the two generals had been simmering since 1984, when the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> split divisively into two factions: the militants who supported <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> unconditionally, and the traditionalists who favored democratic reforms and a distancing of the 101-year-old party from the unpopular, authoritarian ruler. Differences between <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> reportedly came to a head in 1987, when the militant faction wrested leadership of the party from traditionalists by using strong-arm tactics, including the barring of traditionalist delegates from entering the congress where leaders were elected. At that congress, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON>, in his 25th year as party chairman, was unseated by <PERSON> Sabino </PERSON> <PERSON> Montonaro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s interior minister. On Friday, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> replaced <ORGANIZATION> Chaves </ORGANIZATION>, 87, as chairman to the cheers of 15,000 people who gathered outside the party headquarters. In the five months since <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> underwent a prostate operation, from which he has been slow to recover, his militant supporters have promoted his son <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON>, a lieutenant colonel in the air force, to succeed him. That, too, alienated the military. `` <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> wanted to break away from the militant group that was pushing for the continuance of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> line by saying, ` After <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, Another <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>,''' said <PERSON> Laino </PERSON>. In the perspective of <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, `` The detonating factor was the threat of retiring <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>.'' In spite of the predominantly military motives for the rebellion, opposition leaders remain optimistic that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> could bring greater democratization of <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. `` We have firm hopes ... a government of transition can not survive without a democratic opening,'' said <PERSON> Euclides </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Febrerista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Other factors, such as <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>'s deteriorating economy and <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s apparent failing health, played a role in the rebellion. `` The military crisis alone could not have done this,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galaverna </PERSON> of the dissident <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's important to remember the real protagonists are the people and the military has simply been the instrument. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Insfran </PERSON>, `` The military issue is over now. Now they have to deal with the political problem.''

<UNK>1988 Average Global Temperature Was Warmest</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last year's global average temperature was the warmest of the century, and the six warmest years of the century all have occurred in this decade, a study shows. Meteorological officials said it was too early to conclusively blame the greenhouse effect, by which heat from the sun is trapped in the atmosphere by gases acting like the glass walls in a greenhouse. `` While a warming of this amount is consistent with the greenhouse effect caused by the rise in the levels of carbon dioxide and other man-made gases in the atmosphere, the earth's temperature fluctuates considerably due to natural causes and no unambigious connection can yet be made,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a climate expert at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Meterological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Bracknell </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. It could take 20 years of temperature rises before the greenhouse effect could be detected with much certainty, he said in a recent interview. The apparent warming trend was revealed in analyses of global weather records by the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anglia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. Their work showed that 1988's global average temperature was 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, 0.5 degrees higher than the 30-year global average ending in 1979. Since 1979, the succession of tiny increases has been too steady for the weathermen to ignore, <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. The six warmest years in the century have all been in this decade, he said. They were 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980 and 1986, in descending order of warmth. Global temperatures have risen by about 0.8 degrees since the beginning of the century, he said. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has had a mild winter, with temperatures averaging 5 degrees above the normal temperature of 40 degrees in December and January. Spring flowers are shooting up and blooming, and a blackbird nested and reared its young two months early in a department store's outdoor Christmas tree in <LOCATION> Cheltenham </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> The debate over whether there is a greenhouse effect has been fueled by unusual weather patterns in recent years, including a serious drought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last summer. Last week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> scientists said they could find no evidence of any overall temperature increases for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1895 to 1987. But they stressed that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> makes up only 6 percent of the earth's surface and said studies of other portions of the earth could have different results.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on Friday accused the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> navy officers of plotting to falsely portray the Nicaraguan government as an arms supplier to leftist Salvadoran guerrillas. Officials said four Nicaraguan criminals were hired to steal weapons from the Nicaraguan army and smuggle them into <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, where the arms were to be `` intercepted'' and shown as proof that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista government was aiding the rebels. The Nicaraguan government has long denied that it has shipped weapons to the guerrillas fighting <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s U.S.-backed government. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> charges and no spokesmen were immediately available at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, because of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s visit A Salvadoran navy spokesman, Lt. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellanos </PERSON>, said he knew nothing about the accusations. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Loza </PERSON>, operations chief for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, said the alleged plot came to light after the four Nicaraguans were arrested in December and January during an investigation of a crime streak in <LOCATION> Chinandega </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, two provinces close to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Loza </PERSON> said the men never got a chance to actually steal any weapons. `` This is a group of delinquents used by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and Salvadoran naval intelligence in subversive acts against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Loza </PERSON> said. `` That's the only type of people they can hire now.'' <PERSON> Loza </PERSON> spoke at a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the security agency. He said the men were robbery suspects who fled to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in November. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> is across the Gulf of <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coast. After being arrested in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the men allegedly were approached by <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents and <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> officials who offered them $ 10,000 and told to return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and steal weapons from a military installation on <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castanones </LOCATION>, a small island off the northwestern port of <LOCATION> Corinto </LOCATION>. He said the men also were promised $ 5,000 for each Redeye surface-to-air heat-seeking missile they stole and about $ 200 for each AK-47 assault rifle.

 Some danced, some sang, some merely gaped at the pools of blood in the street. Thousands cheered the end of a 34-year-old dictatorship, and others wondered whether a new one had begun. Thousands of people poured out of the homes on Friday, the morning after the night that Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was overthrown by his second-in-command, Gen. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. For many, <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was the only leader they have ever had, a man who snatched power in a 1954 coup, then lost it more than three decades later to another military leader. But Paraguayans of all ages and political persuasions left their homes to celebrate, to satisfy curiousity and to simply stare at the damage left by nearly five hours of heavy fighting between rebels and loyalist troops. An estimated 5,000 people gathered in downtown <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. Two blocks from the rallying crowd, wreckers towed away bullet-riddled cars that were caught when rebel tanks and troops attacked police loyal to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. Five hundred yards away, about 100 troops guarded the gray, 19th century presidential palace overlooking the <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> where <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> ruled and where <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was sworn in. Two miles from downtown, small groups of citizens gathered in front of the presidential escort battalion which remained loyal to <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> and was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting throughout the night. The roof of one of the four buildings had collapsed, and there were gaping holes in the brick walls. Caravans of cars, many flying the red, white and blue Paraguayan flag _ or the crimson banner of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or the blue banner of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ drove through downtown, horns honking. The nation's principal radio stations and their mobile units carried on a marathon of interviews with politicians and citizens, many of whom suffered at the hands of the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> regime. `` I think that the era of terrorism and corruption that affected our country for so long has come to an end, thanks to the armed forces,'' said <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Color </ORGANIZATION>, the country's biggest newspaper at the time it was shut down by the <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> government in 1984 for, among other reasons, `` preaching hatred among Paraguayans.'' <PERSON> Zuccolillo </PERSON> said he will reopen the paper as soon as he can obtain printing paper and ink. `` I'm happy that this man -LRB- <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> -RRB- is gone for good, but I'm sad about the dead,'' said a young waitress who spent the night huddled in a restaurant near the police headquarters Estimates of the dead ranged up to 200. `` I do n't know if we're going too have democracy and liberty now, but we've taken the first step,'' said <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nanduti </ORGANIZATION>, forced to close in 1987 for its criticism of the government.

 <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, is considering a run for governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> next year, two newspapers reported Friday. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who is well known in national political circles but not a household name in his home state, was described as weighing a run for governor in stories that appeared on Friday's front pages of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and The Wall Street Journal. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who has never held elected office, is stepping down next week as <ORGANIZATION> DNC </ORGANIZATION> chairman. He was traveling in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> on Friday and could not be reached. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, Democratic professionals said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> could be a formidable candidate. The apparently orchestrated effort to float his name as a contender took some Democratic political veterans by surprise, but nearly all agreed that he would be a serious candidate. `` I'm surprised. My own sense of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s decision was he wanted to return to private life,'' said political pollster and consultant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marttila </PERSON>. But he added, `` He's a capable, talented human being.'' <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, 51, was born in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> and owns a home in <ORGANIZATION> Marston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>. He had worked for a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> law firm and was expected to return there. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who turned down a chance for another four years as committee chairman, would be seeking the post of Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the former Democratic presidential nominee who has said he will not seek re-election next year. Likely Democratic candidates for governor include Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellotti </PERSON>. In addition, there is great suspense surrounding the plans of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> II. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> was a longtime aide to Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and served as political director in the senator's 1980 presidential race According to <PERSON> Marttila </PERSON> and others, it is highly unlikely that <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> would enter a Democratic primary for governor if the race included <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the senator's nephew. The younger <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> has topped the list of preliminary polls of likely candidates for governor, but he has not revealed his plans.

 In a sex discrimination challenge to the Scholastic Aptitude Test, a federal judge ruled Friday that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state may not use SAT scores as the sole criterion in determining scholarship winners. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said it apparently was the first case in which female students sought to use federal civil rights statutes to challenge a state's reliance upon standardized tests. `` The evidence is clear that females score significantly below males on the SAT while they perform equally or slightly better than males in high school,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> wrote. The judge said the state <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and its commissioner, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON>, both named in the suit, rely solely upon the SAT in awarding Regents and Empire scholarships. He said that practice `` deprives young women of the opportunity to compete equally for these prestigious scholarships.'' The judge ordered the state to change its method of awarding the scholarships. State officials said they had no immediate comment on the ruling. <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinzler </PERSON>, director of the Women's Rights Project for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and lead attorney for the case, hailed the decision. `` It's really a very important, precedent-setting case,'' she said. `` It's really not fair to anybody to give a scholarship based on a three-hour test given on a Saturday afternoon rather than -LRB- basing it upon -RRB- four years of high school.'' <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> vonMayrhauser, general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, the creator of the SAT, said: `` I think it -LRB- the ruling -RRB- will have limited application. Critics of the SAT will have false comfort'' if they think the test is doomed. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> are the only states that give state scholarships based solely upon SAT scores. The suit was filed by the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and 10 female students.

 Director-actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>, known for his free-wheeling, improvisational style in such movies as `` Faces'' and `` A Woman Under the Influence,'' died Friday. He was 59. <PERSON> Gena </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON>, his wife of three decades and the star of most of his films, was at his side when he died at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said his publicist, <PERSON> Esme </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandlee </PERSON>. He died of complications resulting from cirrhosis of the liver, Ms. <PERSON> Chandlee </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> was one of only four entertainers ever to be nominated for an Academy Award in three different categories, Ms. <PERSON> Chandlee </PERSON> said. He was nominated as best writer for his original screenplay of `` Faces'' in 1968; as best supporting actor in `` The Dirty Dozen'' in 1967; and as best director for his original film `` A Woman Under the Influence'' in 1974. Among <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>' best-known acting roles was as the husband of a woman who conceives a baby by the devil in `` <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON>'s Baby,'' a 1968 film that also starred <PERSON> Mia </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrow </PERSON>. He also starred with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON>, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarandon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Ringwald </PERSON> in `` Tempest,'' director <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazursky </PERSON>'s film adaptation of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s play, among other films. `` Faces,'' which he also directed, was a personal, probing study of loneliness. The film won three Oscar nominations and five <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> Film Festival awards. `` A Woman Under the Influence'' is the story of the souring of a middle-class marriage, which starred his wife. `` I think they both had a great fondness for ` A Woman Under the Influence,''' Ms. <PERSON> Chandlee </PERSON> said of Cassavetes and Miss <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON>. `` It was certainly his most commercial film.'' The movie earned Miss Rowlands a Golden Globe as best actress and an Academy Award nomination for best actress. His first movie as a director was `` Shadows,'' filmed from 1957-60 on what amounted to pennies, using a hand-held 16mm camera. Technically, the film was a misfit. But as an art form, it has been referred to by film buffs as a masterpiece. The movie is about a fair-skinned black girl living in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with her two brothers. `` The type of films we do are different,'' <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> once said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Commercial movies have no feeling, no sensitivity. Most people tell me that people wo n't understand films with feeling But everyone can feel. `` I think people are very stiff. Money makes people stiff and we want it and we have to pay the penalty. I never agreed with stiffness. I think people have an understanding of what their life is. I define success by being a realist and not humiliating people. I'm a revolutionary _ but not in the political sense.'' In 1980, he was honored by the Museum of Modern Art with a retrospective of his works. That same year, he was also honored by Filmex, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Film Festival. He was 50 at the time. `` By the age of 50, I would like to know that I'm not dead _ that there's some continuity to my life,'' he said. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, grew up poor. His break in acting came when he played a brooding young bullfighter in a production of the old `` Omnibus'' TV series in 1953. That led to roles in `` Playhouse 90,'' `` Studio One,'' `` Kraft Theater'' and `` Climax.'' His official debut on the silver screen was as an extra in `` 14 Hours'' in 1951. He starred in `` Taxi'' in 1953 and was in `` The Night Holds Terror'' in 1955. He remained an independent filmmaker who marched to the tune of a different drummer. `` If it came to a good film or what makes feeling, I'd take feeling,'' he once said. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> developed close friendships with a few actors, including <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON>. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> said he was `` devastated'' by <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON>' death, and production of the reprised `` Columbo'' television series was halted so <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> could be at home alone. `` This has been a terrible jolt for <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>,'' said his assistant, April Araynell. `` There was a very strong bond between them, a love between them. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> is just trying to hold up any way he can.'' <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Rowlands </PERSON> were married in March 1958 and their careers were seldom separate after that. They had three children: <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zoe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cassavetes </PERSON> had a vast enthusiasm for films, especially his own. `` ` A Woman Under the Influence' rips your guts out,'' he said. `` I have seen it 30 times and I ca n't look at it any more. It is too powerful an experience.'' Private funeral services were scheduled for Monday in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Are Bush and Greenspan in Disagreement?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While critics say he has broadcast dissonant signals about the economy's health, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has made it clear beyond any misunderstanding that his No. 1 fear is inflation. Based on <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s repeated acknowledgment of that fear, and his actions in allowing interest rates to rise substantially since becoming <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> chairman, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> might appear to be at odds with the White House. Is he? On January 24, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that in his view inflation was too high _ from the fourth quarter of 1987 to the fourth of 1988 the gross national product deflator, a measure of inflation, rose 4.1 percent compared with 3.1 percent a year earlier. He said it might have been even worse were it not for higher interest rates. The next day President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stated that his fears of inflation were not as acute as those apparently held by <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, igniting rumors of a rift between the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> denies it, stating that such notions are exaggerations. The White House has n't declared itself on whether there is a disagreement but there are signs that a fundamental one could develop. It lies in differing priorities. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has a lot of experience with inflation, having honed his advisory skills during the days of the great and unlamented inflation of the 1970s. He knows that when it gets a head of steam it ca n't be stopped short of a crash. In his view, that point may be approaching. There is evidence that labor is beginning to press for more costly benefits if not higher wages. The jobless rate is down to very low 5.3 percent and perhaps falling still. There may be little idle industrial capacity that can accommodate further growth. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s economic plan is based on economic growth, which rising interest rates generally obstruct. There are many reasons, political and economic, for seeking that growth. None is more important than this: Growth means revenues. Nobody needs to be reminded how important higher revenues are for reducing a budget deficit, which the administration is commanded by law to do. Higher revenues improve your options; you do n't need cut politically popular projects. Higher interest rates can cause a lot more problems for the administration, if only for the reason that nobody owes more money and pays more interest than Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>. Interest costs today are about 15 percent of budget outlays. Higher interest rates also impact business development. The answer to capacity restraints is for industry to expand production facilities. But will that happen if business fears interest rates will continue to climb? The expansion issue touches on two more important considerations, the value of the dollar and the trade deficit. Higher interest rates might strengthen the dollar. A stronger dollar would hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, and might raise imports. Higher interest costs also would add difficulties to an already impossibly complex and politically tricky issue, that of bailing out the failed savings and loan associations. As it is, this issue is a no-win situation anyway. Nobody yet knows, for example, where the scores of billions of dollars needed will come from. Now consider that just tiny increases in interest rates could make that job billions of dollars more difficult to manage. It might be, as <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> indicates, that any differences of opinion with the White House are exaggerated. But the potential is there, and if only minor differences now exist they could become exaggerated by events.

<HEAD>`Kermitterrand' the Frog Knocks French Politicians on TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For millions of French television viewers, the nightly news begins when <LOCATION> Kermitterrand </LOCATION> the Frog discusses the day's events over aperitifs with a long-haired pig in pearls and an anxious eagle called <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> This is the Babete Show -LRB- Dumb Animals Show -RRB-, five minutes of Gallic wit and sarcasm broadcast nightly on the private TF1 station before the 8 p.m. news and featuring <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s favorite political puppets. The takeoff on Sesame Street's Muppets is not intended for children only. The undisputed star of the show is <LOCATION> Kermitterrand </LOCATION>, a wide-mouthed bright green frog, who combines the face of President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> with the body of the <ORGANIZATION> Muppets </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON>. He also is known as God. The show has become a must for some 36 percent of the television audience _ 7.2 million homes _ making it <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s most-watched show. Taxi drivers and doctors tune in, but no one follows it as closely as politicians. A single episode can touch on a half-dozen news items ranging from the firing of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> as artistic director of the new Opera-Bastille to an insider trading scandal. `` We take the news, then twist and torture it,'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Amadou </PERSON>, a well-known satirist and one of the show's creators, said in an interview. `` By having the puppets talk in down-to-earth, everyday language we show that the coded, esoteric talk of politicians is worn out.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who is a Socialist, reportedly is amused by <PERSON> Kermitterrand </PERSON>'s ranting and raving and has aides record his antics when he ca n't watch them himself. The president has also been known to regale intimates with imitations of <LOCATION> Kermitterrand </LOCATION>, and references to the show have crept into his speeches. The anxious eagle, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, is a play on former Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>. The long-haired pig in pearls -LRB- Miss Piggie in the Muppets -RRB- is supposed to be <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON>, the French Communist leader. Their colorful cohorts include <LOCATION> Rocroa </LOCATION> the crow -LRB- Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, also a Socialist -RRB-; <PERSON> Barzy </PERSON>, the kind, cuddly bear -LRB- former Premier <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> -RRB-, and a curly haired goat -LRB- Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> -RRB-. `` Please excuse this question which might seem idiotic, Oh Great Monarch of Triumph, but were n't you supposed to be in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> today, bah-bah,'' Lang-the-goat asked <PERSON> Kermitterrand </PERSON> in a recent episode. `` Of course I'm in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, puerile lamb,'' Kermitterrand snaps. `` What's the point of being God, if you ca n't be in two different places at the same time, eh?'' Another memorable segment found humor in the release of the last three French hostages from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> a few days before the first round of presidential elections last May. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON>, interior minister in <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s conservative government then in office, took the credit. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was criticized on grounds he was trying to manipulate voters. `` How did you get them to release the hostages?'' one incredulous puppet asked a long-tusked walrus -LRB- <PERSON> Pasqua </PERSON> -RRB-. `` Simple,'' the walrus replied. `` I promised to give them back on Monday.'' <PERSON> Amadou </PERSON> said he never dreamed the show would be so successful. <PERSON> Kermitterrand </PERSON> has graced magazine covers, <PERSON> Babete </PERSON> watches are the latest chic souvenir and co-creator <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Roucas </PERSON>, who appears on the screen with the puppets, is stopped frequently for autographs. `` People realize more and more that politicians are conniving wheeler-dealers, on the left and the right, and we say so on the show,'' said <PERSON> Roucas </PERSON>, 36, who does the voices for all the puppets. `` The political press in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is at the service of politicians. We're saying things the way they are.'' The Bebete Show _ its title plays on the twin meanings of the word `` bete,'' stupid and animal _ is written the same day it's broadcast, taking final form in midafternoon By the time they meet, <PERSON> Amadou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roucas </PERSON> have already combed the newspapers and the jokes fly. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> recently has been following the news of an insider trading scandal that touched friends and associates of <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and forced the resignation of a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official. On the final show before a break _ it will return in late February _ <PERSON> Kermitterrand </PERSON> appeared as a machine-gun toting <PERSON> Kermitterambo </PERSON>. Furious because he could neither stop his political enemies from fueling the insider scandal nor prevent <PERSON> Amadou </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roucas </PERSON> from writing it into their script, <PERSON> Kermitterambo </PERSON> gunned them all down. Alone at last, he quickly reassured viewers. `` Do n't worry, on Feb. 27, God will bring them all back to life.''

<HEAD>Hispanic TV Networks May Commission Own Audience Ratings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FELIX GUTIERREZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Spanish-language television networks <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> are convinced they have more viewers than <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> and Arbitron ratings show, so they may pay for a special survey of Hispanic viewers. The competing networks joined last year to explore better ways of charting Hispanic viewing habits. Much is at stake, because ratings are used as a basis of negotiating advertising rates. `` I do n't think that it's any secret that the Hispanic representation of households -LRB- included in the survey samples -RRB- is far less than it should be,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON>. Both <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ratings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the leading television audience rating services, bid on a possible contract that could total $ 40 million over the next five years, said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> formed by the two networks. Tests of the Hispanic ratings could start next fall. Both ratings companies propose using `` people meters,'' hand-held devices viewers use to punch in individual code numbers as they watch television to allow tracking by age and gender. <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> have competed for Hispanic viewers with increased newscasts and new entertainment shows since 1987. They hope a tailormade rating service will come up with higher audience numbers. `` The payoff will be that we will get our share of the general market advertising budget,'' said <PERSON> Milagros </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrasquillo </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION>'s director of network research `` Right now we're less than 1 percent of the total revenue to television, and we're 8 percent of the total marketplace.'' Hispanic broadcasters have long contended differences in language, culture, and viewing habits have led to low Hispanic representation by the rating services. `` They're underreporting our core audience,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, sales manager for <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>' <ORGANIZATION> KMEX </ORGANIZATION>. He said only 17 percent of Hispanics responded to <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION>'s May ratings survey in Spanish, but station-commissioned surveys show Spanish is preferred by about 80 percent of the area's Hispanics. The rating services do n't admit they're shortchanging Spanish-language stations, pointing to bilingual materials and other adjustments. In <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION>'s November ratings for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, 19.8 percent of households were listed as Hispanic, slightly below the area's 20.7 percent Hispanic representation in the general population, a spokeswoman said. A national survey targeted at Hispanics and fine-tuned to their language and culture could produce a better picture of Hispanic viewing. But <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> research chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Peacock </PERSON> does n't think it will mean a big ratings jump for Spanish-language stations. `` The -LRB- Hispanic -RRB- market is coming of age. There is a lot more money, real or potential, at stake,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> general sales vice president in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanics number 18.5 million and their number is growing at a faster rate than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population overall, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Hispanics are projected to spend $ 141 billion in 1989, according to Hispanic Business magazine, and are being targeted by more big companies. Last year, advertisers spent $ 550 million to reach Hispanics, about 46 percent going to Spanish-language television, the magazine reported. For several years <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> has paid <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to measure Hispanic TV viewing through personal interviews. These surveys show greater numbers for Hispanic television stations than <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION>'s ratings of the same markets. <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION>'s May book showed <ORGANIZATION> KMEX </ORGANIZATION> averaged 170,000 homes in prime-time evening hours, while the Strategy Research figures estimated 470,000 homes, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` Many advertisers say Strategy Research overstates the numbers and <ORGANIZATION> Arbitron </ORGANIZATION> understates them,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>. `` There is a sizable market out there. We have to have that measured by a rating system that is accepted throughout the country.'' <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Carrasco </PERSON> called <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>'s approach `` the most effective technique that is currently available'' and said its figures are widely accepted by advertisers most familiar with the Hispanic audience.

 The syndicated travel show `` The Great Escape'' takes you to wonderful places around the world, but co-host <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> admits that everything is not quite what it seems. `` This show is geared for the consumer,'' said <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a former pro football player who is co-host with <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. `` We do n't offer vicarious travel, like ` The Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. We occasionally do an upscale place, but mostly we tell people about places they can afford to visit. A part of any successful show is knowing what your direction is. Our direction is to go to places that are easily accessible and that are good.'' So, you will rarely hear a discouraging word. `` We do n't go out of our way tosay something is bad or to be critical,'' said <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>. `` If we run into a situation we do n't like, we'll handle it by omission We're not selling out, and it's not because we're afraid of losing our tradeoff It's just that our goal is that we're looking only for the great places to visit. `` We get tradeoffs in the form of free travel and accommodations. We're up-front about that. We've got two hosts and four camera crews going all over the world and it's the only way we could afford it.'' It's common practice for television shows to accept free travel and accommodations, but federal regulations require that such arrangements be acknowledged on the air. Each weekly half-hour show visits three places: a feature destination that's usually foreign, a Discover <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> segment and a weekend escape. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> has spent a large part of the past few years on the road. First as co-host of `` Two on the Town,'' a magazine show for <ORGANIZATION> KCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and for `` The Great Escape.'' He had been a been a sportscaster after his football career. He was a wide receiver for the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bills </ORGANIZATION> and played in Super Bowl XV for the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raiders </ORGANIZATION>. He earned a law degree while playing professional football. `` For this show we're on the road 10 to 15 days, then we're home for about the same time,'' he said. `` It's tough to complain about this job. People say, ` You kidding? You get to travel everywhere.' They do n't see us packing 18 trunks of equipment, checking into a different hotel every night. I was out once last year for 27 days. We were in seven different locations.'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> said `` The Great Escape'' uses only original footage, taped around the world. The only exception was one minute of the Follies Bergere at <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. `` We get offered a lot of footage,'' said <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, `` but one of our strengths is our cameramen. We have four crews and they frequently work without a host or correspondent. Besides <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> and myself, we have used correspondents in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> go to different places so they can cover more places. `` I've been just about everywhere,'' he said, `` but when we start traveling again in March I hope we go to the Orient. The funny thing is, before this I'd only been out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> once. `` The great thing is you learn a lot about the areas. You have to do research. And when you get there you get involved with the people. You get to see a lot more than tourists do. `` I do have some favorite places,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Huka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION>. It's like an old-fashioned hunting club. There's a wonderful lake for trout fishing and you can go skiing only a few hours away. I also love the eastern coast of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> to the Great Barrier Reef. The third place is the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, from the Burgundy region and the <LOCATION> Loire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to the Mediterranean.'' Where does <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> go on vacations? `` I usually stay home,'' he said. He has two children and he and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, are expecting another child.

 When <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s savings and loan verged on collapse, it escaped a conniving financier's takeover plot with help from depositors who donated cash to help the thrift account for thousands of missing dollars. That happens only in the movies. The script from the 1940s Hollywood classic `` It's A Wonderful Life,'' starring <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> as the virtuous smalltown banker, would have to be revamped today to dramatize the frightening world of failing thrifts. While <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may eventually require depositors or taxpayers to help rescue the country's most beleaguered savings institutions, few <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Baileys </PERSON> have emerged to rally the little people. Instead, the government has embraced some of Wall Street's biggest dealmakers _ people known for multibillion-dollar buyouts and takeovers, not low-risk lending and Christmas clubs They include such names as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> tycoon <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, both ranked among Forbes magazine's richest 400 Americans In exchange for passing off the rescue effort to these financiers, the government has offered them guarantees against losses and in some cases magnanimous tax benefits. But the tradeoff is raising questions about the buyers' motives and their impact on the industry's long-term survival. `` It's very unclear whether many of these investors want to be in the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L business on an on-going basis,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriz </PERSON>, a thrift and banking analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` A number of them, no doubt, have exit strategies which call for flipping the businesses to others.'' Critics of the bailouts have implied that the low-paid bureaucrats who rushed to seal many of these deals at the end of 1988 were no match for the shrewd investors who entered bids. Some of those critics now worry that sickly thrifts could be used by their new owners as government-backed vehicles to engage in the kind of business adventurism that originally sucked the institutions into insolvency. Others believe the buyers simply saw short-term opportunities to exploit the grandiose tax benefits, which in some cases are worth more than the government's sale price of an institution. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> thrift analyst and former chief of staff at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the government's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulator, said takeover artists look at failed S & amp; Ls `` as an opportunity to make money, quite frankly Given the nature of the transactions they struck, I'm certain they're not going to do it for free.'' By far the two deals that best symbolize these concerns were the board's biggest sale, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to a group run by Bass; and the sale of five bankrupt <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts to a concern run by <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>. In the American Savings arrangement, the Bass group is putting up $ 500 million, receiving $ 1.7 billion in government aid and obtaining control of a vast network of assets worth more than $ 30 billion. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s group is putting up $ 315 million and getting $ 5.1 billion of government aid in exchange for savings units with assets of more than $ 12 billion. Bass, 40, is one of four <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> billionaire brothers, known as `` the boys,'' in their hometown <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, who control an empire of businesses that include oil wells, real estate and stocks. Over the last few years, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> has dabbled in broadcasting and publishing, with strategic investments in <ORGANIZATION> Taft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and, most recently, <ORGANIZATION> Houghton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mifflin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, 45, is known as a ruthless negotiator and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> party-circuit celebrity, whose sprawling <ORGANIZATION> MacAndrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has interests ranging from jewelry to licorice extract By far <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>'s most flamboyant acquisition has been <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION>, the cosmetics maker. He's also made unsuccessful, but lucrative, runs at <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the men's toiletry maker. Both men rarely grant interviews and have said little about their reasons for buying <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, an area in which they've had no experience. But the financiers have hired highly respected, conservative thrift managers to run the businesses, an outward indication they want them to pursue the historic strength of the thrift industry: low-risk home mortgages. That would be a welcome change from the ambitious commercial real estate lending and generous rates of interest on deposits offered by hundreds of now-insolvent thrifts, primarily in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, that resulted from deregulation in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> and his aides declined to respond to three telephone requests for comment. Bass likewise failed to respond to requests, but people familiar with his <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L venture said <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> was in it for the long term. The Bass negotiations were n't without controversy. In September he proposed creating a thrift subsidiary that would use $ 1.5 billion in assets to engage in merchant banking activities such as takeovers. The proposal created such a stir it was hastily scrapped and the merchant banking plans were scaled way back at the behest of government regulators. The Bass and <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> deals differ in a number of key ways; those differences may determine how well the two S & amp; L ventures perform and how long they survive. For one thing, Bass will get relatively few tax advantages, while <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> can apply previous losses from the thrifts as tax deductions for his other businesses. Those deductions are considered so valuable that a rival takeover strategist, <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, sued the government and <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON>, claiming his offer for the same S & amp; Ls was unfairly rejected from consideration. On the other hand, some analysts have said, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>'s acquisition has a greater chance of success over the long haul, partly because of government-imposed restrictions on the types of investments it can make. American Savings' 187 branches also provide a well-established lending network, and the government itself has a 30 percent profit-participation interest. `` American Savings is somewhat tarnished but it's not a bad one. Assuming the deal holds together from the government end, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> should do fairly well,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a thrift industry consultant. <PERSON> Ely </PERSON> dismissed much of the criticism leveled at the financiers who have purchased thrifts, saying any blame must be shared by regulators and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We can beat up on the Perelmans of the world; these guys are getting rich, and maybe they are, but only because a federal agency went into these deals and did them the way they did,'' he said.

 A posh retreat laid out more than 800 years ago for emperors awaits President and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when they come to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Feb. 25. The guesthouse has 26 rooms in its two stories and costs $ 20,000 a night for regular guests. An electric massage chair and whirlpool bath is in the main bedroom. The <ORGANIZATION> Diaoyutai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guesthouse </ORGANIZATION> stands almost as a contradiction to the austerity of today's <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` Yes, we are socialist,'' explains <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Guotong </PERSON>, one of the officials who run the place, `` but for heads of state you must have such things.'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will stay there if he accepts <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s invitation to visit this spring. So will Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> when they come in November. The 26-room guesthouse on the complex, simply called No. 18, was remodeled for <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> when she visited <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in 1986. The Chinese government pays the bill for official and state guests such as these, but others have to come up with $ 20,000 a night. <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>, which means `` fishing terrace,'' sits on 100 acres of pine groves where peacocks wander and swans grace a pond. The complex is made up of 15 large guest villas. No. 18 is the most sumptuous. From its gold-plated bathroom fixtures and silk-covered walls to its displays of ancient bronzeware and gold cloisonne, the villa radiates luxury and elitism in a grubby, gray city where egalitarianism so lately was in style. But ideology seems to stop at the gates to <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>. Even during the extreme leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, Chairman <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, relaxed in villa No. 17 by watching Western movies. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s shifting foreign policy can be charted, however, from the guest list. In 1959, when the separate villas were built, most of the guests were communist comrades. Now, Director <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaoliang </PERSON> said, most guests are Americans and Japanese. The Vietnamese revolutionary <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Chi </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON>, Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and Presidents <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were among the parade of world leaders who stayed at <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>. `` Other hotels in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> may be more convenient _ guests can come and go more freely,'' <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` But we offer quiet and security they ca n't match.'' <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION>'s telephone operators are ordered not to connect calls to guests if the caller does n't know their room number. The police who stand at attention at the compound's gates admit only cars whose license plates have been cleared in advance. For the guests, however, almost anything is possible. <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> tells a story of a guest years ago who wanted water chestnuts during the winter, when they were out of season. The guesthouse sent <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers to a nearby lake to cut through the ice and try to find some, he said `` Now we would n't do that,'' <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said. But almost. <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> sends its own trucks to the coast to pick up fresh shrimp and has special ingredients flown in from all over the country. It pays 1,000 yuan -LRB- $ 270 -RRB- a pound for a rare herb necessary for a special scallop soup. `` Hotels wo n't do that,'' <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> said. With that kind of overhead, rates start surprisingly low at $ 140 a night for a standard room. Presidential suites cost $ 500 a night. But the fanciest villas, No. 12 and No. 18, must be rented in their entirety for $ 20,000 a night. Among other recent users of No. 18 were Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON>, the American industrialist. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> are booked for Nov. 1. No. 18's presidential suite includes separate his-and-her bedrooms and bathrooms, each thickly carpeted and decorated with costly art works. `` He'' gets the electric massage chair and whirlpool bath. `` She'' gets a sunken tub with brass rails. To help cover its annual 28-million-yuan -LRB- $ 7.5-million -RRB- budget, <LOCATION> Diaoyutai </LOCATION> began selectively accepting non-VIP tourists and businessmen in 1980 and opened a club for locally based foreign businessmen last year. But non-VIPs need connections to get a room reservation. `` People ca n't come in off the street,'' said <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Guotong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON>'s deputy. The club, with a $ 40,000 membership fee, also is intended only for `` the leading people,'' <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> said. `` If a lot of people come, the air is not so fresh,'' he added, while walking through the deserted exercise room, three-lane bowling alley and billiards room. The indoor swimming pool is only four feet deep _ `` very safe'' for visiting leaders, <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> said. He paused in front of a green felt-covered table used for playing the Chinese tile game of mahjong and pushed back the pieces to reveal a mechanism that automatically lines up tiles for each new game. Mahjong in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is practically synonymous with gambling, which is illegal. Do guests gamble? `` I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> said diplomatically.

<HEAD>North Trial Comes Two Years After Disclosure of Iran-Contra Affair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 By his own account, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> would have fallen on his sword for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> more than two years ago if it were n't for the prospect of the Iran-Contra indictment which finally has gone to trial in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. Now, <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his attorneys have made clear that none of his former superiors is immune from their strategy for beating a criminal rap in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s worst scandal. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> himself may be called to the dock; only President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been excused, so far, by Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. After exhaustive investigations by a presidential commission and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, it remains to be seen whether <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, expected to last five months, will produce any startling new revelations about the bizarre sale of weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the transfer of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels. But North, armed with reams of previously undisclosed documents, has vowed a `` fight to the end'' to prove that his actions in the case were authorized by others. As far as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are concerned, neither North nor other Iran-Contra defendants could produce in the previous investigations any conclusive evidence to undermine the then-president and vice president's mutual disclaimer of any prior knowledge about the diversion of some of the Iranian arms money to the Contras, at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> forbade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to the rebels. But <PERSON> North </PERSON> repeatedly told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> he `` presumed'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> knew, and that he had sent several memos up the line from his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> desk. Others have wondered how <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who attended many meetings where the arms deal was discussed, could have been `` out of the loop,'' as he has said. North also told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the Iran-Contra caper was fully supported not only by his former immediate bosses, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, but then-CIA Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, who died on May 7, 1987, a month before <PERSON> North </PERSON> broke his silence. <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> had acknowledged the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> played a role in the shipment of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but denied knowing anything about the Contra end of the scheme. `` I was not the only one who was enthusiastic about the idea,'' said <PERSON> North </PERSON> in his <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> testimony. `` The director used many words, all effusive.'' According to North, <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> looked upon the Iran-Contra operation as just the beginning of things to come. `` He had in mind an overseas entity capable of conducting operations or activities in assistance of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign-policy goals,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said. In <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'s view, <PERSON> North </PERSON> said, it would be `` stand-alone, self-financing and independent of appropriations.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> said <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and other top administration officials wanted <PERSON> North </PERSON> to `` take the hit'' if and when the scheme unraveled. And the former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel said he was prepared to do just that _ to a point. `` I do honestly believe that they expected <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> would go quietly,'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified. `` And <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> intended to do so, right up until the day that somebody decided to start a criminal prosecution.'' It is a case which had its beginnings, not in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. And that is where it blew up in the administration's face, when a pr-Syrian magazine first reported, in early November of 1987, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>'s secret trip to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in 1985. Here is a chronology of events, according to various reports and testimony:

 While a dozen congressional committees grope publicly for ways to raise an estimated $ 85 billion to end the savings and loan crisis, the most important decisions will likely be made by a handful of players far from the television lights. Foremost, according to others involved in the process, are likely to be President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself; Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., and Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> chair, respectively, the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. These two men will be <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>'s brokers with the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on who will pay for the cleanup of the ailing industry. `` We'll hold our hearings and other committees will hold theirs, but Ways and Means will grab it in the end,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. That panel, along with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., have jurisdiction over the savings and loan industry Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> already is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s point man in the dealings with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, requesting weekly meetings with the four committee chairmen, the senior Republicans on those panels and the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s credibility was badly damaged in floating one of the major ingredients of the rescue package as a `` user fee'' on bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L depositors instead of as higher federal insurance premiums on the institutions themselves. One source close to the back-and-forth floating of ideas said <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> expects to bargain any compromise directly with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who as a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressman two decades ago served on the Ways and Means panel with <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>. The Illinois Democrat, after meeting with <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> recently, described <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s proposed 25-cent user fee on each $ 100 of deposit as `` flat as a pancake.'' He said he is concerned that whatever agreement is reached, the administration will say it was <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' doing. Briefly, here are sketches of some of the central figures in resolving the S & amp; L crisis: _ M <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, who said when he took the job 18 months ago that he was confident of resolving the industry's problems. Now he has lost the confidence of key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Republicans because of the manner in which the bank board rescued 75 institutions in December at a cost of nearly $ 20 billion to the government over the next decade. _ L <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the relatively flush fund that insures deposits in commercial banks carrying an <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> sticker on their windows. He supports the separation of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from the bank board and opposes charging banks higher insurance fees to raise money to resolve the S & amp; L problems. Some industry and government officials say <PERSON> Siedman </PERSON> wants to take over the government's deposit insurance programs covering savings and loans and credit unions as well as banks. _ <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, criticized by <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, for intervening in 1986 on behalf of savings and loan institutions in his home state It was that action, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> says, that delayed for nearly two years legislation that gave <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> an infusion of $ 10.8 billion in new money to close insolvent S & amp; Ls. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> contends he was seeking only a hearing on behalf of his constituents. His intervention is one of six allegations of wrongdoing under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. _ Sen <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a former banking committee chairman and now its senior Republican. He was the prime author _ along with ex-Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, D-R.I. and one-time chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ of the 1982 law deregulating the thrift industry Critics blame part of the current crisis on that legislation, which allowed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to expand their lending activities away from home mortgages into more risky commercial ventures. _ <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a 72-year-old outspoken maverick who succeeded <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> as the banking committee chairman after <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> was defeated last November <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> wants to separate <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, which insures accounts in thrift institutions, from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the government's umbrella agency for S & amp; L regulation. He is sympathetic, however, to the plight of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the center of the industry's insolvency. _ <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, a one-time <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> with one of the most liberal records in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> He is a relative neophyte on savings and loan issues despite 12 years on the banking committee. While he has been unsympathetic to allowing banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to venture into new areas of investment, he says it would be `` an enormous shift backwards'' to require thrift institutions to return to what was once their prime line of business _ home mortgages. _ <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, whose home state is at the heart of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis, has called the depositor fee proposal `` really very foolish. As chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will wield considerable influence over any eventual solution to the S & amp; L crisis.

<TEXT>
 It was a bank examiner's nightmare: an electronic run at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, the nation's largest insolvent S & amp; L a year ago. Big depositors, worried that the long-troubled institution was on the verge of toppling, sent wire orders yanking out nearly half a billion dollars in the first two months of 1988 alone. Regulators ended the nightmare with a few soothing words. They waved a magic wand called deposit insurance. The episode symbolizes both the great strength and the underlying weakness of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system of insuring bank and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits, a system created half a century ago as part of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s New Deal Bank run. The very words make financial regulators queasy and evoke Depression-era memories of long lines of depositors anxiously clutching savings passbooks. But the run at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> was straight from the high-tech'80s. There were no mobs pressing at the institution's doors; only clacking computer terminal keys and whirring magnetic discs as money brokers withdrew their wealthy clients' cash Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that regulates nearly 3,000 federally insured S & amp; Ls, stopped the run in mid-March with the simple announcement that they would protect all depositors, even those with accounts exceeding the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 100,000 limit. Ironically, the deposit insurance that saved the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L also helped create the industry's mess. The insurance allows savings and loan owners to put up a little of their own money, take in a lot of deposits and gamble on risky loans, potentially at the taxpayers' expense That's what occurred with American Savings and Loan. Once a conservative mortgage lender, new management took over in 1983 and embarked on a program of rapid growth and aggressive real estate lending. Bad loans grew and last December the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> had to pay $ 1.7 billion to have the institution taken over by a new owner. If deposit insurance is part of the problem, it has also been a source of security for millions and the only thing that has staved off disaster for people who found that the repositories of their life savings had gone under. ` People have an almost mystical degree of confidence in the federal sticker on the wall,'' says <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON>, a banking expert at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> think tank. `` Even though the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> is insolvent, they believe the government can come up with the money somehow. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just told them that.'' One week into his term, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made a point in his nationally televised news conference of reassuring S & amp; L customers. Deposits in the nation's S & amp; Ls `` are sound, they are good ... nothing is going to change in that regard,'' the president said. How, then, did a once sleepy, seemingly secure industry come to the point that it needed presidential pronouncements to steady its customers' nerves? How did it sink so low that regulators would pledge $ 31 billion to rescue 205 institutions in 1988 and still have 350 insolvent, but still open, institutions to babysit? The seeds of the ailment have been buried deep within from the start. They lay in the inherent instability of borrowing short -LRB- from depositors -RRB- and lending long -LRB- to home buyers for 20 or 30 years -RRB-. That was fine during the long economic boom and stable interest rates that followed World War II. S & amp; L executives lived by the 3-6-3 rule: Take in deposits at 3 percent interest, lend the money to home buyers at 6 percent and hit the golf course by 3 p.m. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the industry's underpinnings had become wobbly Inflation was soaring into double digits and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> responded by pushing interest rates past 20 percent. Money poured out of the thrifts, with their low interest rates, and into high-yield money market mutual funds offered by brokerage firms. By 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> felt it had little choice but to lift the 5.5 percent cap on interest paid to S & amp; L depositors or watch thrift institutions shrivel. At the same time, the limit on federal insurance was raised from $ 40,000 to $ 100,000 per account. Then, two year later, new laws gave thrift owners fresh investment opportunities: commercial and consumer loans, construction lending and direct investments in development projects. The idea was that diversification would give <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls a chance to enter more lucrative fields and grow less dependent on the roller coaster housing market. Regulators also lifted rules limiting brokered deposits to 5 percent of the total. Brokers divy up the money of wealthy clients and institutions into $ 100,000 chunks, parceling them out to institutions paying the highest rates. Some thrifts thrived in the new climate, but many did n't have the experience to succeed and saw their portfolios grow ever more shaky. Even more bedeviling were laws lying dormant in states such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> giving thrifts power to make risky investments. As long as the federal interest rate cap and the limit on brokered deposits remained in place, institutions could n't attract enough deposits to get into risky areas in a big way After 1982, that changed. Enter a new breed of player: the high flier. Men like <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McBirney </PERSON>, who purchased small, staid institutions such as <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s Vernon Savings and Loan and <PERSON> McBirney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and both later bailed out for billions of dollars These new owners opened up the phone lines, scooped up brokered deposits and shoveled the money into risky construction and development projects. Along the way they lived well and made powerful political friends such as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McBirney </PERSON> threw lavish parties at his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> home, serving exotic game and dressing servants in costume. He flew important customers on a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> junket in a borrowed jet. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> lent his yacht, High Spirits, to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coehlo </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, for lucrative Democratic fund-raisers. The party lasted until 1986, when oil prices collapsed. Across <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, real estate projects begun on projections of $ 70-a-barrel oil fell apart. Borrowers defaulted but the collateral they turned over was now worth only a fraction of what they owed. Regulators estimate that about half of the nation's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L problem is centered in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and other oil states. As the comptroller of the currency, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, says of bank failures, `` When the economic tide goes out, you find out who is swimming naked.'' And while more and more S & amp; Ls were becoming financially shaky, the government had fewer cops _ <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> examiners _ on the beat. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's budget office rebuffed <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, then chairman of the bank board, when he pleaded for money to hire more and better-qualified examiners. In 1985, he did some administrative maneuvering, freeing the examination force from White House budget controls. He raised examiners' salaries and by last year the force had doubled.

 <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> also began the process of requiring S & amp; L owners to put more of their own money into their institutions. By 1991, the capital requirement will be 6 percent. Previous regulators had relaxed the requirement from 5 percent to 3 percent, seeing the move as a way to give struggling thrifts greater latitude to work out their problems. In the end, it just created an incentive to gamble because <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners had less of their own money at risk. Economists call it `` moral hazard.'' In fact, owners of the 350 insolvent institutions still open have nothing left to lose, a situation ripe for fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> says fraud contributes significantly to 20 percent of all S & amp; L failures and plays some part in 70 percent as managers swing for the bleachers in an attempt to hit a financial home run and prevent bankruptcy. While the bank board's push for tougher capital rules and supervision will help prevent future problems, it came too late to head off today's crisis. By 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> was broke. Early that year, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposed selling bonds to raise $ 15 billion and then assessing <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to pay off the bonds. The industry's biggest trade association, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, one of the most effective lobbies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, balked and found a good deal of sympathy on <LOCATION> Captiol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> thought of thrift executives, the image was not of <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and <PERSON> McBirney </PERSON>, but of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, the small town, idealistic building and loan officer played by <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> in the 1946 movie classic `` It's A Wonderful Life.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> dithered and finally, in August 1987, authorized $ 10.8 billion in industry-funded borrowing. By then, almost everyone knew that would be only a down payment. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional auditing agency, estimates it will cost $ 85 billion to close or merge all the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls _ roughly $ 500 for every taxpayer in the nation. `` If you roll back the clock -LRB- to -RRB- five years ago, this was a $ 10 billion to $ 20 billion problem,'' said <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` If we had shut them down then, we would n't have a $ 100 billion problem today.'' In the meantime, the bank board has been selling insolvent S & amp; Ls to new owners, using as little government cash as possible. It handled 205 last year _ a post-Depression record. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board members say they do n't have the money to simply shut down S & amp; Ls and pay off the depositors and that it's better to arrange a rescue than to let an insolvent institution hemorrhage further. But private analysts say such deals, some of which offer large tax benefits to the new owners, may come back to haunt the government by requiring a second and more expensive generation of rescues. Typically, a large part of the bank board's assistance is in the form of a promissory note, on which it pays the acquiring institution interest. At year's end, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> had $ 20.3 billion in such notes outstanding. In 1988 alone, the agency issued $ 14.5 billion in the bonds. The government is also guaranteeing owners of rescued S & amp; Ls against loss on the existing loan portfolio. `` The risks to the government are unlimited,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> McKinsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Now, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> are struggling to raise $ 85 billion to $ 100 billion to deal with the remaining 350 insolvent thrifts, to pay off the promissory notes and make good on the loss guarantees <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have told members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> they will propose another bond issue. The difficulty comes in deciding where to get the $ 7 billion to $ 9 billion a year to pay off the bonds. There are basically three choices, all painful: _ Depositors could pay through a fee, but that could send money pouring out of federally insured institutions and into money market funds _ The institutions themselves could pay, but that means either further erosion of fragile profit margins or depositors end up paying through a lower return on their savings, which in turn could also send them to money market funds _ The taxpayer could pay, but that would either cut President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s already slim chances of keeping his `` no new taxes'' pledge or mean deep cuts in other government programs Meanwhile, troubles are n't over for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, which lost a post-Depression record of $ 9.4 billion in the first nine months of 1988. For one thing, the once-hot Northeast real estate market is cooling, a potentially ominous sign for that region. For another, interest rates have been heading higher since last spring, threatening to recreate on a smaller scale the interest rate spread problems of a decade ago that got thrifts into trouble in the first place. Moreover, the debate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over how to solve the problem of insolvent S & amp; Ls may in itself be making the situation worse as the public becomes increasingly aware of the problem. `` The fear and uncertainty are growing with each succeeding article. ... It's a real land mine,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. `` If consumers get it in their heads that ` I'm going to play it safe and put my money under my pillow,' you have a real problem that you're not going to stop very easily,'' he said. Public officials, including the president, need to drive home again and again that the debate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is over the best way to raise the money to end the crisis, not over whether to protect the deposits, he said. Along with finding the money, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must also look at some sort of `` never again'' reforms guaranteeing that the government will not be asked again to bail out the S & amp; L industry. There is some sentiment for turning back the clock, returning thrifts to their traditional role of home mortgage lending and steering them out of speculative commercial ventures. However, that ignores that overspecialization in housing is at the root of the industry's trouble. Private analysts say it's both too late and unwise to return to the days of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> Falls Building and Loan. `` Thrift viability in the long run is threatened by a return to traditional mortgage lending, which according to my research has not shown a profit in five years,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carron </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The bank board has already moved toward a number of key reforms _ bigger capital cushions and more vigorous regulatory supervision _ and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> likely will reinforce that in some way. As to administrative changes, the bank board is almost sure to lose some of its independence and may lose control over its insurance fund.

<HEAD>Britain Losing Art Treasures to Spiraling Market Prices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is in danger of losing many important art works _ some hanging in hallowed halls for centuries _ because national museums ca n't match the high prices offered by foreign buyers, art critics say. One such work is <ORGANIZATION> Mappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION>, a 13th-century world map on vellum that is one of the country's greatest medieval treasures. It now is held by the <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to put it up for auction in June because it needs money for extensive building repairs. Some experts say the work could fetch 2.5 million pounds _ $ 4.4 million at recent exchange rates. In 1952, the government set up a `` safety net'' in an effort to keep important art treasures in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Under the plan, export licenses are required for objects more than 50 years old and, in most cases, worth more than 16,000 pounds -LRB- $ 28,000 -RRB-. But if an object is more than 50 years old and also has been in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for 50 years or more, a panel of experts is called in. If the experts conclude the item should stay in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a government reviewing committee can delay its export for up to six months while museums try to match the buyer's price. Works are judged by their aesthetic, historic and scholarly importance. One painting that met all three criteria was `` Self-Portrait as Saint Matthew'' by the Dutch artist <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyck </PERSON>. It had hung in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> for centuries and went on sale in 1987. The experts concluded that its departure would be a great loss to the nation. But no British museum could match the price of 430,000 pounds -LRB- then $ 785,000 -RRB- offered by a foreigner. The painting then was shipped to its new owner in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, identified only as <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>. Another such setback may be in store this year. `` Seascape Folkestone'' by the famous landscape painter J.M.W. Turner -LRB- 1775-1851 -RRB- sold in 1984 to an anonymous private buyer for a British record of 7.3 million pounds -LRB- $ 10 million -RRB-. Not until recently was an export license applied for. Since no museum has been able to match the record price, the export license is expected to be issued soon. Art critics say the problem derives partly from spiraling market prices that have placed some works out of reach of all but the Gettys of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Japanese, the latest rising force on the international art market. But many critics increasingly blame the Conservative government of Prime Minster <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for failing to help local museums keep pace. They suggest that government strategies for keeping treasures at home are n't working. The rising prices appeal to private collectors faced with high inheritance taxes or rising costs of maintaining stately homes. Universities and similar institutions are tempted to sell their art collections because of government budget cuts. The likelihood that the <ORGANIZATION> Mappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION> will wind up overseas has prompted one member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> to propose an outright ban on exporting some objects. Government officials acknowledge that British rules are among the most flexible in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but they argue that tightening them would stifle an export market than brings $ 2.1 billion a year to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` The system ... to safeguard this country's treasures is coming dangerously close to being a pointless sham,'' <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Somers-Cocks </PERSON>, editor of the respected art monthly `` Apollo,'' wrote in a recent editorial, `` The Collapsing Safety Net.'' It was time, she said, for the government to decide `` whether we are at all serious about trying to keep great works of art in this country.'' The export review system created in 1952 endeavored to balance the art market's needs with that of the nation's, art critic <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Conru </PERSON> wrote in a survey of the systems used by more than 50 other nations. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, he said, has a reputation for having `` arbitrary and unpredictable'' rules, which auctioneers believe have inhibited trade; the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> bans entire collections from foreign ownership. Nowadays, major museums simply ca n't afford to compete with the big foreign buyers. The Getty Museum in <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for instance, spends more each year on purchases than the combined purchasing budgets of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 13 state museums. <PERSON> Conru </PERSON> and others say the export review system, one of the first of its kind in the world, now is in need of reappraisal. In 1986-87, the government reviewing committee considered 26 objects and delayed the export of 15. Eight of them, worth a total of $ 2.6 million, stayed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The other seven, worth $ 60 million, went abroad. Those that went abroad included Old Masters drawings, from the <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION> stately home, whose export was `` one of the greatest artistic losses to this country this century,'' the committee noted. In the last year, 12 objects worth $ 18 million were saved, while a dozen worth $ 14 million went abroad. Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON>, director of the only private `` art charity'' helping public collections, says the small number of objects reviewed indicates something is wrong. `` The great bulk of art objects are flowing out without any restraint at all,'' he said in an interview. Ms. <PERSON> Somers-Cocks </PERSON> says the expert advisers tend to lack vigilance, knowing that `` their efforts will be useless'' since the museums lack the money to buy objects back. Museum purchase grants, many smaller than the cost of a single Impressionist painting nowadays, have been frozen since 1982 and will remain so until 1991. Arts Minister <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON> has agreed to review the grant system, although not necessarily to strengthen it, said the government's Office of Arts and Libraries The money shortage has increased the burden on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two main art funding groups, <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON>'s private National Art-Collections Fund and the larger, quasi-governmental National Heritage Memorial Fund. The latter, created in 1980, has spent more than 100 million pounds -LRB- $ 175 million -RRB- saving important art objects. But art accounts only for a fraction of its work, which ranges from coastal scenery to endangered butterflies and stately homes. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a fund trustee, says the fund so far has not failed to save an important object from being exported. But this year, he said in an interview, `` if things go on increasing in price and number as they have, then the collision course between demand and lack of funds is likely to come.'' <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manuscripts </ORGANIZATION>, has called for a ban on exporting objects like the <ORGANIZATION> Mappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION>, but doubts it will happen. Memorial Fund Chairman Lord <PERSON> Charteris </PERSON> opposes a ban. `` One of the beauties of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is that it's the center of the art trade and I would n't want that changed,'' he said. `` Still, I'm worried about the future.

<HEAD>Bush and Administration Both Finding Voices</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a long-running serial with no final installment, every president tries to find a formula that will produce a smooth, mutually satisfactory system for dealing with the White House press. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers have been working on it, and there already is some sniping from an institution that probably is impossible to satisfy. Reporters always will have another question and presidents wo n't always answer. That conflict is built into their jobs. It can be controlled but it ca n't be eliminated. Before laryngitis temporarily stilled his voice, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> held an informal press conference his first day in office, then a pooled interview, then a 43-minute televised news conference. Critics in the media promptly complained that reporters had n't been tough enough in their questions and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had n't been specific enough in his answers Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> held a briefing for reporters the other day and stirred a micro-controversy because he would n't be quoted by name. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked White House reporters to advise him on press conference ground rules but got no clear answer. There's a message in all this: Accessibility does not guarantee satisfaction. Access was an issue, and a valid complaint, when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was waging his winning campaign. There was virtually none because his managers were determined to keep control of the news agenda. But during the transition, and in his first weeks as president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proven far more accessible than <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ever was. There is a tradeoff. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> formula precludes questions shouted on the White House lawn, or at picture-taking sessions or, as of Wednesday night, by pool reporters representing the rest of the press at <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> social events. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took questions at such events but seldom provided meaningful information. Nevertheless, that made him appear accessible to questioning newsmen. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he'd provide opportunities for meaningful questions in place of the shouted ones. The news, of course, is not in the questions anyhow. It is in the answers. The willingness of presidents to meet with reporters and answer their questions varies with circumstances. In the best of times, most presidents are very accessible. In the worst, they usually avoid questions. <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> sometimes seemed bent on non-stop news conferences, indoors and out, until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> policy became an overriding and tormenting issue. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> clammed up during the scandal that ended his presidency, save for periodic news conferences he convened to protest his innocence and say that one, then two years of Watergate was enough. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s low access became just about no access while the Iran-Contra scandal was unfolding. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> openness will face its real trial when something goes badly wrong. That latest <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> controversy, hardly a blip compared with those that hit him during the campaign, came when he took part in a background briefing for reporters who covered his three-day trip to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Such briefings are traditional prior to presidential and vice presidential travels. They usually are conducted by members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff and by <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> experts on the areas involved. They speak on condition that they be identified only as administration officials. The briefings cover logistics and explain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in the areas involved. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeared at the briefing on his own trip, but could n't be identified by the reporters who attended. He could and was by reporters who did not attend, and the background rules drew criticism. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is n't the first top-level traveler to take a hand in a trip briefing. Presidents sometimes have done so themselves. At the same time, the incident teaches one of the lessons of politics at the top. If it's said, it might as well be said on the record, because background rules, even off-the-record strictures are must about impossible to keep. <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> learned that the hard way in 1971, after a midnight conversation in a <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, hotel suite. He invited a handful of reporters there for a nightcap, conversed off the record for an hour or so _ and expressed misgivings about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overtures toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was just beginning the process that restored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties to the Communist mainland. The vice president's comments did n't stay off the record for long _ they found a way into print the next day

 Wealthy Sir <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> was murdered in 1943 at his home in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> during an apparent voodoo ritual, and, although the scandal reached the level of the Duke and Duchess of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, his killer is still unknown. Not that there was a lack of suspects. They ranged from his son-in-law to the Mafia, from gamblers angered by his opposition to their plans for casinos in the islands to a rabble-rousing native revolutionary. The murder of <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> and the cast of suspects, detectives and royalty might have been put together by <PERSON> Agatha </PERSON> <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>. But the story is true and is told in the four-hour, two-part miniseries `` Passion and Paradise,'' which airs Sunday and Tuesday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The murder was very big in the headlines,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who plays <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>' daughter, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. `` People were very anxious to read anything that would take their minds off World War II.'' <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Marigny </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Assante </PERSON>, was a major suspect in the murder. He was penniless and reputedly had been a gigolo. `` He was a playboy who had married several wealthy women,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. `` When he started hanging out with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, the immediate suspicion was that he was after the money. Her parents were totally opposed to the marriage. He and the father were alike in some ways and even advised each other. But my husband felt my father had too much control over me. `` It's a fascinating story and what attracted me to <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> is that she's such a complex character. She starts out as a teen-ager, raised in this protected environment in paradise. She's bored and when she meets this man of the world he sweeps her off her feet. Apparently it was a very passionate relationship.'' Despite the title, <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> was an American who had made a fortune as a gold miner in the Klondike. He moved to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> to take advantage of its lenient tax laws. The miniseries was filmed in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> directed from a screenplay by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Laskos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mariette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> is his wife. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarrazin </PERSON> is an island gangster, and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> is a real estate dealer. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> plays <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Schindler </PERSON>, an American detective called in to investigate the murder. `` Schindler was a detective <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> brought in because he had been a friend of her father's,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. `` He's not your typical private eye. He was frumpy, rumpled, a lot like Lt. <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> played him as rather sarcastic. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> himself is the king of bad jokes. He was always telling these terrible jokes. `` I was with some real pros. In a courtroom scene, all we had to do was sit there and react. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mariette </PERSON> and I. Watching these people perform, I got so distracted, I was dead in the water. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> would cough and pull at his hankerchief, then turn and look around. <PERSON> Mariette </PERSON> was doing all her little things. It was magnetic.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said she was pleased that she was openly welcomed by the other actors. `` They made me feel a part of the group,'' she said. `` So often you work with older stars and they keep to themselves.'' She said working opposite <PERSON> Assante </PERSON> helped her performance. `` He's a very disciplined actor,'' she said `` He kept me on my toes. You ca n't let up when you work with <PERSON> Armand </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON>' murder occurred while the Duke of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> was governor of the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. The scandal, including a police conspiracy, reached into his government. But mainly he is pictured as inept. When the scandal heated up, the <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duchess </PERSON> left the islands to avoid the publicity. `` The legal investigation was very shoddy,'' said <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> hired a couple of detectives from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who already had very bad reputations. That's why <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> took it upon herself to hire an investigator. The murder was made to look like a voodoo ritual. There were bloody handprints on the walls and chicken feathers everywhere. The bed had been burned. `` The next day the murder scene had been cleaned up. All the evidence was removed. The only fingerprint found was <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>'s husband's, but that was suspect There were so many loose ends, even today.'' One theory was that <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> had been killed because he was blocking legalized gambling in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Mafia gangsters wanted to expand their profitable casinos in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Immediately after his death gambling was approved for the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and the largest casino of all was built on the site of his mansion.

 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s last day in office was quiet, the White House press room mostly empty. But <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> had not given up even though it was his last day, too. `` Let's see what's in the driveway,'' he said, and trotted outside into the bright sunshine of the crisp January morning. `` That's one of the things I told Brit -LRB- <PERSON> Hume </PERSON>, his successor -RRB-. If you hang around outside, you see a lot of things.'' But there was nothing to see, even though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had conducted an East Room ceremony and a small motorcade was lined up in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION> parking lot. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> stood on a curb, shielding his eyes against the glare of the sun, and searched for signs of the principals. Two White House guards walked by, amused. `` There's <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> on a stakeout,'' said one, laughing. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> moved to another vantage point opposite the door to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION>. A vague smile seemed to drift across the face of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard stationed at the entrance as <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> strained on tiptoes and shouted at the empty doorway, `` Come out! Come out!'' He finally gave up. The prevailing mood in the White House seemed to be boredom. In the press room, there was nostalgia: it was the end of `` the <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> administration.'' <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, 54, had been <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s chief White House correspondent for 12 years and was leaving the beat for a new, prime-time news program scheduled to debut later this year. During his White House years, especially during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> became synonymous in the public mind with the pushy reporter. It was <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> who most often shouted questions at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from the press corral during public appearances. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>'s shouting seemed to many viewers rude, unseemly, disrespectful. For some right-wing columnists, <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> even became shorthand for what they saw as a biased, liberal, Eastern press. `` The height of this,'' recalled <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, sitting on the curb of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION> drive, came shortly after the Republican convention; reporters were with then-vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in his hometown, <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. `` And there was this sort of confrontation as he tried to answer reporters' questions. People, I'm told, were booing me _ ` Go on <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>! Go home! Get out of here, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>!' `` I was n't there. I was n't within a thousand miles of there. I do n't think there's anyone who looks like me, and vice versa. So you see, the reaction was simply to find my name and use my name as a symbol. `` I do not welcome this,'' he said. `` I will be delighted as this recedes. `` But I understood it, because these people who loved <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a political hero would condemn me and other reporters. And because of my nature and my visible platform, particularly the -LRB- <PERSON> David </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> show's roundtable, it was easier to find me than <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Plante </PERSON> or <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> or somebody else. I'd also been here longer. `` I put it to you this way. Yes, I'm aggressive by nature, and I do not believe in the adage, ` One should be seen but not heard.' `` No one ever heard me yell at <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. ... Because it was unnecessary. To talk to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, except in the last few years of his presidency when he hunkered down over the hostage crisis, he was available. `` For <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the alternatives were go for months, or speak out, and if, as they always did when he was in public, keep him 50 yards away, to speak out meant that you had to raise your voice. I trust from what we know about him, no one will have to yell at <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. But what I'm saying, I've used whatever tools I felt I needed at the time to do my job as a television reporter, no more _ but no less.'' If he raised the ire of viewers, <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> earned the respect of his colleagues, despite a healthy ego that once prompted <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Schram </PERSON> to observe that if there were no such thing as television, `` <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> would go door to door.'' <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Socolow </PERSON>, former executive producer of the rival `` CBS Evening News,'' says <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> `` served a very important function _ insisting on openness in a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that increasingly tried to close up.'' `` Everybody fought that battle,'' <PERSON> Socolow </PERSON> said, `` but <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> was always up there unremitting, uncompromising, two-fisted, fighting for everybody.'' `` I had a negative impression of him before I went to the White House,'' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Santini </PERSON>, who has covered the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for 10 years, first for the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and now for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` Once I got there and met him and got to know him a little bit, I totally changed my impression. I've seen that happen time after time after time. People get to know him and realize he's this delightful character. It was <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, she said, who most often stood up for the other reporters' rights. `` When -LRB- presidential spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> was there, <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON>' style of dealing with the press was to pit everybody against each other,'' she said `` He would make fun of the person asking the question, and his ridicule was really very cruel oftentimes. It used to anger me that the press corps would just sit there and let him do that to one of us. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> is one of the few people who on occasion would come to someone's defense.'' ABC News last week signed <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> to be co-anchor with <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> on the new program, as yet untitled. Looking forward to the new assignment seemed to have muted any sentimentality <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> might have felt on his last day at the White House. `` I want to go. I've wanted to go now for some time,'' he said. `` If you were to say to me, ` You're going to walk out that gate, and you're never going to do anything again that's going to be as interesting or as important in your business,' yeah, I'd be upset. But I do n't think that's the case.'' Nevertheless, as he roamed the White House on his last day, colleagues and staffers continually told him how much they would miss him. `` I'm not leaving ABC News!'' he insisted in response. As he checked in at the tiny <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> booth in the far corner of the White House press room, correspondent <PERSON> Lark </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> informed him that the crew out on the lawn was demanding that he come out for a rehearsal of an exchange with anchor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said they would have to wait. `` Tell them,'' he said, `` they can fire me as White House correspondent if they do n't like it!''

 New home sales edged up a meager 0.9 percent last year, the government said in a report analysts cited as evidence that higher mortgage interest rates continue to dampen activity in the housing market. Sales for all of 1988 totaled 677,000 dwellings, up from 671,000 sold during the previous year, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. Home sales had plunged 10.5 percent in 1987, with the drop blamed on rising interest rates and a slowdown in demand after five strong sales years. Fixed-rate mortgages last week stood at 10.6 percent, up from 10.16 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market bounced back and forth aimlessly Thursday as traders awaited the first statistical gauge of how the economy started off 1989, the January unemployment rate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.46 to 2,333.75. The dollar finished mixed against major foreign currencies in listless trading. Gold prices slipped. Bond prices were little changed in slow activity. Orange juice futures prices turned decisively lower; precious metals futures resumed their slide; grains and soybeans moved lower; energy futures and livestock futures were mixed.

<HEAD>Retailers Ring Up Good January Sales</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Consumers shopping for discounts at general merchandise and apparel stores in January probably were disappointed _ inventories were so tight after Christmas that many merchants did n't have to mark down prices to clear out goods. The nation's largest retailers on Thursday reported they had good sales gains last month, but some industry analysts speculated that if stores had more merchandise to sell, their January volume might have been better. This trend may continue. Retailers were still wary about demand prospects when they placed their orders for the next several months, so their stock will remain low. `` Consumers looking for heavy markdowns may be disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a retail specialist with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I do n't think you will see them in the spring 1989 season either.'' Goods were sharply depleted during December as business surpassed expectations. Also, stores did n't have much merchandise left over after Christmas because they had held inventories in check to avoid having to run clearance sales with drastic price cuts. Unseasonably warm weather throughout much of the country probably encouraged people to go out shopping last month, analysts said. By far, the brightest spot in the industry was women's apparel. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said apparel retailers have enjoyed a resurgence over the past few months and will probably continue to benefit from women's favorable reactions to the more conservative styles now in the stores. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Prescott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Turben </LOCATION>, believes higher outlays for women's clothes will lead the turnaround in general merchandise spending. People will steer a larger share of their spendable income toward general merchandisers and away from autodealers, for instance. As he put it, `` Women have stopped sitting on their hands.'' <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest specialty apparel retailer, reported a 34 percent jump in overall sales last month, while sales at stores open at least a year _ known as same-store sales in the industry _ rose 28 percent. Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a more accurate measure of a company's performance than figures that include sales from new stores. Analysts recommended against attaching too much significance to the tallies because January is the least important month on the industry's calendar. `` January is such an insignificant month. January's a cleanup month after Christmas. If you had a couple of good days, that makes a big difference,'' observed <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Moreover, several store executives and analysts explained that at least part of the percentage increase reflected the fact that this January's sales were being compared to last year's fairly anemic amounts. Analysts expressed optimism about the retailers' earnings for the fourth quarter of their fiscal year, which for many of them ended January 28. The financial results are due out later this month. Among the major retailers reporting Thursday, the nation's largest, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its overall sales rose 11.4 percent in January and 7.3 percent for its entire fiscal year Its same-store sales were up 6.2 percent for the month and 3.4 percent over the course of the year. K mart <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 6.9 percent in January and 6.5 percent over the year. Its same-store sales rose 2.5 percent last month and 2.8 percent for the full year. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s overall sales rose 30 percent last month and 29 percent for the year. The discount retailer's same-store sales rose 13 percent in January and 12 percent for the year. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> posted a 2.4 percent gain for January and a decline of 0.1 percent over the year The company's same-store sales rose 0.2 percent last month while falling 1.8 percent for the year. The decline in <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s sales occurred in part because the company discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year. <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a big department store owner, reported a 15.2 percent overall sales gain in January and a 14.4 percent rise for the full year. Its same-store stores rose 9.4 percent in the month and 3.1 percent in the year. May <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s January sales rose 25.8 percent and full-year sales rose 18.9 percent. Same-store sales rose 7.6 percent last month and 3.7 percent last year. F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales increased 12.2 percent in January and 12.3 percent in the 12 months. Same-store sales rose 6 percent in the month and 6.4 percent in the year. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported an 8.3 percent January sales increase and a 4.6 percent rise for the year. It did not provide same-store sales figures. Despite strong results in December and January, many stores were unable to keep place with inflation during the year. For all of 1988, inflation grew at a rate of 4.4. percent The results reported were from the biggest general merchandise and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced its second foreign joint venture this week, an estimated $ 500 million deal with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> to build a four-wheel drive sport vehicle code-named `` JJ.'' The deal, announced Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, heralds the first European production for the nation's No. 2 automaker in more than a decade. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also said it posted a 23.8 percent fourth-quarter earnings increase, although annual profits for 1988 shrank 18.6 percent, and announced its workers would receive $ 720 in profit-sharing this year. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said joint production of the JJ, called a `` mini-sport utility vehicle,'' was scheduled to begin in July 1992 at an existing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant and one in either <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The Jeep-like vehicle would cost under $ 10,000, he said. `` You look at it and it's a ` wow' car,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week announced it would market autos made in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, beginning in 1991. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said the 50-50 venture with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s state-owned automaker aims to sell 100,000 vehicles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 50,000 in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the companies' contribution to the deal would total about $ 500 million. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will handle North American sales while <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> will be responsible for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also said hourly and salaried workers would receive profit-sharing payments averaging about $ 720 in March. The payments would be the company's first under a profit-sharing agreement signed last year with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> late last year announced profit-sharing of about $ 200 per employee. Officials at No. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are expected to announce profit-sharing well over $ 1,000 per worker. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> closed at $ 28.50, down 37 -LCB- cents a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Thursday. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> also renewed his argument that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should impose a 25 percent tariff on all imported trucks, including minivans and sport-utility vehicles. Some foreign automakers slightly modify vehicles to classify them as cars, such as the popular minivans, and thereby have to pay only a 2.5 percent tariff. <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> have called on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> to slap the truck tariff on light-utility vehicles. `` If it looks like a truck and walks like a truck and acts like a truck, then it's a truck,'' <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> reported a profit of $ 433.6 million, or $ 1.85 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31. That compared with earnings of $ 350.2 million, or $ 1.57 a share, in fourth quarter 1987. Revenue totaled $ 9.69 billion, up 13.6 percent from $ 8.53 billion in the corresponding 1987 quarter. For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 1.05 billion, or $ 4.66 cents a share, down 18.6 percent from $ 1.29 billion, or $ 5.90 a share in 1987. Annual revenue rose to $ 35.5 billion from $ 29.3 billion the previous year. The 1988 results were reduced by $ 93.1 million due to a $ 150 million charge for previously announced plant closings in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Acustar </ORGANIZATION> parts subsidiary <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> said annual results also were affected by the company's strategy to increase market share by reducing some auto prices and offering sales incentives <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck market rose to 14 percent from 12.3 percent in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it sold 2.21 million vehicles _ the first time it sold a million cars and a million trucks in the same year _ compared with 1.92 million in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the automaker's financing arm, reported a fourth - quarter profit of $ 74 million, up from $ 60 million a year earlier For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 259 million, up from $ 226 million in 1987. Automakers and analysts have predicted 1988 would be the industry's best earnings year ever, with the Big Three posting combined profits of $ 11 billion. The previous record was the combined $ 9.8 billion profit in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are expected to release their fourth-quarter earnings in mid-February.

So frequent have been the layoffs and start-ups, union officials said Thursday, that many of the 2,100 workers are skeptical about <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that the plant will shut down indefinitely in August. `` They're still in a wait-and-see mode,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grniet </PERSON>, a 24-year veteran of the plant. `` Because there have been so many layoffs, the perception in everyone's mind is that, ` I'll get called back.''' But <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> officials and industry analysts threw cold water on that perception Thursday. `` I'd say the chances of that plant reopening are very low, because <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> still has too much production capacity,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Laughlin </PERSON>, who follows the automaker for the Wall Street investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The plant, built in 1948, assembles two of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s A-body cars, the <LOCATION> Oldsmobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cutlass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ciera </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION>. It was hit by temporary shutdowns, ranging from a few weeks to several months, in 1977, 1981, 1982 and 1987. Adding to workers' optimism that this shutdown, too, will prove to be temporary was the wording of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement. The automaker said it would `` idle the plant for an indefinite period,'' rather than shut it down permanently. But that wording in fact was dictated largely by the company's contract with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which prevents it from permanently shutting most factories <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> sought Thursday to underline that the coming shutdown differs fundamentally from earlier ones. `` The real difference is that in the past, when the plant has had to be shut down or a shift taken off, it's been because of a temporary volume related adjustment,'' he said. This time, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has decided to reduce its productive overcapacity and bring down costs by building A-cars only at its plants in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Therese </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> <PERSON> Aripze </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Those plants, which already build A-cars, can easily meet the demand for the Olds Cutlass, <ORGANIZATION> Buick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> and other models in 1990 and beyond, he said. `` What that means is, we do n't have a product to build in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> anymore. That's very different from the simple volume adjustments that we've had to make in the past,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>'s board of selectmen, said Thursday he was optimistic <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> would eventually decide to build some other models in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was skeptical about that, too. `` It is n't as if there is a shelf with a lot of products and all you have to do is get someone to give you one,'' he said. `` There are n't those products out there.'' The plant's high point in recent years came in August 1987, when <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> invested $ 240 million in a new paint shop. Until this week's announcement, the low point was in November 1987, when the plant shut down indefinitely, laying off 3,700 workers. It reopened last May with the current 2,100 employees, more than half of whom have 20 years or more of service. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> refused to explain why <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> chose to close the <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> operation rather than one of the other three A-car plants. `` Each facility has certain advantages and disadvantages _ some are material, some are physical, some have to do with human factors. You have to weigh all of those things when you make one of these decisions,'' he said. `` GM is not going to discuss the specific reasons behind its evaluation of a facility.''

<TEXT>
 The investigation into alleged fraud at the nation's major futures markets may have doomed the time-honored and lucrative practice of dual trading on at least one of the exchanges, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified sources as saying <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> officials are drafting a plan that would force traders to trade either for themselves or customers, but not both, on a given day. Dual trading, under which a trader buys or sells futures contracts for himself and for customers, has come under attack as a potential conflict of interest. One complaint against the practice is that it creates a situation which allows a trader, who has a customer order for a large transaction, to first trade his own account in a way that would profit from price swings resulting from filing the customer's order. This practice would violate the current law. The Board of Trade and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> both permit dual trading. However some traders who fill orders for brokerage houses are prohibited by the firms from trading their own accounts. Brokers and traders at both the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> have been under investigation for two years by federal agents who suspect customers may have been defrauded of millions of dollars. In addition to restrictions on dual trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> officials also are expected to propose a deadline for bringing large orders to the trading pits, the <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said. As it is now, large orders sometimes show up just seconds before closing, creating frantic buying and selling, as well as completion of deals after the closing bell has sounded. The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce these and other proposed reforms next week. Meanwhile at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowrance </PERSON> resigned from the exchange's 24-member board of governors. The exchange said Thursday that the resignation was for personal reasons. The resignation was not related to the continuing federal investigation of suspected trading fraud, said <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission more quickly if the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would share findings from its trading-fraud investigation in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We're not asking to be part of the criminal investigation,'' said Rep. E `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, D-Texas. `` All we want is information that will help us do our job.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s authority to regulate the nation's commodity markets expires this year, and lawmakers expected fast action on legislation to reauthorize the commission through 1994, de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said Thursday. Their plans were altered by disclosure of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s undercover investigation of the futures markets. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said he contacted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> once the probe was disclosed several weeks ago seeking information that would help in the committee's review of the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> reauthorization. `` We have n't seen a thing,'' he said. `` Zilch at this time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment.

 Co-workers probably tumbled in laughter when someone not too long ago adjusted his tie, stood up in the boardroom and said with a straight face, `` I predict people will actually pay real money to watch fake wrestling on television.'' But the idea was so crazy it was brilliant. In today's expanding universe of pay-per-view television, no programming concoction is too outrageous for those addicted viewers cruising for a new video fix. With pay-per-view, cable television subscribers can wolf down a buffet of television `` events'' _ including movies, concerts, boxing and more than enough wrestling _ without winching themselves off the sofa. Seats are front-row and, best of all, there are usually no stupid commercials. Car-race fanatics with $ 13 to spare can see the Miller High Life 500 on June 17 with no breaks in the action. Stir-crazy businessmen, taking shelter in some Holiday Inn, can fork over $ 7 for a private television broadcast of a soft-core porno movie. Thousands of viewers are expected to shell out 15 bucks in April to watch <PERSON> Evel </PERSON> <PERSON> Knievel </PERSON>'s son go motorcycle jumping. And in 1992, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> will offer up to 200 hours of selected Summer Olympic events on a pay-per-view basis, the network announced Dec. 22. With so many options, there's a heap of money coming through the door. Pay-per-view will become a billion-dollar industry within 10 years, up from less than $ 100 million in 1988, according to industry estimates. `` It's completely convenient,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, vice president of marketing and sales for Universal Pay TV. `` At eight o'clock, if you're bored, you can watch something. You do n't have to get up. You do n't have to go to the video store or anywhere else.'' In theory, the pay-per-view process is simple enough: you order `` Good Morning, <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'' at 7 p.m., it arrives de-scrambled on your television set an hour later, and the movie's charged on your next bill. In practice, however, it can be a more frustrating experience. While most of today's pay-per-view transactions -LRB- from $ 5 to $ 40 -RRB- are conducted over the phone, future technologies may streamline the process to a single remote control. Optical-fiber `` video-on-demand'' cable systems, now being tested in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will supply hundreds more titles at any time in the day. For pay-per-view companies, the easier the transaction, the brighter the future. Parents, beware. Pay-per-view caters to the same impulsive buyers who grab cheap pens and eyeglass nose cushions at supermarket checkouts _ never realizing they could probably do without until it's too late. With pay-per-view, though, there's the added chance that, just once, the purchase could be electrifying. About 600,000 fans optimistically coughed up $ 35 per home to watch last June's `` fight'' between <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinks </PERSON>, which ended abruptly after 91 seconds. The Nov. 7 title match between Sugar <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalonde </PERSON> brought in close to $ 20 million in pay-per-view grosses, just behind the Tyson-Spinks receipts. `` I think people love the excitement of a big championship fight,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, chairman of pay-per-view giant <ORGANIZATION> Request </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. `` You can have a group of people over to the house for the price of one ticket ... and have a beer and popcorn party.'' <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> ratings that would make network programmers scribble out suicide notes can be solid gold on pay-per-view, due to higher profit margins. `` We can make money on one rating point,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurnit </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Showtime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Event </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. Although pay-per-view has been workable throughout the 1980s, only 21 percent of the country's 45 million cable households now have equipment permitting phone orders. That figure may double by 1990, and 40 million homes may have access to pay-per-view by 1994, according to estimates by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Associates </PERSON>, a media research firm. Yet the long-touted promise of pay-per-view has been slow in arriving, stalled by poor marketing, film-studio fears and technological obstacles. Cable television's reputation for poor customer service has n't encouraged subscribers to experiment with a more complicated product `` There's still a long way to go in consumer marketing,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Clott </PERSON>, executive vice president of the video division at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>. `` And we want to find a technology that prohibits home taping.'' The studios do n't want pay-per-view broadcasts to undermine the $ 2 billion home video market. Worried that pay-per-view customers will videotape their purchases, the studios typically offer movies to pay-per-view systems more than a month after their home-video debut, thereby dulling the excitement. Meanwhile, pay-per-view program options continue expanding. <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Knievel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Evel </PERSON>'s son, will try to hurdle the <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>'s Palace fountains on April 14 <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> wo n't have it, but you can see the leap -LRB- or crash -RRB- on <ORGANIZATION> Showtime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Event </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. On Feb. 10, <ORGANIZATION> Request </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> will carry a taped concert of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Liza </PERSON> <PERSON> Minnelli </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, at $ 14.95. Leaders in the pay-per-view business are predicting that Broadway openings, more pop music concerts, art auctions, business seminars and possibly the Super Bowl and the World Series soon could become pay-per-view staples. So, in the end, pay-per-view's future may lie in giving customers those unusual attractions they ca n't find at theaters, in video stores, or on any other broadcast or cable television channel. Said Showtime's <PERSON> Kurnit </PERSON>: `` We've always looked at the event business as where we'll make our money.'' What the word `` event'' comes to mean, though, is anybody's guess.

 Four top executives at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have resigned in what one described as a `` difference of opinion regarding the firm's future,'' according to published reports today The resignations came less than two weeks after <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> put the head of its own investment banking unit in charge of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION>'s profitable division. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, head of investment banking and the highest-ranking <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> veteran, was among those who submitted his resignation Thursday, according to today's editions of the Wall Street Journal and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> and other sources told the newspapers that other <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> executives besides the four also were considering resigning and that the firm was paralyzed over concerns about the firm's future, the newspapers said. However, <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cathcart </PERSON> was quoted as saying the situation was not so serious. `` We're going to miss a few people, but life will go on,'' the Journal quoted <PERSON> Cathcart </PERSON> as saying. He also added that GE and <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> are developing a new business strategy and that `` it's a good plan and everybody agrees with it.'' Others who resigned were <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, co-head of mergers and acquisitions; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrander </PERSON>, a managing director who worked on new business development; and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, managing director of mortgage trading. Analysts have said that the recent senior management changes by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> reflected the parent company's desire to exert greater control over <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION>'s day-to-day operations, as well as <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s latest attempt to deal with difficulties posed by the firm. Since GE purchased 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, the Wall Street firm has lost clients and employees. Some <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> executives have complained about <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s investment banking strategy and about changes that apparently reduced employee bonuses. Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> installed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, an executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, part of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, as president and chief executive officer of the securities firm. That led to the resignation of <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the brokerage unit. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a 20-year veteran of the brokerage, had been running the group's daily operations. Following <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>'s resignation Thursday, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> issued a statement saying, `` While we regret his decision, he leaves behind a strong organization that will continue to function as an important part of this firm. `` It is our intention to find a most appropriate leader for investment banking for the 1990s.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today that any plan to rescue the troubled savings and loan industry `` will not be popular'' but he pledged that the government will continue to guarantee the safety of insured deposits. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met at the White House with Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to seek their ideas on how to resolve the crisis of failing savings and loans. A bailout may cost the public upwards of $ 100 billion. `` We've got a big problem in the savings and loan'' industry, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the lawmakers, meeting in the Cabinet Room. `` There are no easy answers, no worrying about blame _ plenty to go around. I want to see the problem solved.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, pledged their cooperation in seeking a solution. After the meeting, Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, senior <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said an idea floated by the administration last week for a fee on savings deposits `` is not a live option'' even though the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has not disavowed it publicly. However, <PERSON> Garn </PERSON> said he believes savings institutions will have to pay a higher premium to obtain federal insurance for deposits. Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not give a clue about what he would propose `` I would n't say he gave an indication where his thinking is going. He did take a lot of notes'' on the points raised by participants. `` We're going to look to find a way to put together a funding package that is as fair as it can be,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said. `` We're going to look to the taxpayers absolutely as a last resort.'' Setting out a timetable for producing an administration plan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he will meet Saturday with <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to hear their final recommendations and then early next week reveal the course he will take. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the congressional leaders, `` you're not being presented here with a stacked deck. We need ideas and if we're overlooking something, we want to know what it is. The president said, `` Whatever we come up with will not be popular. And I expect then whatever you come up with will not be popular. But we've got to get on and get the problem solved.'' `` We want to work with you. This is a serious problem,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The administration is worried that advertisements from banks in three states questioning the safety of savings and loan accounts may needlessly scare depositors who are already worried. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who was present at today's meeting, criticized the ads Thursday at a private, hour-long meeting of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and five S & amp; L and bank trade associations, said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, who attended the meeting. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, waving copies of several of the ads, said, `` Gentlemen, it is absolutely, unequivocally irresponsible to have placed those ads,'' according to another participant, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At today's meeting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not mention the ads but said, `` The safety of those deposits is guaranteed, will continue to be guaranteed and there should be no feeling around the country that some solution will do anything to diminish the credit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> being behind the deposits, the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, whatever it is.'' The Federal Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> insures deposits at S & amp; Ls and the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> insures those at commercial banks. <PERSON> Mary-Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> gave the association copies of advertisements placed by banks in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` We are going to call the banks and inform them of the concern in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the sensitivity that they might not be aware of,'' she said. `` We made a promise to the administration that we would certainly monitor it and we agreed with their concern.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not speak at the meeting about the ads or reveal any preference among the many options for addressing the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis, according to participants. `` He was there to learn from us and he's a good listener,'' <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> said. `` It was very gratifying. The man is personally involved in this.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said proposals in the president's address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday `` will be pretty specific. You'll know exactly what our proposal is.'' The spokesman outlined the `` basic points'' guiding the president: _ insured savings must be protected _ current problems must be solved and losses stopped _ permanent reforms preventing a recurrence must be enacted _ the deposit insurance system should be put on a sound financial footing _ cleanup costs must be equitably allocated <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s anger over the advertisements underscores the administration's concern that the debate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> over how to pay for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L crisis has unnerved some thrift depositors. Last week, regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> reported higher-than-expected S & amp; L withdrawals after <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and other administration officials discussed a suggestion that depositors pay a fee to raise money for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout. Meeting participants said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stressed, as he did a week ago in a nationally televised news conference, that the deposits are backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. He planned to make the same point in his speech next week. But <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, added: `` The feeling in the meeting was this is a serious situation. By the time it gets to be a real run, it's too late.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, urged the government to take prompt control of the 350 remaining insolvent, but still open, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls after agreement is reached later this year on a bailout and reform package. The congressional auditing and investigative agency said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should provide a plan to raise $ 85 billion over three years, coupled with a reform package. At that point _ which some senators say may be as late as the fall _ regulators should take control of institutions, placing them into receivership as necessary. In testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bowsher </PERSON> criticized regulators' current approach of using promissory notes and loss guarantees to conserve cash and spread rescue costs over 10 years. In another development, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> released a long-awaited report from the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> that turned up six instances in which independent accounting firms `` did not adequately audit'' institutions that later failed. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said `` auditing and reporting problems -LRB- were -RRB- significant enough -LRB- in six cases -RRB- to warrant our referring the CPA firms performing the audits to regulatory and professional bodies for their review.''

<TEXT>
 Unemployment rose slightly in January to 5.4 percent, but the number of jobs created last month shot up to 408,000, the government said today in a report that indicated strong economic growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the civilian unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage point from the December rate of 5.3 percent. But the first major report of the economy's 1989 performance showed continued strong growth, something analysts have predicted would feed inflationary fears and perhaps convince the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on credit. In another report signaling vibrant economic growth, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods surged 4.1 percent in December, the biggest rise in six months. Bond prices were modestly lower after the reports, indicating investors' concerns about inflation caused by overheating. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond, which rises when the price falls, climbed to 8.84 percent from 8.80 percent late Thursday. The dollar rose on speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would push up short-term rates to hold down inflation, making short-term dollar-denominated securities more attractive to global investors. Not willing to let the dollar climb too high, central banks of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> all reportedly intervened in the market to sell dollars. At midmorning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the central banks' sales managed to hold the dollar below the psychologically important level of 1.89 West German marks. The dollar rose, nevertheless, against the mark and the British pound, while declining slightly against the Japanese yen. Stock prices were mixed. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.93 to 2,342.68 in the first hour of trading. The 408,000 new nonfarm jobs created last month followed a gain of 279,000 in December and nearly matched November's robust gain of 440,000 new jobs. Analysts had predicted that January job growth would be in the 250,000 range and that any growth of more than 300,000 could trouble the markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the unemployment rate rose because the number of people in the labor force grew even faster than the number of people with jobs. The labor force expanded by nearly 900,000 people, with about 700,000 of them finding jobs. A record 62.9 percent of the working-age population had jobs. On Thursday, reports indicated that higher interest rates are hurting the housing market but have n't dissuaded consumers from a generous spending spree at the nation's big department stores. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday new home sales rose a meager 0.9 percent last year to 677,000 dwellings, vs. 671,000 sold in 1987. Housing industry analysts said they expected continued increases in interest rates and a slowdown in the economy to result in decreased new home sales this year. `` The bottom's not falling out of the market by any means but we do expect a modest slowing,'' said economist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Fixed-rate mortgages last week stood at 10.6 percent, up from 10.16 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Many economists are predicting interest rates could hit 11.5 percent by the middle of this year. Tighter credit evidently is n't hurting the nation's biggest retailers, however. Most said Thursday in reporting January sales that they benefited from light inventories and an unusually warm winter. The low inventory levels, due to unexpectedly brisk Christmas business and tight control of stocks, saved general merchandise and apparel retailers from having to slash prices to move out the excess goods. Patterns of retail purchases are closely watched for indications of overall consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the country's overall economic activity. In other economic news Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said he would prefer a gasoline tax increase to an oil import fee in the event <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can not meet its deficit-reduction targets through spending cuts alone. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he would most prefer that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut spending to meet the fiscal 1990 deficit target of $ 100 billion. None of the Thursday developments had much effect on the financial markets. Stocks meandered and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 4.46 to 2,333.75; bond prices barely budged; and the dollar ended mixed in slow trading.

 Unemployment rose slightly in January to 5.4 percent, but an unexpectedly high 408,000 jobs were created at the same time, the government said today in the first major economic report for the new year. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the civilian unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage point from the December rate of 5.3 percent. But the report showed continued strong growth, something analysts have predicted would feed inflationary fears and perhaps convince the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to tighten its reins on credit. The 408,000 new nonfarm jobs created last month followed a revised gain of 221,000 in December and nearly matched November's robust gain of 440,000 new jobs Anaysts had predicted that January job growth would be in the 250,000 range and that any growth of more than 300,000 could trouble the markets. `` It's a much stronger report than we thought,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` It suggests we are going into the first quarter -LRB- of 1989 -RRB- a lot stronger than we thought, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is going to tighten -LRB- credit -RRB- and short-term interest rates will be going up.'' In another report today signifying strength in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders to factories for manufactured goods surged 4.1 percent in December, the biggest rise in six months and a sharp upturn from the increases of 0.5 percent in November and 2.0 percent in October. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the labor force expanded by nearly 900,000 people, with about 700,000 of them finding jobs, and that a record 62.9 percent of the working-age population had jobs. The unseasonably warm weather in much of the country helped contruction employment rise by 102,000 jobs last month, the department said. Manufacturing employment also was up for the fourth month in a row, with 45,000 new January jobs split virtually evenly between the durable and non-durable goods industries. There were 260,000 new jobs in the service-producing sector of the economy, with the 135,000 in retail trades accounting for more than half of that figure. Service industries reported adding 75,000 new jobs last month, down from an average monthly gain of 110,000 in that sector throughout 1988. In data closely watched for signs of inflation, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that average hourly earnings of nonsupervisory employees climbed by 0.6 percent, or 9 cents, while average weekly earnings rose 1.2 percent in January. Those figures are adjusted to reflect traditional seasonal changes in the employment picture. In another sign of continued economic strength, the manufacturing work week rose by 0.1 hour to 41.0 hours and average factory overtime held steady at 3.9 hours. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, commissioner of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, said it was difficult to interpret the January data because of the seasonal pressures on the economy usually triggered by colder weather and the passing of the Christmas season. `` Supported by January's mild weather and an economy that continues to grow, many of the usual seasonal job reductions did not take place this year,'' Ms. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said in testimony prepared for the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Because of the 865,000 gain in the number of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> seeking jobs last month, the unemployment rate edged up slightly despite the job growth. Of the 123.4 million people in the labor force last month, 116.7 million had jobs and 6.7 million were seeking employment, the government said. A separate government unemployment rate that includes the nearly 1.7 million members of the armed services stationed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also was 5.4 percent in January, like the civilian rate up 0.1 percentage point from December. In the civilian economy, the jobless rate among whites remained unchanged in January at 4.6 percent; the rate was 4 percent for white men and 3.9 percent for white women. The civilian unemployment rate among blacks climbed to 12 percent in January from 11.6 percent in December, while the jobless rate among black teen-agers jumped to 34.5 percent from 29.6 percent. There also was an increase in unemployment among Hispanics, from 7.6 percent in December to 8.4 percent last month. The robust report on the job market comes on the heels of several other reports this week suggesting continued economic growth _ at rates some economists believer are too high to ward off inflation. Today's unemployment report was the first of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency and came just four days before the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s open market committee meets to set monetary targets for the new year. Earlier this week, the government reported its index of leading indicators, its main economic forecasting gauge, climbed 0.6 percent in December. Also out this week were reports that construction spending rebounded and jumped 2.2 percent in December and that personal income rose 0.9 percent in the final month of 1988. Last week, the government reported a 2 percent gain in the gross national product for the fourth quarter of 1988 and a 6.4 percent December jump in durable goods orders. `` Their statistics on the economy continue to flash green,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` There is no stopping this economy.''

The winter wheat crop appeared to be most vulnerable in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where temperatures have plunged after rising in the past week to levels high enough to cause some seed germination. `` The biggest threat is heaving of the ground where you have alternate hot and cold,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We've certainly had the warm part of it and now it looks like we'll have the cold,'' he said. Export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grains and soybeans have slowed to a crawl, and there was little news to influence corn and soybean prices. In early trading, wheat was \ cent lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.27 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.71 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 \ cents lower with March at $ 2.16 a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents lower to 2 cents higher with March at $ 7.62 -LCB- a Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .05 cent to .13 cent higher with February at 75.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent lower to .03 cent higher with March at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .50 cent higher with February at 43.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent to .25 cent higher with February at 39.80 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Thursday.

<HEAD>Bush Tax Proposal Piques Wall Street's Interest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investors in the securities markets will have a special interest in the budget proposal President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> makes to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week. Of course, anyone with a stake in stocks and bonds will be eager to see what the new administration and the legislators can do to deal with the government's deficit problems. But beyond that, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s message, scheduled to be delivered Thursday, is expected to contain a proposal dear to the hearts of many Wall Streeters _ restoring a tax break for long-term capital gains. Before passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the maximum tax rate on capital gains from the sale of stocks, bonds and other assets held for more than six months was 20 percent, while other types of income fell into tax brackets as high as 50 percent. Tax reform lumped all income, including capital gains, into a single category with a maximum tax rate that now stands at 33 percent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he would like to cut the top rate on long-term gains to 15 percent. Such a change would seem to go against the spirit of the nation's new tax system In addition, preferential treatment of capital gains has long been opposed by some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and others who say its benefits go disproportionately to the wealthy. Yet many observers believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s idea will get serious consideration. `` I think there's a very good chance'' it or something like it will be enacted, said <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, a tax expert at the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Andersen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The present tax system provides no incentive for long-term investment, Head observed, and `` that's not what we should do.'' The tax law now defines `` long term'' as more than one year between the date of purchase and sale. A single maximum rate could be established for assets held that long. Alternatively, capital gains rates could be set on a sliding scale, declining as the holding period for an investment increases. Proponents of a break for long-term gains say it would help maintain a stable base of capital for business and perhaps discourage the kind of short-term, roll-of-the-dice trading that contributes to market volatility. Of course, given the problem of the budget deficit, this is not a likely time for politicians to be handing out new tax breaks. Before any change is made in the tax system these days, a persuasive case must be made that the new setup will add to tax receipts or at minimum be `` revenue neutral.'' In the current discussion, Head acknowledges, `` people will allege that the wealthy are getting something, so they ought to give something back.'' Advocates of lower capital gains rates insist, however, that they actually increase revenues to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> by encouraging more people to pursue and realize long-term gains. It is even possible, analysts say, that the talk generated by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal has contributed to the improved mood of the stock market in recent weeks. The prospect of a change in the rules has begun to carry some weight in the investment decisions people make. For anyone planning to sell an investment or other property in the next year or two, the debate certainly bears watching.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could give the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> its reauthorization more quickly if the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would share its findings from a trading-fraud investigation in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> says. `` We're not asking to be part of the criminal investigation,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Eligio </PERSON> `` Kika'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, D-Texas. `` All we want is information that will help us do our job.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s authority to regulate the nation's commodity markets expires this year, and lawmakers expected fast action on legislation to reauthorize the commission through 1994, de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said Thursday. But their plans were altered by disclosure of a two-year, undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of alleged widespread fraud and illegal trading practices in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures markets. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said he contacted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> once the probe was disclosed several weeks ago seeking information that would help in the committee's review of the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> reauthorization. `` We have n't seen a thing,'' he said. `` Zilch at this time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged receipt of the request from de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> in a Jan. 19 letter and said it had contacted his office today. However, a spokesman said the bureau could not reveal the nature of the response and also refused to discuss the investigation of allegations that brokers and traders cheated customers out of millions of dollars in deals on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> assigned an agriculture subcommittee headed by Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> English, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., to conduct its own investigation of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> trading scandal to see if the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s regulatory authority needs to be strengthened Congressional critics have challenged the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>'s effectiveness as a regulator and contend it should become part of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investigation places an added burden on proponents of an independent futures commission. `` It puts us in a defensive position, and that's not the position we'd like to be in,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> said. `` But I think the issue that is more important, rather than whether or not we have to defend our image, is what this is doing to market confidence ...'' `` We do have some very serious concerns _ and have reason for them based on responses we're getting from people in the industry _ about public perceptions of the markets and confidence in those markets.'' The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> was established in 1974 to enforce federal laws relating to commodities futures and options, including gold and silver. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> agriculture committees have jurisdiction over the commission because futures and options trading originally involved only agricultural commodities. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> account for thousands of dollars given annually to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, either in honoraria for visits or in campaign contributions through political action committees. However, English said financial contributions would not affect lawmakers' handling of the exchanges' regulators. Lawmakers agreed the congressional investigation was unlikely to result in elimination of the commission and said the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> probably would be reauthorized even with the delay. `` If the investigation does not give us information that we need for our reauthorization by the end of May, then we may have to proceed,'' de la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> said. `` Then, if information is given that means we need to change law, we can do that. But it would be better for all concerned if we did it all at one time.'' Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Thursday to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to implement its planned <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> electronic trading system, which would permit worldwide computerized trading during hours when the exchange floors are closed. The commission authorized the exchange to begin using the system this fall. Initially, trading would be limited to gold futures contracts, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills and various currencies, but all existing and subsequent <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> futures and options contracts eventually would be eligible for trading through <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> said. Supporters of the system say that in addition to making the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exchange more competitive in world markets, electronic trading could enhance the ability to police and detect trading abuses.

<HEAD>Textile Company Puts Itself Up For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s directors put the company up for sale today, saying a sweetened bid of $ 1.54 billion from <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was unacceptable but they would entertain higher bids from others. `` It is the intention of the board to effect a sale of the company, assuming that an acceptable proposal is received,'' said a statement from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, Ga.-based textile giant. It said the board has authorized its advisers to notify parties that have expressed an interest in a possible buyout that it would consider their bids. The announcement marked a significant shift in the <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> board's position on the matter of a takeover. In a filing last week with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the company said it was not for sale but indicated it was talking with third parties that might be interested in a purchase. Chicago-based Farley, which originally offered $ 48 per share for <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding stock last October, increased its bid to $ 52, or a total of $ 1.54 billion, on Wednesday. The <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> board today considered <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s new offer and decided `` that values in excess of $ 52 per share could be realized in a sale of the company,'' the statement said. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON> was out of his office today and could not be reached for comment on <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s announcement. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chairman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed it last week and it now goes to Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON> upheld the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Business Combination Statute, which was passed last year at the urging of the state's textile industry. Under the statute, a company can not buy another firm and then merge with it for five years unless it acquires 90 percent of the outstanding stock of the target firm. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> had challenged the statute as part of its hostile attempt to take over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> in a statement Thursday said he remained undeterred by the ruling. A statement from <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> said the company was `` pleased'' with <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>'s ruling, but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>, in his ruling, said <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> failed to show that the statute prevents hostile bidders `` from enjoying a meaningful opportunity'' to complete buyouts of Georgia-based companies. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> declined to say whether it would appeal <PERSON> Tidwell </PERSON>'s ruling, but indicated that it is counting on a special meeting of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>'s shareholders Feb. 25 to win the three-month takeover fight. At that meeting <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> will seek to replace <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>'s board members with its own directors, who would remove the poison pill and coverage of the state statute.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Dips In '88, But Progress Petering
Out</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s massive current account surplus shrank in 1988 for the first time in seven years, but progress toward reducing it petered out at the end of the year, a government report showed Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s report showed that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> continues to export far more than it imports and no end to the imbalance is in sight. The current account surplus fell 8.7 percent to $ 79.5 billion from $ 87 billion in 1987, the ministry said. In December, the surplus shrank to $ 9.27 billion from $ 9.44 billion a year earlier. But the December surplus was sharply higher than November 1988's $ 6.76 billion, the ministry said The current account is the broadest measure of a nation's international financial flows, and includes trade, investment income, tourism and other transactions <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus also declined 1.7 percent during the year to $ 94.8 billion from $ 96.4 billion the previous year. It was the first annual drop in the trade surplus in six years, ministry officials said. But December's trade surplus continued a recent upward trend, rising to a record $ 10.9 billion from $ 9.96 billion a year earlier and $ 7.56 billion in November 1988. The ministry announcement did not include breakdowns of trade figures by country or region. The decline in the current account surplus was due primarily to the growing number of Japanese traveling overseas and increasing payments of patent royalties, ministry officials said. A record 8.40 million Japanese travelers spent a record $ 15.8 billion abroad in 1988, compared to the previous year's $ 8.66 billion, they said. The year-to-year drop in the current account surplus during December came as a relief to the government, which had expressed concern when the gap grew for two months in a row in October and November. The recent increases in the surplus raised the prospect that the government's attempt to restore balance to its external accounts may have begun faltering after months of steady declines resulting partly from the appreciation of the Japanese yen. The drop in the current account surplus in 1988 does not necessarily give reason for optimism, according to <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` We ca n't say whether the downtrend is going to continue,'' one ministry official said. `` It depends on a lot of things, like oil prices.'' A rise in oil prices would increase <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s import bills and result in a reduction in the current account surplus. Exports and imports last year, as measured when contracts were settled, were at record highs, with exports reaching $ 259.6 billion, surpassing the previous record of $ 224.6 billion in 1987. Imports came to $ 164.8 billion, far more than the prior record of $ 129.6 billion in 1981. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> includes freight and insurance costs in its import figures, but not in its exports. That method makes imports look bigger and thus makes the trade surplus appear smaller. The 1988 statistics showed that vigorous domestic demand in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has pushed up imports, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Oil prices drifted down most of the year, but strong domestic demand for manufactured goods led to an increase in imports and helped reduce external surpluses, they said. December was the third consecutive month in which <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus showed an increase. In addition, the surplus was a record high, exceeding the previous record of $ 10.2 billion set in December 1986. Confounding predictions, the record monthly surplus came at a time when the yen was at one of its highest points against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, making Japanese products more expensive overseas. Since then, the dollar has rebounded against the yen, possibly leading to further increases in Japanese exports in coming months. The decrease in the current account surplus in 1988 was the first since the account began showing a surplus in 1981, ministry officials said.

<HEAD>Economists: New Tax Laws To Boost Japan's Luxury Imports, Consumption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New tax laws to take effect here April 1 are likely to boost sales of automobiles, liquor, jewelry and high-tech electronics _ good news for companies exporting to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Economists say although the mainstay of the tax reform, a 3 percent sales tax, will raise many prices in this most expensive of nations, the overall impact of the reform on the Japanese economy will be positive. The new laws, the first major overhaul of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s tax system since 1949, will reduce income, residential, corporate and inheritance taxes by $ 45 billion in fiscal 1989, which begins April 1. In line with government policy, the reform will encourage consumption of luxury products through the elimination of a variety of special taxes on cars, liquor, jewelry, golf equipment and electronics. This step is expected to inject an additional $ 26 billion into <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s robust economy in fiscal 1989. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also is trying to get its people to work shorter hours. Banks that used to be open on alternate Saturdays will now be closed all Saturdays, starting with this one, under a plan to move key institutions to a five-day work week. Reflecting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economic strength, the government said Friday that the jobless rate fell to a 6 -LCB- - year low of 2.3 percent in December, while the surplus in the broadest measure of foreign trade rose again because of booming exports <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 40-year-old tax structure no longer suited the needs of an affluent, aging society, <PERSON> Shigeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday. The system, drafted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation authorities while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was rebuilding after its defeat in World War II, slapped high taxes on purchases of liquor, tobacco, furs, jewelry, large appliances and other items considered to be luxury goods. `` Now, it's hard to decide what goods are luxury items,'' <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON> said. Retailers will see sales increase when commodity taxes as high as 23 percent are replaced by the 3 percent sales tax, says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koo </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` Its a positive step in encouraging consumption. ... It should make a big difference,'' <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> said. The reform also is intended to help cut <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus and respond to foreign criticism of taxes on high-quality liquor and other goods that boost import prices, <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> estimates the new tax laws alone, by slashing prices on luxury imports, will cut <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s current account surplus by $ 2 billion in 1991. Overall, the tax reform is expected to boost <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s output of goods and services by about 0.2 percent. Although consumer prices are forecast to rise 1.2 percent as a result of a new sales tax, taxes overall will decline by $ 20 billion, the government estimates. However, some predict the government will quickly raise the sales tax rate from the initial 3 percent, resulting in an increase in total taxes. The main goal of the reform, the government maintains, is to distribute the tax burden more equitably. The tax cuts favor middle-aged salary earners through special deductions for dependents aged 16 to 22. `` The middle-aged salary workers felt their tax burdens were heavy and unfair, given the high educational expenses for their children,'' <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON> said. Critics say the new sales tax is a virtual sieve of loopholes that favors the rich while squeezing lower-income earners. <PERSON> Ohara </PERSON> responded that while higher - and middle-income earners will benefit most, all taxpayers will benefit from the cuts The new sales tax exempts small businesses, a feature that gained the tax's acceptance among the shopkeepers associations which had helped defeat earlier attempts at tax reform.

<HEAD>Inflation Inevitable? Maybe Not</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Resending to fix cycle designator.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When you're looking for signs of inflation, as everyone seems to be these days, you'll find them. There are always little pimples that have the potential to become open sores. The jobless figures are one of them. Unemployment is now down to 5.2 percent of the labor force, a level that many economists feel is scraping the bottom of the barrel. It is, after all, less than half the unemployment rate at which the current expansion began. When you scrape bottom you tend to get inferior workers. They have fewer skills, and probably none at all. They require expensive training, and even then tend to perform poorly. They are costly. Such a situation puts pressure on profits and, according to inflation theorists, causes employers to raise prices. Thus, an inflationary spiral is begun. But is there an alternative to that thesis? That's just one of the questions being asked by a small number of economists who are questioning a lot of the conventional thinking of late. One of those challenges to convention is that a labor shortgage, rather than forcing up prices, will finally force some industries to do without additional labor and, instead, institute more efficient procedures. Some of those industries, it is argued, have had it too good. In some of the retail service industries, for example, employers have been able to tap a huge supply of unskilled workers and homemakers seeking part-time jobs. Tremendous numbers of workers have been hired by fast-food outlets, for example, because there was an available supply of teenagers and adult women seeking part-time jobs. It was easier to hire than to improve efficiency. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> economist, observes that from 1968 to 1988, when payroll employment rose by 38 million, service-producing jobs accounted for an astounding 95 percent of the total gain. These employers are now facing a critical situation. Do they seek to hire more workers from a smaller labor supply and pay them ever-higher wages? Or will they be forced to reconsider the situation and take another course? Giving urgency to that consideration is another factor: Many service companies are facing a profits squeeze because of consumer resistance to higher prices. If puts them in the position of being unable to tolerate higher costs. Looking for a solution to the problem, many companies might be forced to reconsider their labor policies. They might seek, instead, to obtain higher productivity through better systems for producing and delivering products. There is nothing new in this, and it might have been forced on service companies long ago were it not for the availability of low-cost labor. But now that pool may be drying up; and no matter, it is getting more costly. If this occurs, says <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> and like-thinkers, then low jobless rates in effect will boost national productivity, which should reduce inflationary pressures. `` During the 1970s, we experienced high unemployment and high inflation. In the 1990s, we should experience low unemployment and low inflation,'' he says. It is something to think about when you hear the inflation alarmists shouting their equivalent of `` fire.'' They have been at it for several years now, and one day they might be right. But, as <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON> and others remind us, inflation is not an inevitable and automatic response to any uncomfortable news. Sometimes we put the proper salve on the pimple. Sometimes inflation does n't happen.

 Stock prices marked time today, faced with news of stronger-than-expected employment growth at the start of 1989. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.57 to 2,330.18 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers and losers ran about even in nationwide trading of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 672 up, 671 down and 543 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that payroll employment grew by 408,000 jobs in January, well above advance estimates on Wall Street.

 Factory orders shot up 4.1 percent in December as American manufacturers, bolstered by a boom in export sales, last year posted their best showing since 1979, the government said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable and non-durable manufactured goods reached a seasonally adjusted total of $ 237.6 billion in December after making more modest gains of 0.5 percent in November and 2.0 percent in October. While many analysts are expecting economic growth to slow during the coming year, 1988 closed on a strong note, with many year-end reports showing vigorous activity in December. December's rise, much of it pinned on increased orders for cars, ships and planes, was the biggest monthly gain since a 5.4 increase in June. Orders for manufactured goods were up a strong 9.7 percent to $ 2.66 trillion for all of 1988, the best showing since a 12.1 percent increase in 1979. `` The overall picture is of an economy that is quite bouyant, robust, humming along,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chief economist <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>. Factory orders also had been up sharply in 1987, rising 7.1 percent after falling 1.2 percent in 1986 and 0.6 percent in 1985. American manufacturers rebounded in the last two years as the decline of dollar against foreign currencies made <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products more competitive overseas. In the previous two years, manufacturers had lost both domestic and overseas sales to foreign manufacturers. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said that while the latest factory orders report was positive, `` we are not producing goods at a rapid enough rate to make progress on the trade deficit. `` As good as it is,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said of the report, `` it's not good enough.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit ballooned to a five-month high in November, reflecting a surge in imports and a slight drop in exports. The volatile category of defense orders surged 19 percent in December to $ 10 billion after plunging 21.5 percent during the previous month. Even excluding the militarysector, however, manufacturers' orders in December still were up a healthy 3.6 percent after a 1.6 percent gain in November. Transportation orders, another area subject to wide swings, jumped 19.7 percent to $ 38.8 billion after falling 7.2 percent in November. The motor vehicle, aircraft and shipbuilding industries all showed large gains. Excluding transportation, orders were up 1.6 percent in December after a 1.8 percent rise in November. `` Even taking out some of the increases in airlines and automobiles and transportation, total orders look to be taking off toward the end of the year,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a barometer of industry investment plans, rose 8.2 percent to $ 38.7 billion in December. `` Big ticket'' durable goods _ items expected to last three years or longer _ posted a robust 6.4 percent increase in December to a seasonally adjusted $ 131 billion, largely on the strength of the transportation orders. Non-durable goods, meanwhile, were up 1.4 percent to $ 106.6 billion, with the largest gains occurring in rubber and plastics, paper and apparel. Shipments of manufactured goods were up 2.4 percent in December to a seasonally adjusted $ 230.1 billion. Shipments for the year totaled $ 2.61 trillion, up 9.2 percent from 1987.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Directors of <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> put the textile giant on the auction block Friday while urging stockholders to reject a sweetened $ 1.54 billion bid from <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, which offered $ 48 a share when it started its hostile takeover bid in October, raised the offer to $ 52 Wednesday But the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION> board decided they think stockholders can do better. `` It is the intention of the board to effect a sale of the company, assuming that an acceptable proposal is received,'' said a statement from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, Ga.-based company. It said the board has authorized its advisers, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, to tell interested parties that it would consider their bids. <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> has said it has no other bids in hand. Trading of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> stock was halted Friday morning, as is usual when a company has an announcement to make that could affect its stock price. When trading resumed, the stock rose $ 1.25 a share to $ 54.87 -LCB-. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, a textile analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said the formal decision to seek a buyer was a logical progression of events that started in October, when <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>'s board authorized management to look into a possible sale after <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s original bid. She said the statement urging shareholders not to accept the <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> offer does not mean <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> will not end up with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>. `` Once the price is right they really have to think of their shareholders,'' she said. Based on public information, a sale price of around $ 55 a share is reasonable, she said, adding that a spirited bidding war is at least a possibility. In a filing last week with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s officers had said the company was not for sale, but they indicated they were talking with third parties that might be interested in a purchase. The <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> board considered <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s new offer Friday and decided `` that values in excess of $ 52 per share could be realized in a sale of the company,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> statement said. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON>, a spokesman for Chicago-based <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, was out of his office Friday and could not be reached for comment on the announcement. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point-Pepperell </LOCATION>, founded in 1866, is the nation's largest publicly tradd textile company and makes such products as Martex sheets and towels and Gold Toe socks. It has 41,000 employees and 22,000 stockholders. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, one of the nation's largest privately held textile firms, controls Fruit of the <ORGANIZATION> Loom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Acme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

 Forecasters warn retailers to be cautious about 1989, but <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON> is planning expansion, renovation and an aggressive advertising strategy for the two <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> department stores she manages. `` We're not looking at doom and gloom in 1989,'' she said, basking in better-than-expected holiday sales. `` We're going to make sure we're in business to do business.'' That means big inventories, more advertising and swank additions, such as a Godiva chocolate counter to boost sales for Valentine's Day Hougard manages two <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> apparel stores, in downtown Grand Rapids and the suburb of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gafford </PERSON>, senior vice president of corporate affairs for the stores, part of the Cincinnati-based Federated retail chain, said higher levels of stockpiled merchandise in 1989 reflects company optimism. `` We're very, very bullish about'89,'' <PERSON> Gafford </PERSON> said. `` Not to a point of doing anything stupid, but we'll be very aggressive, increasing the breadth and width of our stock.'' <PERSON> Gafford </PERSON> said Christmas sales met the company's expectations, which he described as `` pretty optimistic.'' The only thing conservative about <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>' approach to 1989 is the traditional latticework decorations that will go up in the company's 43 stores in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON> dismisses the warnings of economic forecasters, who have predicted sluggish retail sales this year. `` You can hear just about anything listening to economic forecasters,'' <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON> said. `` You have to go forward and do business.'' <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>' approach to competing for limited dollars is simple: customer service. The idea is to combine the large selection and competitive prices of a department store with the personal attention a shopper might expect to find only at a small boutique. The anticipated result: a loyal customer. The Lazarus emphasis on customer service `` is something that's been highly prioritized in the last two or three years,'' <PERSON> Gafford </PERSON> said `` And we've already seen the returns on it. That's what the customer needs and wants.'' <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON>, as well as other department stores, is plugging its personal shopper program, whereby a customer can make an appointment and have a salesperson help build a wardrobe to fit the customer's tastes `` The customer can come in before we open and have the whole store to herself,'' <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON> said. `` The sales associate keeps a file on each shopper and can call if something the customer has been looking at goes on sale. ... With people being so busy, this is really catching on.'' While many stores conduct customer surveys, <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> likes management to talk to customers in person. Four times a year, a focus group composed of randomly chosen customers lunches with store officials to discuss suggested changes in merchandise and service. Hougard hopes the strong performance of her stores during the holiday season will put her in good standing when corporate executives review proposals from store managers for alterations at individual stores. `` Stores are out there fighting for available dollars; it's the same as -LRB- government -RRB- agencies fighting for grants,'' <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON> said. She is requesting that her apparel-only stores be expanded and turned into home stores with linens, gifts and house wares. An added plus is a new companywide advertising campaign, which will distribute a Sunday newspaper insert for the apparel-only stores as it does for its larger home stores. Most promotions, instead of beginning midweek and running through the weekend, will begin on Sunday and continue through the following weekend. `` It's what the customer wants, and that's what it's all about,'' <PERSON> Hougard </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Wheat, Soybeans Advance On Soviet Evacuation Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat and soybean futures closed moderately higher Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in late buying partially prompted by a report that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had ordered the evacuation of 20 villages contaminated by radiation from the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident. The wire-service report said residents of the unidentified Ukrainian farming communities had not previously been informed of the radiation leak and had been living and growing crops in highly contaminated soil. The Chernobyl incident sparked a sharp rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain futures in 1986 on fears of widespread contamination of Soviet crops. No new radiation leakage was reported on Friday `` but when you start hearing rumors of leakage of radiation, people start thinking ` Chernobyl' and ` Are we going to have another incident,''' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of floor operations for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn futures closed mixed while oats were slightly higher.

<BYLINE>Banker Says Public Ignored Bank's Ads On Deposit Safety</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By JAY JORDEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A banker who has run advertisements asking consumers if they were worried about the safety of savings and loan accounts says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration criticism of such ads may stir up depositors' worries rather than quell them. Industry officials in several states report little local concern about the ads, which the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> says have run in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` Locally, that ad stirred up nothing whatsoever and was not intended to stir up anything,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in Clay Center, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>. White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> criticized the ads as `` irresponsible,'' according to an industry official who met privately Thursday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and five thrift and bank trade associations On Jan. 24, <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, placed an ad in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Clay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> asking, `` Are you questioning how secure your money is with all the stories being published about the thrift industry?'' The ad also detailed the bank's stability and the security of deposits there. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that he wanted to reassure people who had questions about the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures bank deposits up to $ 100,000. `` When you're in a small, rural, conservative community, people are very conscious about the security of their money,'' he said. The Federal Savings and <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures thrift deposits to $ 100,000, is insolvent because of soaring outlays in recent years to compensate depositors in failed thrifts. Depositors apparently ignored the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> ad, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. No one in the north central <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> town of about 5,000 mentioned it to bank officials, and many of the bank's 22 employees did n't even know it ran, he said. `` I'm not so sure they -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials -RRB- have n't created more excitement about it just by bringing it up Locally it's a dead issue,'' he said. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Stones </PERSON>, research director for the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he had n't heard of any similar ads by the state's 589 other banks The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> said it could not disclose the names of banks that ran the ads. The banking industry in past years has run its own ad campaigns aimed at differentiating itself from the thrift industry in the eyes of consumers. `` It is a very sensitive issue for bankers who have been under siege for years now by some bankrupt savings and loans who are trying to compete with below-market rates,'' said <PERSON> Mary-Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` Credit unions are now claiming in their ads that they have the healthiest insurance fund,'' she said. `` So bankers are extremely sensitive and they are likely to continue to be in this case.'' She said the association was soon going `` to communicate the concerns expressed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to these institutions'' running the ads. `` The gist of one of the ads was, ` You sure have read a lot of information in the press about thrifts, and if you have any concerns, you should definitely keep your money in a bank,''' said Ms. <PERSON> Meany </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Katsanos </PERSON> said the agency has no policy on the ad tactics and was n't aware of them before Thursday. At least one <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> bank ran an ad recently contrasting the security of its deposits with those in thrifts, according to state industry officials. `` That was reported to me, but we have 255 banks in this state,'' said <PERSON> Bo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carvill </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It did happen but I do n't know anything more about it.'' One thrift official said he was not surprised by the ads. `` Perhaps those banks feel comfortable in making that distinction, but many of the banks have not been all that healthy,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sunbelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> marketing manager in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. `` Any funds institution has to be careful in today's environment in talking about another.''

 <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> quit his job as president of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, a year and a day after joining the carrier. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> said it had no plans to seek a successor to <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON>, who joined the airline as president following a long career with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON>'s departure comes two months after <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Corr </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> president and close associate of financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, became the new chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of giant <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The move enabled former <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to concentrate on his duties as chief of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. `` Speaking for the nearly 35,000 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, I want to express our sincere appreciation to <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> for his untiring efforts on behalf of the airline,'' <PERSON> Corr </PERSON> said in a statement. In another statement, <PERSON> Shugrue </PERSON> said: `` The marked improvements in performance and service at the airline are a tribute to all the members of the Continental family.

<TEXT>
 Being a savings and loan customer in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> means never being able to say, `` It's over.'' So far, the four <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls and one bank with which I've done business have gone through six bailouts, buyouts or failures. All of them have changed names, a few twice. One branch is now a frozen yogurt store _ with a drive-up window. The tally so far: I've lost money only once. Like most people in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> these days, my interest in the savings and loan crisis goes beyond a casual interest in reading about debates in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to a gut issue: What's it mean for me? In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the crisis is part of daily conversation. `` How do I make the check out now?'' I ask. `` Another one of those letters came today,'' my wife tells me. `` Maybe that's the end of it,'' I say, hopefully. Not so far. Letters telling us that our accounts had new owners and reassuring us that all was well became so frequent that we treated them like junk mail. Now I wish I had saved them to show my daughter. She'll never understand why people joke that when you buy a toaster these days, you get a S & amp; L for free. I even believe there's a strange sort of charm in driving up to a financial institution that has a giant plastic banner across the front, hiding any sign of its failed past. One day I pulled up to <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and saw a red sign telling customers the thrift would be closed for four days. `` That must be it,'' I thought; the end had come. Wrong. First <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was closing for the Veteran's Day holiday. Later, after it was announced that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perelman </PERSON> had bought the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> _ it had now changed names twice in a week _ I asked a teller how to make out the check. She had to ask someone. First <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, by the way, used to boast, `` We have ways to beat the'80s.'' Call me a cynic, but I think the'80s won. My wife and I opened a money market account at a somewhat notoriously high-flying S & amp; L, which was paying high rates but had already been taken over by the regulators. Maybe that's the end of trouble there, we thought. Not so. <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Savings </PERSON> was declared insolvent and sold under the Southwest Plan. And we got another letter. We financed a mortgage at an <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L that had already had action taken against it by regulators. That should be stable, we thought. Three days before Christmas, it was sold to an investor from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Now we joke about how to make out the mortgage check. My only loss came from a small investment in an <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> bond. <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION> was once the largest bank in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, but it was crushed by the oil and real estate collapse. RepublicBank, another <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> giant, bought <ORGANIZATION> InterFirst </ORGANIZATION>, and my bond became a FirstRepublic bond. That was n't so bad _ until FirstRepublic failed, too. It was bought by <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. That was n't so bad _ until <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> decided it was n't going to be so charitable this time. The bondholders were wiped out, and I was left with nothing but a little more wisdom and a loss to declare on my taxes. And, probably, another piece of junk mail.

<HEAD>Cautious and Uncertain: The Outlook at a Boutique</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A customer at <LOCATION> Osidi </LOCATION>, a small <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> boutique, held a mini-debate with herself: Should she spend $ 35 on a scarf or save the money for a different item of clothing? <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>, the store's owner, listened to the soliloquy. She's heard a lot of that kind of second-guessing from customers lately `` People are getting very discriminating in what they are buying,'' she said. Customer caution has made it hard for Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> to get a handle on how business will fare this year. But she knows this much: If customers are playing it safe, she had better do the same. <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON>, a moderate-priced clothing store named after one of Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>'s friends, is in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s residential <LOCATION> Gramercy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> section southeast of midtown. The boutique's customers, for the most part, are working women who live in the largely middle-class neighborhood. Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>'s customers have grown increasingly uncertain about the economy over the last two years, and she's watched her business change dramatically and unpredictably. `` 1988 was a very bad year for 98 percent of the people I came in contact with,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> said shortly after New Year's. She included herself in the majority. The holiday spirit seemed to pass Osidi by. While the season had some bright spots, business never really took off, even in the final week before Christmas when many other retailers enjoyed a last-minute surge. `` It was not a good Christmas season,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> said. `` The whole attitude of people was just to get it over with.'' Yet, in the first days of 1989, the mood of her customers seemed to pick up and business improved. Several new lines of red, black and navy sportswear just about blew out the door. One woman spent $ 200 one Saturday morning on several pieces, and returned that afternoon for more. Customers snapped up a rack of hand-painted scarves that sold for $ 35 apiece. Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> filled it with new stock that disappeared just as fast. Jewelry cases also had to be refilled. `` I have a good feeling about spring,'' she said in mid-January. `` I have the feeling that people are going to start opening up their pocketbooks soon.'' But two weeks later, a slow Saturday was a reminder of how fickle the retail business can be. Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> shook her head as she counted the day's receipts and talked again about the economy. Her outlook appears to move in tandem with sales, yet Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>'s underlying optimism seems to keep her going. Even when she sensed customers were feeling down during the holidays, she knew they'd buy again. `` You go through a cycle of emotional depression,'' she said. `` You withdraw for a while _ and then you come out.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON>'s understanding of her customers may be the secret of her success and <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON>'s ability to weather uncertainty. She gets to know the women who enter the store, talks with them, treats them like friends. People walking into <PERSON> Osidi </PERSON> are met with a smile. Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> asks regulars how last night's party went or how work is going. One woman, who had promised to stop by several days earlier but did n't, was greeted with a concerned `` Where were you?'' That kind of rapport keeps them coming back. `` They kept me in business this past year,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> said of her regulars, and it helps her gauge how confident shoppers feel and what merchandise they might buy. Their caution has led Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> to sell a different type of clothing than in the past. She used to buy entire ensembles that would sell for several hundred dollars. These days, accessories and mix-and-match skirts, sweaters and slacks are her staples. Osidi offers fewer lines of clothing, priced lower than the merchandise of past years. The shift also has led Mrs. <PERSON> Massa </PERSON> to have some merchandise made to order. She's no stranger to that end of the apparel industry, having been a manufacturer before she opened her store four years ago. `` It's more economical to do it yourself,'' she said. By creating the specifications for her own merchandise, she is sure to get the kinds of fabrics and colors she knows will sell. The watchword for this venture is caution _ the same caution she's applying to her store. `` We'll see how it goes,'' she said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Share prices closed broadly higher in active trading Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, as the market resumed its steep climb after a brief pause earlier this week. At the close of trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 26.5 points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,069.9. The 100-share index was up as much as 34.6 points at midday. At its lowest, the index was up 3.8 points at the opening. Stock was still in short supply, and that accentuated the gains, dealers said. In addition, shares were led higher by a brisk run in the stock futures market, which dealers said ignited a sharp jump in equity prices shortly after the opening. `` Once again the futures did seem to lead the market up,'' a dealer said. `` There was no way -LRB- the market -RRB- was going to stay down.'' Volume expanded to 768.7 million shares from 571.2 million on Thursday. Wall Street's resilience to apparently negative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures also encouraged the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market to advance, dealers said. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials opened lower following news that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> employment gained at a faster-than-expected rate in January. But a turnaround by the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> index into positive territory spurred the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market to hold on to most of its early gains. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was up 21.2 points at 1,689.0 at the close. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 500-share index rose 16.46 points to close at 1,167.78.

 The dollar closed little changed Friday after central banks choked off a rally in the currency brought on by bullish news on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. After a strong surge after the release of the economic reports, the dollar ended narrowly higher against the West German mark and British pound but lower against the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar. Gold prices, after dipping as low as $ 387 a troy ounce, ended up slightly higher. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 391.50 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, up from $ 391.10 late Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said non-farm payrolls rose by 408,000 jobs in January, well above market expectations.

 Federal authorities are increasing their pressure on traders and brokers in an effort to win cooperation in their investigation of fraud in the world's two largest commodities exchanges, sources said Friday. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> has shown some futures traders evidence of at least one type of trading offense and has invited them to share information in exchange for immunity from prosecution, reduced charges or a recommendation for a lenient sentence, say attorneys for some of those subpoenaed over the past two weeks. The pressure increasingly applied being to selected traders and brokers is helping to sharpen the focus of the government's two-year undercover investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> of the Trade and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the lawyers said. `` It tells me they need cooperation,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Troelstrup </PERSON>, an attorney with a number of clients who have been contacted by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. `` It tells me that the eerie feeling that they're not focusing on anything more than a routine trade-practices investigation may be on the mark,'' he said. <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the northern district of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, has refused to confirm the existence of the investigation, which was disclosed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 19. Speculation about the purpose of the probe has ranged from rooting out trading fraud to documenting the laundering of drug money. Defense lawyers said federal prosecutors have shown some traders evidence of `` bag trading.'' In the illegal technique, a floor broker conspires with another trader _ the `` bag man'' _ to sell a customer's futures contract at the low end of an official price range and to buy it back for a different customer at the high end of the range. The transaction produces a profit for the bag man, which he splits with his trading. Futures are binding contracts for delivery of a commodity at a specified price on a specified date. Producers and consumers of commodities use the futures markets to lock in prices in advance, while speculators use them to bet on price movements. Prosecutors also have told some brokers or their attorneys they were prepared to accept `` proffer letters,'' from people under investigation, defense attorneys said. In a proffer letter, a potential defendant lays out the information he is willing to provide in exchange for immunity, a lesser charge or prosecutor's recommendation for leniency. If no such deal is struck, prosecutors agree not to use the information to prosecute the individual. One lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said proffer letters were fairly routine in criminal investigations. But <PERSON> Troelstrup </PERSON> said it was unusual for federal authorities to let it be known publicly, albeit through unofficial channels, that they were willing to negotiate plea bargains. The government also is seeking handwriting samples from some of those subpoenaed by asking them to write down the trading-badge numbers of certain other traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, defense lawyers said. <PERSON> Troelstrup </PERSON> said federal authorities may want to compare the handwriting samples with the handwriting on trading cards obtained by subpoena. Futures traders record on trading cards the price, quantity, time and badge number of the opposing buyer or seller for each trade they make. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> officials were drafting a document that would prohibit floor brokers from trading both for their own accounts and on behalf of customers. Dual trading, which is unique to futures markets, has been criticized as inviting trading abuse. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> would not confirm the report, saying only that dual trading was one of the issues being examined by an internal committee formed earlier this week to make recommendations to the exchange's board of directors. In a statement unrelated to the investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had fined <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, a trader in the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit, $ 50,000 for making pre-arranged trades.

 <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> disclosed Friday it has agreed to pay $ 2 million to four former owners of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant so that they wo n't sue the utility over its management of the stalled project. The agreement is part of a deal under which <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which sought bankruptcy protection a year ago because of its 36 percent <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> share, would assume $ 30 million in plant payments being skipped by the owner of the fourth-largest share, <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In return for making <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>'s payments _ which would keep the project afloat through May 1990 _ <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> wanted all present and former <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> owners to agree not to sue it. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> denies mismanaging the project but says it wants to avoid expensive litigation over it. <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which formerly owned 6 percent of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> and initially refused to waive its right to sue <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, now has signed on. But <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> _ which own a total of about 4 percent of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> _ wo n't go along, <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> confirmed Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy judge, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON>, must approve the agreement for assuming the <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION> payments, and the utility on Friday told him how it got <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and the other former owners to sign on. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 1.2 million in cash to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bangor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ashooh </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also would waive $ 800,000 in debt from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Those companies sold their <ORGANIZATION> Seabrook </ORGANIZATION> shares, totaling 12 percent of the project, to a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> disclosed some details of its <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> funding deal as it asked <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> for another extension of the deadline for the project's past and present owners to file claims against it in bankruptcy court. <PERSON> Yacos </PERSON> previously had granted three extensions of the deadline for claims against <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and said last month there would be `` no further extensions'' beyond Feb. 9. But on Friday he granted one more extension, to Feb. 24. <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, its pricetag now $ 5.8 billion, was completed in July 1986 but remains idle because of problems with finances and evacuation planning. <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 12 percent of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>, stopped making payments of about $ 1.5 million a month to the project last summer. Plant officials initially said they hoped to complete arrangements for assuming $ 30 million of <ORGANIZATION> MMWEC </ORGANIZATION>'s payments by Sept. 15. An interim funding arrangment expired Nov. 30; plant officials say some owners have been making the payments since, but they wo n't give specifics The federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled in December that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s financial problems do not pose a safety concern for low-power atomic tests, but appeared to leave the issue open for commercial licensing. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials hope to start low-power tests within the next month and gain a commercial license by year end.

 Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks rose 5.6 percent in late January, bolstered by a strong performance by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and continued solid truck sales, the manufacturers reported Friday. One analyst suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s 14.8 percent increase in sales of domestically made cars may stem from late-January fleet sales. Fleet customers include all those who buy more than 10 vehicles a year, such as rental car companies, police forces and firms that provide employees with cars. The automakers reported they sold cars and light trucks at a daily rate of 41,798 vehicles during the Jan. 21-31 period this year, compared with a rate of 39,571 during the same period a year ago. Car sales were up 5.3 percent, based on <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s performance, and truck sales rose 6.3 percent during the period, in which there were nine selling days both years. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s U.S.-made car sales rose 2.1 percent while <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s fell 11.9 percent in late January compared with the same period last year. `` I think there might have been a little blip in their number from fleets,'' said analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` You normally see that in the latter part of the year.'' Sales in December of last year were very strong while the car-selling market softened somewhat in the first part of January. `` There is still a great deal of concern that strong fleet sales throughout the fourth quarter may have been masking some possible deterioration in the retail marketplace,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said. Another analyst, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Healy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the domestic car market _ about 30.7 percent _ is nearly the same as it has been lately. `` I think if you take the month as a whole, the weak early January and the late strength, I think if you smooth out the last few months, car sales are a little weaker,'' he said. `` But there's so much noise in these numbers that it's hard to tell. Industry-wide, car and truck sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped 5 percent during January. Sales of imported vehicles dropped 18.2 percent while sales of vehicles made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fell 0.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said its car sales rose 14.8 percent during the period to a daily rate of 8,426 during late January this year, compared with a daily rate of 7,339 during the same time last year. Meantime, sales of U.S.-made trucks by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> rose 4.9 percent to a daily rate of 5,115 this year from a rate of 4,873 during late January last year. For the entire month, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales have risen 3.6 percent while its truck sales increased 4.9 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> showed the biggest decline in late-January car sales, dipping 11.9 percent to a daily rate of 3,180 this year compared with a rate of 3,607 last year. But truck sales for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> led the Big Three, going up 8.1 percent in late January 1989 to a rate of 3,452 compared with a rate of 3,193 last year. For all of January this year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were 6.7 percent lower than January last year, while truck sales were up 12 percent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said its car sales rose 2.1 percent in late January, to a daily rate of 12,899 this year from a rate of 12,631 last year. Truck sales rose 4.1 percent to a daily rate of 5,213 this year from 5,009 last year. For the month, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> sold 11.1 percent fewer cars this year compared with last year and 1.7 percent more trucks.

 Stock prices were little changed Friday in a indecisive appraisal of stronger-than-expected employment growth at the start of 1989. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.50 to 2,331.25, reducing its gain for the week to 8.39 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 792 up, 642 down and 518 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 172.98 million shares, down from 183.43 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 207.15 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday morning that payroll employment grew by 408,000 jobs in January, well above advance estimates on Wall Street. That evidence of continued strong momentum in economic growth quickly increased expectations of further credit-tightening by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. However, traders' fears of higher interest rates apparently were offset to a significant extent by the dollar's rise in foreign exchange after the report was issued. A sustained rally by the dollar would stand to attract money from overseas into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments. Brokers also said money managers who had been left behind in the market's recent rally were still engaged in `` catch-up'' buying each time stock prices pulled back a bit. <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> climbed 2 to 55 | in active trading The company, which is opposing a $ 52-a-share takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said it would solicit offers from others in an effort to get a better price. <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> gained 3 to 95 -LCB-, trading at new 52-week highs. The company reported fourth quarter earnings of $ 1.24 a share, up from 96 cents a share in the comparable period a year earlier. Elsewhere among the blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> gained -LCB- to 109; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> rose -LRB- to 32 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> dropped | to 127 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> lost \ to 47 ~ Some airline issues added to their recent gains. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> rose -RCB- to 57 ~; <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> 2 | to 62, and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- to 3 But <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LRB- to 123 | Japanese stocks gained ground as the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market hit another new high. <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> picked up 2 -LCB- to 195 -LCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> \ to 163. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 3.25 billion, or 0.11 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks edged up .15 to 166.50. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose .22 to 343.84, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up .13 at 296.97 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained 1.19 to 406.35, climbing back above its close on the eve of Black Monday Oct. 19, 1987.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Down Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices fell slightly in active trading Friday as the market shrugged off inflationary fears triggered by a government unemployment report indicating robust economic expansion. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond fell \ point, or about $ 2.50 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.83 percent from 8.80 percent late Thursday. Analysts said the bond market climbed in afternoon trading after an early sell-off in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that 408,000 new nonfarm jobs were created last month, well above expectations of about 300,000. The report was viewed as a sign of rapid economic expansion, triggering some inflationary fears, analysts said. But many traders attributed the increase to unseasonably warm January weather that created more construction jobs. `` The market seems to want to be fairly strong,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandross </PERSON>, chief economist with <ORGANIZATION> Lloyds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Part of the rise of employment was excused away because of the weather and its impact on construction.'' He said the market also was buoyed by rumors that the weekly nationwide survey of purchasing managers, a key economic indicator released on Mondays, would show a lower reading, implying an economic slowdown. But <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, director of money market research at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the employment data were strong enough to force the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> to raise short-term interest rates to slow the economy as a hedge against higher inflation. `` Even if you exclude -LRB- construction -RRB- you see a very buoyant set of labor data and it does suggest the economy is taking a strong tick in the new year,'' he said. `` Against that data I would look for some tightening in credit policy.'' In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments fell 3-16 point, intermediate maturities fell 3-16 point and long-term issues also were down 3-16 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.90 to 1,137.90. In corporate trading, industrials inched up. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.04 to 299.77. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was down 3-32 point at 92 5-32. The average yield to maturity rose to 7.57 percent from 7.56 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.76 percent as the discount rose nine basis points to 8.47 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 9.01 percent as the discount rose 11 basis points to 8.52 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.14 percent as the discount rose 11 basis points to 8.47 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was unchanged at 9 percent.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Steel to Close Wire Rope Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will close its wire rope division in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, cutting 250 jobs, because the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would not grant early approval for selling the plant to a competitor. `` We believe the planned transaction was entirely appropriate so that timely clearance should have been granted,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Funk </PERSON>, division president. `` An authorization by the commission would have permitted an orderly transfer of the <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION> plant to -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bridon </ORGANIZATION> American -RRB-. This would have allowed <ORGANIZATION> Bridon </ORGANIZATION> to complete the purchase, to maintain many local jobs and to minimize the impact on our customers and the area's economy,'' <PERSON> Funk </PERSON> said in a statement. The commission rejected an early termination of its investigation into possible antitrust implications of the deal <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> announced in September.

<HEAD>Copper's Slide Continues On Perceieved Easing Of Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices fell markedly Friday, the fourth significant decline in the last five trading sessions, on perceptions of easing labor tensions in several copper-producing countries and expectations of an increase in supplies. On other markets, precious-metals futures prices rose; agricultural futures were mostly higher; and energy futures retreated. Copper settled 1.35 cents to 2.50 cents lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.3235 a pound The spot February contract finished at $ 1.34 a pound, the lowest spot copper price on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> since Oct. 13 and more than 30 cents below the record high of $ 1.6475 a pound reached on Dec. 8. The March contract lost nearly 10 percent of its value during the past week. The setback was largely a reaction to labor settlements that averted refinery strikes in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` Not only were these -LRB- labor problems -RRB- resolved, they were resolved in a very short period of time, and that caught a lot of people off guard,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar's strength during the week, effectively raising the price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods to foreign buyers, also weighed on copper prices, analysts said. But experts said demand for copper remained strong and at least one analyst cautioned that labor tensions in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> have not disappeared. `` You can always bandage a cut, but if you have internal hemorrhaging you can still die,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Anagnos </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold and silver futures posted modest gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in lackluster trading Gold settled 40 cents to 80 cents higher with April at $ 396.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.2 cents to 1.3 cents higher with March at $ 5.875 a troy ounce. Wheat and soybean futures closed moderately higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in late buying partially prompted by a report that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had ordered the evacuation of 20 villages contaminated by radiation from the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident. The wire-service report said residents of the unidentified Ukrainian farming communities had not previously been informed of the radiation leak and had been living and growing crops in highly contaminated soil. The Chernobyl incident sparked a sharp rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain futures in 1986 on fears of widespread contamination of Soviet crops. No new radiation leakage was reported on Friday `` but when you start hearing rumors of leakage of radiation, people start thinking ` Chernobyl' and ` Are we going to have another incident,''' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of floor operations for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn futures closed mixed while oats were slightly higher. Wheat settled -RCB- cent to 3 cents higher with March at $ 4.30 \ bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.71 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with March at $ 2.18 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 10 \ cents higher with March at $ 7.70 -LCB- The arctic cold front chilling the nation's midsection prompted new buying of livestock and meat futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in anticipation of weight losses and possibly some livestock deaths. Live cattle settled .18 cent to .48 cent higher with February at 75.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent lower to .20 cent higher with March at 84.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .28 cent to .62 cent higher with February at 44.02 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent to 1.80 cents higher with February at 40.82 cents a pound. Energy futures prices slipped on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in thin trading. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 20 cents to 46 cents lower with March at $ 17.53 a barrel; heating oil was .24 cent to .54 cent lower with March at 50.31 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .45 cent to 1.10 cents lower with March at 49.17 cents a gallon.

 Maybe somebody should send <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> to their rooms until they cool off. In the latest volley of the cola wars, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is running a new commercial tweaking Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s recent 3-D ads and disputing claims about how many <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> drinkers are switching to Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> fired back, saying its campaign to position third-ranked <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> as a challenger to regular <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s spot as the nation's No. 2 soft drink `` apparently has set off a panic at <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` We've struck a sensitive chord,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beindorff </PERSON>, vice president for Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>. That's not the way <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> sees it. Spokesman <PERSON> Tod </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKenzie </PERSON> said late Friday it appeared that <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s new ads scored `` a solid right to the corporate chin'' with its ads attacking the credibility of <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s claims. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> has complained about <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s ad claims to the three major television networks, which are reviewing them. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> says it plans to complain to the networks about <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s new ad, which began running Thursday night. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, publisher of the trade newsletter <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, said the attention that the two soft drink giants are paying to their diet colas illustrates the growing importance of the diet segment of the $ 43 billion retail soda market as the population ages and becomes more weight conscious. Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> started the latest exchange with commercials on last month's broadcast of the Super Bowl football game that took the unusual approach of going against regular <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> rather than Diet Pepsi. `` Last year, nearly two million families stopped buying <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and more of them moved to Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> than any other major soft drink,'' the ads say. The campaign theme is `` The move is on to <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'' and the ads employ `` Miami Vice'' star <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an ex-Pepsi pitchman, to reinforce the point. The ads attracted heightened attention because they first aired in connection with <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s sponsorship of the Super Bowl halftime show, the first live network broadcast in three-dimensions. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottlers distributed about 20 million pairs of special glasses so viewers could get the 3-D effect in both the show and an ad for Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s claim was misleading because millions of families switch to other brands every year, and asked the networks to pull the ads or demand modifications. According to the trade newsletter Beverage Digest, <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s market share fell 0.1 percentage point to 18.7 percent in 1988, while Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and its caffeine-free version rose to 10.2 percent from 9.4 percent in 1987 and <ORGANIZATION> Diet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> and its caffeine-free version rose to 6.6 percent from 6.1 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> also developed an ad that it began airing Thursday on network TV. It shows a man making a presentation in a boardroom, his back to the camera as he gestures at a chart that shows Diet Coke sales rising. As the presentation proceeds, a narrator says, `` Last year, two million families stopped buying Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> and over a million new families started buying Diet Pepsi. So what's giving Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION> such a distorted view?'' The answer becomes obvious, as the man turns toward the camera, wearing 3-D glasses. `` Gentlemen, I trust we are all seeing this the same way,'' he said as viewers see the other executives are also wearing the 3-D glasses. <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON> said there are elements of truth in both campaigns. Diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>'s market share closed the lead on regular <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> last year, he said. But by some measures, he said <PERSON> Diet </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepsi </PERSON> has grown more rapidly than Diet Coke. But, he added, `` You ca n't have ` cola wars' without skirmishes.''

 The resignations of four top executives at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> are a blow to attempts by <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to stem internal problems at the venerable investment firm, analysts said Friday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, head of investment banking at the securities firm and the highest-ranking senior <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> executive, was among the four resignations announced Thursday. Kidder sources said more departures were expected at the nation's 15th-largest securities firm The latest resignations came less than two weeks after <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> named one of its own executives to head <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, prompting the resignation of 20-year veteran <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had been running the securities group's daily operations. In a statement, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> said Friday the departures were `` understandable'' because of disagreements over new directions for 124-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION>. `` While it is disappointing to note the recent departure of several <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> officials, employment changes following receipt of bonuses is not an unusual occurrence in the securities industry,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossidy </PERSON>, vice chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s financial services unit. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> has experienced internal disenchantment, corporate embarrassment at its involvement in the Wall Street insider trading scandal, and a loss of stature and clients since <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> bought an 80 percent stake in the firm in 1986. `` The presence of GE and some of the decisions that have resulted has contributed to some of the problems,'' said <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, who follows the securities industry for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` They've had numerous management changes and repeated changes in strategy. The other executives who left Thursday are <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, co-head of mergers and acquisitions; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostrander </PERSON>, a managing director who worked on new business development; and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, managing director of mortgage trading. <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Friday he had difficulty maintaining confidence among his bankers because of perceived inequities in compensation. `` The real linchpin of the decision was that I think that Kidder-GE can ultimately succeed. However, there are a number of fundamental structural and cultural differences between the two organizations that need to be addressed,'' he said. Kidder sources said there is widespread dissatisfaction at the firm with reductions in employee bonuses, plus a conflict between <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> management and <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>'s investment bankers over the department's strategy Analysts said the recent senior management changes by <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> reflected the parent company's desire to exert greater control over <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION>'s day-to-day operations, as well as <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s latest attempt to deal with difficulties posed by the firm. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, the former executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> who was named <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>'s president and chief executive officer two weeks ago, declined to comment directly on the impact of <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>'s departure. `` While we regret his decision, he leaves behind a strong organization that will continue to function as an important part of this firm,'' <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>'s reputation was tainted when it became embroiled in the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal. The firm agreed in 1987 to pay a then-record $ 25.3 million to settle civil charges with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. GE made a number of high-level management changes at <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> following the settlement, in what was seen as an attempt to repair what GE perceived as management weaknesses that led to <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION>'s involvement in the scandal <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> said the publicity over insider trading and <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> had made it more difficult for <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON> to sign on new clients. `` There comes a point when all the press and all the uncertainty over the GE-Kidder situation causes directors to start to question the wisdom of management. It just wears you down. It makes you play defense,'' he said.

 Energy futures prices slumped Friday amid conflicting reports from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the March contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, lost 20 cents to close the day at $ 17.53 a barrel. The contract had settled 22 cents higher on Thursday after flipflopping earlier in the week. Other contract months also fell. Heating oil and unleaded gasoline prices were among the refined products that declined on the exchange. The March contract for domestic heating oil settled 0.24 cent lower at 50.31 cents a gallon, while unleaded gasoline closed down 0.45 cent at 49.17 cents a gallon. Analysts said crude prices had risen on Thursday, spurred by a report in an Arabic-language newspaper that <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> was considering a 10 percent cut in its oil production starting March 1. A second report on Friday contradicting the earlier statements pushed prices down, said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president of energy investments at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It shows the market is still very prone to rumors,'' <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON> said Thursday's report had been perceived as positive because it suggested <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> was willing to cooperate to help stabilize world oil prices. <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> has refused to cut its production since the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>' new quota system took effect Jan. 1. <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> is one of several emirates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, one of the 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations. Experts estimate the <ORGANIZATION> UAE </ORGANIZATION> is exceeding its quota by about 400,000 barrels a day. It was assigned a quota of 988,000 barrels out of a total 18.5 million barrels for the entire cartel. Investors have remained skittish despite <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s new agreement because in the past the cartel has had problems sticking to similar accords. Although prices have risen fairly steadily since Jan. 1, recent reports indicate that several members of the cartel are continuing to overproduce. Analysts said the latest reports from <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> provided further evidence that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement remains shaky.

<HEAD>Administration Assures Allies of Commitment to Lowering Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration assured <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> allies Friday of the president's commitment to lowering the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit but no decisions were reached on a new approach to the troubling issue of Third World debt, participants in the discussions said. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was the host for the administration's first international gathering, said the discussions had been productive with participants expressing the general view that the global economy is peforming well. The meetings, involving finance ministers and central bank presidents of the industrial world's largest economies _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ were billed as a get-acquainted session for the new administration to present its ideas on international matters. Participants said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> assured the other nations of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s commitment to lowering the budget deficit, promising to reduce the deficit by more than $ 60 billion in the next fiscal year, which begins on Oct. 1. A senior <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, briefing reporters on condition that his name not be used, said <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> stressed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was working to cooperate with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in finding a successful approach to reducing the deficit. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> told reporters that the effort to better coordinate economic policies between countries was working well with the participants holding a `` positive view'' about the current state of the global economy. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said that the seven countries also had a `` thorough discussion'' regarding the $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden. `` Several ideas were discussed for strengthening the agreed-on strategy based on the same principles that we consider valid,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. The meetings lasted for 11 hours over Thursday and Friday. Canadian Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told reporters that a number of proposals on Third World debt had been reviewed, including recommendations by the Japanese and the French for liberalized lending policies. `` We looked at a number of options that have been put on the table,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` We looked at options today and that will continue, but no decisions were made.'' French Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>, briefing reporters, said that <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> gave the group assurances that the new administration viewed reducing the budget deficit as `` very important.'' The deficit, which is expected to reach $ 161 billion this year, has long been a source of unhappiness for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies who blame it for siphoning off capital needed for investment in their own countries. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> assured the finance ministers that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intended to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction targets, which call for a deficit of $ 100 billion in 1990 declining to zero by 1993. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will present his own budget plans before a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next Thursday. A Canadian official, briefing reporters on the condition that the official's name not be used, said that there was skepticism about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` flexible freeze'' approach to reducing the deficit through spending restraint, without the aid of new taxes. The Canadian official said that there were doubts about the optimistic economic assumptions underpinning the flexible freeze, especially projections of sharp declines in interest rates. Officials said that in addition to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit, the finance officials discussed the apparent stall in further improvements in huge world trade imbalances. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> trade deficit, after posting big improvements early in 1988, has been frozen over the past six months while the Japanese and West German trade surpluses have begun rising again. Officials said that the countries remained committed to the economic policy coordination process begun by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who is now secretary of state in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. They said that this process still held out the best hope of narrowing the trade differences by keeping currency rates from fluctuating. Unlike past sessions of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION>, as the countries are known, this week's meetings were held during a period of relative calm in currency markets. The dollar, which has undergone periods of heavy selling pressure over the past two years, has strengthened and in fact the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and central banks of the other countries have been selling dollars to keep it from appreciating too much in value in relation to other currencies. Officials indicated that no consideration had been given to changing the trading ranges established for the dollar and other currencies. When the currencies trade outside those ranges, central banks engage in a process known as intervention, the massive buying or selling of a currency by a government to influence its price. On Third World debt, the countries discussed modifications to the so-called <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan, which has governed handling of the $ 1.3 trillion Third World debt burden since <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> unveiled it in September 1985. The discussions focused on ways to encourage commercial banks to voluntarily reduce the debt they hold. Officials predicted the negotiations would continue with the hope that concrete proposals could be unveiled at the spring meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled from March 31 to April 4 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged to review the American policy on Third World debt. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has found itself increasingly isolated on the debt issue as political stresses have increased in debtor countries suffering declining standards of living as they struggled to meet a rising burden of loan repayments.

<HEAD>Bic To Market $5 French Perfume In Supermarkets</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is confident about plans to market a $ 5 French spritz perfume alongside its ballpoint pens, throwaway razors and cigarette lighters, but some fragrance experts think the idea stinks. <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> officially will inaugurate its new product next month in the same retailers where it sells the other items, and an advertising campaign will start in early April, <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> DuPuy </PERSON> said Friday. The quarter-ounce spray perfumes _ to be called <PERSON> Jour </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Nuit </ORGANIZATION> _ will be offered at a price comparable to that of cologne, a much less concentrated form of fragrance. Bic, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION>, launched the perfume business a year ago in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> with a new $ 25 million factory. <PERSON> Firmenich </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s top four fragrance makers, is supplying the essences for Parfum Bic. European sales have been strong, according to company officials and cosmetic analysts. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Parfum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> will be sold in the usual Bic outlets: drug stores, discount stores, supermarkets, convenience stores. `` The concept is vintage Bic. If you, as a consumer, have an opportunity to buy perfume for a price which is less than you might spend on toilet water, would there be much reason not to?'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebowitz </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But others had doubts. J.T. <PERSON> Botindari </PERSON>, fragrance buyer at <LOCATION> Colonial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drug </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, calls the planned <ORGANIZATION> Parfum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bic </ORGANIZATION> a `` junky idea.'' He said the success of the product will depend `` on how sophisticated your buyer is and whether he wants to buy perfume from a company that makes lighter fluid.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm, said other failed efforts to market low-budget perfumes included one by <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1980s. He said one of the problems is pilferage, and another is that $ 5 may be more than women may want to spend for such a product in a supermarket or convenience store. `` If they are successful, they will be the first,'' <PERSON> Salzman </PERSON> said. `` It's been tried. It's very tough. My visceral reaction is that, if it is ultimately successful, it will be an uphill battle. It might be more expensive than Bic thinks.'' `` This is the same thing people told us about shavers,'' <PERSON> DuPuy </PERSON> responded. `` No one has been able to combine this quality and this price and this packaging.''
