 A helicopter crashed Tuesday on the median of an expressway, killing the pilot, co-pilot and three <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino hotel executives of the Trump Organization, officials said. The helicopter was returning to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when it crashed at 1:50 p.m. on the Garden State Parkway, police said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, said he was camping nearby when he saw the helicopter as its `` rotor stopped spinning and became disconnected from the helicopter and tumbled.'' He said, `` It seemed like an eternity watching it'' plummet to the ground. State police Sgt. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aceto </PERSON> said the main rotor was found about a quarter-mile north of the crash site. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghiorsi </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said a search was under way for the tail rotor. Investigators said the loss of one rotor could have caused the other to fall off. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klores </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was not aboard the copter, but the presidents of his Trump Plaza and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s Castle casino hotels died in the crash. <PERSON> Klores </PERSON> identified the <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> executives as <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, 43, chief executive officer of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casino operations; <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Etess </PERSON>, 38, president of the Taj Mahal casino project; and, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Benanav </PERSON>, 33, senior vice president of Trump Plaza casino hotel. `` They were three fabulous young men in the prime of their lives,'' said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> in a statement issued through his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` No better human beings ever existed. We're deeply saddened by this devastating tragedy. Our hearts go out to their families.'' State police spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> identified the other victims as pilot <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ronkonkoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and co-pilot <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Diener </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitaliere </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the helicopter was an <ORGANIZATION> Agusta </ORGANIZATION> 109A, which seats eight people. The Trump executives had been in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a news conference promoting the Feb. 3 World Boxing Organization bout between junior welterweights <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vinny </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazienza </PERSON> at <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s Plaza. Ocean County Sheriff <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhemus </PERSON> said his office has confirmed five people died in the crash. `` There was a lot of debris smack in the center of the Garden State -LRB- Parkway -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitaliere </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Klores </PERSON> said the helicopter was leased by the Trump Organization from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, and had taken off from a heliport in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> for the one-hour flight to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

 The family of <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was cited for failing to obtain a building permit before starting construction of a temporary tomb for the former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president, city officials said Tuesday. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Muraoka </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the citation was sent out Tuesday, the day after building inspectors visited the site at Valley of the Temples Memorial Park in <LOCATION> Windward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>.

 The matriarch of one of the world's most sorely tried political families said Tuesday she still sometimes thinks of her daughter, Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, as `` my baby.'' Madame <PERSON> Nusrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, widow of executed Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, herself is senior minister _ the equivalent of deputy prime minister _ and she conducts Cabinet meetings in her daughter's absence. `` As the wife of a prime minister,'' she said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, `` there was not much I could do, but as a mother, sometimes I feel she is still my baby and needs me and I am ready to help as much as I can.'' <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is standing in for her daughter, delivering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s speech to the present General Assembly. Diplomats said her daughter's 10-month-old government is embattled and the prime minister dared not leave at this time. The mother denied a report that her daughter is in political trouble to the extent that she telephoned President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for help in fighting her enemies. `` No, the report is stupid, it is lies, none of it is true,'' <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was hanged for conspiracy to commit murder by his rival, Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, in April 1979. Madame <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was imprisoned in solitary confinement for three years, but formed the <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> in 1981. She reportedly suffered from cancer and went abroad for treatment for years, returning in 1988. Her two sons, Mir <PERSON> Murtaza </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, and the younger <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> formed an anti-Zia organization based in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> called Al-Zulfikar, after their father. It was branded a terrorist organization, outlawed in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the sons were exiled. Both married Afghan women. The organization claimed responsibility for the killing of the official who signed <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s execution order in 1979. Four years ago, <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> under mysterious circumstances. His mother says he was poisoned by Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s supporters. Reports said he carried a vial of poison in case he was apprehended by enemies. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> himself died in a plane crash in August 1988. The surviving <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> son now is living in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> at an undisclosed location, with a second wife whom he married last March, his mother said. Observers said he waits to return home to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and that his sister, the prime minister, is considering how to deal with his situation. Another child, the prime minister's younger sister <LOCATION> Sanam </LOCATION>, is a housewife living with her British husband in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` We always taught our children the difference between right and wrong,'' <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said. The daughters especially loved their father, the boys learned to be tough, she said. `` We said the only thing they leave behind is their good name.''

<HEAD>Star Wars Backers Seek Stronger Administration Support of Defense

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must `` put a line in the sand'' to head off further funding cuts for <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, say the missile defense system's hard-core backers who seek a sharper administration view of the program's purpose. These Republican lawmakers _ who bristle at use of the term Star Wars rather than the formal <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> _ say <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must act now as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators thrash out the defense budget for fiscal 1990. `` We need them to weigh in on this conference,'' Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview last week `` The administration has to put a line in the sand on what is not acceptable to them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unless the administration is willing to come out and do something, it's going to continue to go downhill.'' Star Wars, introduced six years ago by then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as a nuclear-age antidote to a strike against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has suffered a series of blows in recent months. In early August, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> slashed $ 1.8 billion from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request of $ 4.9 billion for the program in fiscal 1990. The vote was 248-175, reflecting waning support for the program. Last month Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's SDI `` astrodome'' approach to protect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` political jargon.'' Star Wars opponents cited these comments as an indication the administration does not have its heart in the program; proponents say the vice president's remarks were taken out of context. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> recently has moved to emphasize his support for the program. In a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> interview last weekend, the vice president urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> not to cut Star Wars funding. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said little about Star Wars, but <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> insisted the president `` is a strong supporter of the Strategic Defense Initiative.'' Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> slashed $ 900 million from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, but later reversed field and restored $ 600 million. That move was viewed not as an increase in support for Star Wars but rather the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to strengthen its bargaining position with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. During negotiations, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> conferees have pushed for a Star Wars budget around $ 3.5 billion, far below the $ 4.1 billion spent on the program in fiscal 1989. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has favored a total closer to the $ 4.3 billion approved last week. In the wake of these events, the Republican disenchantment shows up in various forms. Wallop criticized the contact between the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, saying `` their congressional liaison is less than competent. They -LRB- the administration -RRB- are being told things that basically guided them elsewhere.'' `` The general tenor of their legislative liaison is to be a supporter once the crisis has arisen. Those of us trying to help have been frustrated by that,'' the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Republican said. Pressed for specific names, <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> declined to identify them. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewey </PERSON>, who handles legislative issues for the SDI organization at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, said his office has been `` very supportive, right along. We have n't given up _ by no means. Nobody in our organization gives that impression.'' Another Pentagon official, who spoke on condition he not be identified, said he was `` a little taken aback'' by the senator's comments, and emphasized that `` we've worked the heck out of it and will continue to. Wallop said this week would be an ideal time for the administration to indicate the total fiscal 1990 budget it will accept for Star Wars, and he expressed his confidence that a former <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> lawmaker, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, will make that point clear. `` It's hard to fight for people who do n't have a target over which to fight,'' the senator said. Another SDI supporter, Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., said he was looking to <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to keep the program highly visible When asked if the administration has done enough to promote the program, <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, after a long pause, responded, `` probably not.'' `` Without administration support, the program will languish,'' said <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, who fears a substantial budget cut would `` emasculate'' the program. Rep. <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyl </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was not disappointed by the administration's efforts on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>, but said `` now is the time to weigh in

<HEAD>Cheating Scandal May Lead to Costlier Generics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers may soon be paying higher prices for prescription drugs as more generic products are pulled from the market and cost-conscious buyers are left with fewer low-priced options, some industry observers say. Dozens of drugs have been recalled in the wake of allegations and admissions of cheating on safety tests required for <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval. The scandal is likely to produce a shakeout in the industry and result in more rigorous safety testing required for approval. Some generic drug makers and industry observers say this will force prices up, but others say the industry will remain competitive enough to withstand the financial pressures without price increases. A more immediate concern for consumers, however, is the possible effect of the recalls. `` The costs to pharmacists are going up for selected products, but not overall,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Grote </PERSON>, vice president of purchasing for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The biggest impact of generic drug recalls may be seen by patients taking the high blood pressure drug Dyazide or its generic version. One of the drug's two clones was removed from the market earlier this year when its maker, <ORGANIZATION> Vitarine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, admitted cheating on safety tests to win <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval. Now the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is trying to remove the other generic version from the market, saying its maker, <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, misrepresented test data to the agency <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s product is about half the price of Dyazide, and its removal from the market would mean higher prices for some consumers, at least until another generic version can win <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> agreed to recall another drug, an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, after the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the company cheated on product safety tests. The drug is nitrofurantoin, sold under the brand name Macrodantin by <ORGANIZATION> Norwich-Eaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION>. Generic drugs, which account for about one-third of all prescriptions nationwide, now offer consumers savings averaging 50 percent to 70 percent over their brand-name counterparts. But some in the industry say the gap will narrow as the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> toughens regulations and as the industry itself consolidates. `` The prices for generics will show a gradual increase ... but still will be substantially below brand-name drugs,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Northvale </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, who with an investor group took the company out of bankruptcy last year and anticipates generic drug sales of $ 36 million to $ 40 million this year, also predicts an end to cutthroat pricing in the generic industry as companies realize that setting prices below costs to gain market share is unprofitable. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has no formal proposal for tougher regulations, but agency officials have been discussing the need for more staff, the possibility of imposing user fees on the generic industry for new drug application filings and more rigorous safety testing. `` All of those things will affect the cost of the generic drug,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blissenbach </PERSON>, director of pharmacy programs for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HealthCare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a Minneapolis-based manager of health maintenance organizations. But an official at <ORGANIZATION> Rugby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Center </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, disagrees. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeiger </PERSON>, executive vice president and general counsel of Rugby, a privately held generic drug maker said to be the largest in the country with about $ 500 million in annual sales, said the additional costs would not be enough to raise prices. `` It's a very competitive industry,'' he said. `` We do n't see the prices increasing at all.'' Analysts anticipate some generic manufacturers will not make it through the scandal. <PERSON> Hemant </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON>, a pharmaceutical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> HKS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, says more than half of the top 20 generic drug makers _ who account for 90 percent of the generic business _ will disappear within five years. `` But still the prices of generics probably are not going to rise because six or 10 companies are still enough for some form of pricing pressure,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 This war-battered city is cautiously coming to life again after six months of fierce artillery battles. Beirutis are picking up the pieces of their lives under a cease-fire that took hold Sept. 22. But for many, the memories of the nightmare that killed 900 people will not go away. Schoolteacher <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Khoury </PERSON> ate so much to calm her nerves during the fighting between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces that she ca n't get into her dresses now. Housewife <PERSON> Samia </PERSON> <PERSON> Iskandarani </PERSON> ca n't listen to the radio any more because it reminds her of fear-filled nights tuned to news flashes in her bunker. Another woman got hooked on sleeping pills during the shelling. While some people are having problems adjusting to a life without the fear of pulverizing bombardments, many are having fun while they can. The beaches that once were the playground of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are crowded again. Restaurants and bars are so full that customers have to make reservations. In Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> two weeks ago, when the city was largely deserted before the cease-fire, there was only one bar open. Movie theaters are open, screening action movies to people who by any stretch of the imagination should have had their fill of the real thing. Few people believe that the cease-fire will last or that Lebanese legislators meeting in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, to seek a settlement to the 14-year-old civil war will succeed. The Lebanese are grateful for the cease-fire. But after seeing hundreds of cease-fires collapse many consider this one nothing more than a respite in a conflict that has defied the peacemakers. They are returning to a normal life slowly and cautiously, if living amid the ruins with tightly rationed electricity and water can be called normal. `` I can only sleep if I take sleeping pills,'' said young Sunni Moslem woman who identified herself only as <PERSON> Ghada </PERSON>. `` It's the only way I can overcome my fear of being surprised by a shell during my sleep. It's a carry-over from the fighting. Ms. <PERSON> Iskandarani </PERSON>, a Moslem, said she has an aversion to radios these days: `` They're a reminder of the horrible days and nights we spent in the shelter waiting for news flashes to tell us where the shells were falling.'' Schools, offices and banks have reopened. Traffic around <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is so heavy during the day that one driver, stuck in a traffic jam, joked with the driver of the car next to her: `` I wish the war was still on. It kept the streets clear and I'd be home by now.'' The moneychangers are back on <LOCATION> Hamra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, the badly damaged center of the old commercial district in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Mostly they gather around a pile of stones outside a fast-food store, prompting local wags to dub the busy thoroughfare `` Wall Street.'' <PERSON> Samer </PERSON> <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON>, proprietor of the Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> pub across from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, said he wo n't remove the sandbags piled high outside his bar until a peace settlement is signed, sealed and delivered. `` Business is booming, but I do n't trust this truce,'' he said, echoing the feelings of most Beirutis. `` If there's no settlement I'll add more sandbags.'' Newspapers which a few weeks ago carried ads for 24-hour delivery of sandbags and cement blocks `` to protect your homes, shops and offices,'' now advertise repair services. People are making only essential repairs to their damaged houses, enough to make them habitable. Many are replacing broken windows with transparent plastic sheets. `` Why should I waste money fixing the whole place up?'' said <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, whose house in the seaside <LOCATION> Ein </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mreisseh </LOCATION> neighborhood of west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> took a direct hit from Christian artillery. `` I do n't believe in this cease-fire. Those deputies in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> should be slaughtered for all the good they've done in the last 14 years,'' he said as he bought a lottery ticket. First prize is 15 million Lebanese pounds -LRB- $ 30,000 -RRB-, `` enough money to get out of this damned country.'' Most of the 1.3 million Beirutis _ 90 percent of the city's population _ who fled the fighting are settling back in their homes and students are returning to school The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> reopened on Monday.

 The death toll from last week's nursing home fire rose to 11 on Monday with the deaths of two more elderly residents who had suffered smoke inhalation. Meanwhile, investigators said the four-story building's automatic alarm system malfunctioned when the fire broke out Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> and Convalescent Center Nine residents were killed and 98 of the 161 residents were injured.

Authorities said the fire was started when an elderly man who was smoking in violation of regulations accidentally tossed a match onto a mattress. The nursing home, built in 1969, did not have a sprinkler system. <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> Fire Marshal <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said investigators determined Monday that the building's automatic alarm system did n't work properly.

<HEAD>Democrats Fear Child Care Could be Victim of Capital Gains Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats fear that billions of dollars in proposed child care tax subsidies for low-income families could be lost in the fight over a proposed capital gains tax cut for the wealthy. The proposed child care tax writeoffs for families earning less than $ 25,000 are part of a broad deficit reduction bill that, in its House version, includes a cut in the capital gains tax rate for the rich. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version also includes the new child care benefits. But Senate Democrats and Republicans are haggling over how to also provide a similar break for better-off taxpayers. The chamber's leaders from both parties planned to resume talks today on resolving the stalemate after making weak stabs at it through the weekend. Republicans and a handful of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats want to fulfill President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promise last year to cut the tax on capital gains _ profits made from selling stock, real estate and other property. Democrats are countering with a proposal to encourage savings by middle-and upper-income families by providing a tax break of up to $ 330 if they save $ 2,000 a year in Individual Retirement Accounts. Looming over the negotiations is an Oct. 16 deadline. Unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completes work on a deficit-reduction plan by then, automatic across-the-board reductions will be triggered in most federal spending programs. `` We do n't have an agreement yet but everybody in there today thought we should get one,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> told reporters on Sunday. `` Child care legislation is of the highest priority in this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ a far higher priority than a capital gains tax cut,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. `` We do n't want that to fall between the cracks. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders are searching for a way to strip away from the big deficit-reduction bill numerous provisions that are popular with lawmakers but do nothing to reduce the deficit. Democrats are trying to cut the capital gains tax cut from the deficit-reduction bill. But the child care provisions then could come under the same knife. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have approved slightly different child care measures that would rely on $ 11 billion to $ 13.5 billion in Earned Income Tax Credits for low-income families over the next five years to provide more than two-thirds of the new benefits. Republicans generally favor the tax-credit approach. But the plans approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also include, at Democrats' insistence, $ 1.75 billion in new direct subsidies for child care plus a doubling of the current Head Start program for pre-school children Even if <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders are successful in stripping away the extraneous provisions and wrapping them together in a new bill, they still must seek agreement on the measure with their House counterparts. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has passed its own deficit-reduction bill. In addition to a capital gains cut, it includes repeal of catastrophic health coverage for retirees, restoration of the Fairness Doctrine that requires broadcasters to air all sides of an issue and extension of several expiring tax breaks for a variety of interests. Unless the House-passed deficit plan also is pared back, senators could be at a heavy disadvantage when they negotiate with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members on final details of the bill.

<TEXT>
 The army major who led the unsuccessful coup against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was buried Monday and opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> ended a 19-day hunger strike. Several reports have said an enraged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> personally shot Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, 38, to death minutes after the coup attempt against the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader ended a week ago. Relatives of <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> said he was shot once in the neck and twice in the chest. His mother, <PERSON> Eloisa </PERSON>, cried `` They murdered him!'' and flung herself on the coffin. The major led an uprising Oct. 3 and captured <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who commands the Panamanian military and controls the government, but gave up when loyalists counterattacked while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops looked on from a few hundred yards away. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> said eight officers and two sergeants were killed. They have not explained the circumstances or responded to reports that some were slain after surrendering. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldo </PERSON> on Monday said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> met with his general staff to begin reshuffling military units that hesitated during the uprising or openly opposed him. The spokesman also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters tried to intercept forces loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> flying into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, but wavered, apparently because they had not been given specific orders. `` They tried to dissuade the <ORGANIZATION> Machos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- the company that now guards <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headquarters -RRB- but there was no decision to say ` you can not pass,''' he said. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldo </PERSON> did not describe what action the helicopters In another development, the civilian Cabinet met with President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to approve emergency laws first proposed by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> last week and aimed at stifling military and political dissent. They include a military code, reforms to the penal code, labor laws to make it easier to fire disloyal public employees and economic laws to encourage investment. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> meanwhile ended his fast and entered a clinic to `` normalize my body's system.'' A medical bulletin said his `` conscious process was excellent and his conversationcoherent,'' but he was suffering `` from progressive debilitation.'' The opposition leader has urged Panamanians to delay paying taxes and utility bills, and to shun the government lottery and casinos, on which the government has depended for much of its revenue the past 18 months. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has applied economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> since federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> in February 1988 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims all efforts to oust him are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to retain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> after 1999, when it is to be turned over under treaties signed in 1977. At a news conference, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said he felt his hunger strike was a success. He said the opposition did not approve of the coup because it represented `` Noriegaism without <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' not a movement toward democracy. Capt. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejada </PERSON>, another rebel, was buried at the same small red stone church over the weekend. `` He had one bullet wound in the right temple,'' said <PERSON> Tejada </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Esther </PERSON>, who was at the church again for <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>'s burial. About 100 people attended the funeral Mass for <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>. `` They were good friends,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Tejada </PERSON> said. `` My son had just come back from -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty in -RRB- <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> last Saturday. On Tuesday he told his wife he had to go to headquarters and would return later to go see his baby girl. `` We did not hear anything until Wednesday when they said on television that he was dead. We picked up the body.'' <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>'s widow and three children did not attend. They have been under <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> protection at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> since the coup. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has flown about 40 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> coup participants, family members or <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> opponents to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, including Mrs. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, her two sons, her father and other family members. The group included 14 military personnel, according to the paper, which quoted unidentified <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration sources. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> officials say the rebels surrendered after nearly five hours of negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who was their hostage at Defense Forces headquarters. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers have said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> personally shot <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> in the final moments of the doomed uprising. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, the opposition's presidential candidate in May, took refuge in the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION>'s embassy after soldiers beat him and threw him out of his office Thursday. Shortly before the assault, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claimed he had evidence the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> planned to install <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> as president. Foreign observers said <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s ticket won the May 7 election by a 3-1 margin, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had the results annulled May 10. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said they consider <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> the legitimate president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Roach Revisionism Not Taking Hold at Agriculture Department</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Department scientists are still out to bash cockroaches when they can, regardless of some who say live and let live. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says there's a school of thought that suggests scientists `` ought to let up on the repulsive insects'' and concentrate on other pests. Defenders of cockroaches contend that unlike blood-feeding arthropods such as mosquitoes, ticks and fleas, the cockroaches `` are only incidental disease transmitters,'' says <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggen </PERSON>, associate editor of the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> magazine. `` Thus, the roach revisionists argue, the risks that attend cockroach control may outweigh the benefits to be gained by maintaining a roach-free home,'' she said. But scientists at the department's Imported Fire Ant and <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, remain skeptical _ and they've been studying roaches since the 1940s. <PERSON> Wiggen </PERSON>, writing in the current issue of the magazine, admitted cockroaches `` have never been irrefutably incriminated in the natural transmission'' of disease organisms to humans. `` But there's plenty of circumstantial evidence to tie the roach to cases of typhoid fever and other diseases caused by Salmonella bacteria,'' <PERSON> Wiggen </PERSON> said. `` They've also been implicated as carriers of Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and polio.'' <PERSON> Wiggen </PERSON> added: `` Roaches are notorious scavengers. They eat contaminated food and waste, then carry microorganisms in their digestive tracts, releasing them on the surfaces they contact. Release occurs through vomiting, excreting wastes and laying eggs on human food.'' A female cockroach can produce tens of thousands of offspring a year. In one study by the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency, scientists checking low-income housing in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> turned up 20,000 cockroaches in each apartment. There is also an esthetic dimension to the matter of food cleanliness, <PERSON> Wiggen </PERSON> said, quoting <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> who described `` roaches crawling out of the drain, across the counter and onto the cream pie.'' Entomologist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> of the agency's <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> research center said in a related article that some 4,000 species of cockroaches are known to scientists. Only about 50 species are considered pests, but those are enough to prompt Americans to spend an estimated $ 1.5 billion annually on pesticides to control cockroaches. A goal of the <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> research is to find long-term solutions, so <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> is using electronic sensor and computers to help study cockroach behavior. Cockroaches thrive in areas of stagnant air and high humidity. Anything else `` tends to dry them out,'' he said. Also, a cockroach behaves differently in a group than it does when alone. Some cockroaches prefer attics, while others, such as the German cockroach, primarily inhabit walls. Once scientists determine the conditions cockroaches need to thrive, <PERSON> Brenner </PERSON> said it may be possible to manipulate the environment around the home to repel them. `` The bottom line is safer, more effective means of controlling cockroaches and ultimately preventing infestations,'' he said. Meanwhile, cardboard `` hotels,'' liquid doses of chemicals, spray and other weapons continue to be used by homeowners. A new slow-acting insecticide, sulfuramid, was developed by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> scientists to use against fire ants and was also found to be 90 percent effective against household ants and roaches. Sulfuramid was used as a wetting agent to coat baits with a potential insecticide for fire ants, says retired entomologist <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lofgren </PERSON>. `` When the ants were killed not only by the test bait but also by an non-toxic control bait coated only with the wetting agent, we realized we had stumbled onto a new class of compounds for controlling them,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> recently approved sulfuramid _ which is sold by <ORGANIZATION> Griffin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Valdosta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, under an exclusive license from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ for use against household ants and roaches.

<HEAD>Former Employee Says Rockwell Ignored Warning on Plutonium Danger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former engineer at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons factory contends the plant operator knew for several years of possible accumulations of radioactive plutonium in the ventilation system but failed to investigate. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a utility design engineer at the site near <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> from 1980 to 1986, said in a telephone interview Monday that the operator, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, ignored the repeated warnings he voiced as early as 1984. `` They just said, forget it, we're not going to do it,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. Stone had no firm evidence of plutonium accumulations in air ducts, but his suspicions were proven correct by a team of independent investigators who last Friday told the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> they found 11 pounds of plutonium in air ducts linked to `` gloveboxes,'' or work chambers, in which plutonium is manually processed. The presence of plutonium in the ducts is considered a hazard because, under certain circumstances, it could lead to an uncontrolled nuclear reaction. Such a reaction could, in extreme cases, release lethal amounts of radioactivity. The investigators said the plutonium they found did not present an immediate health danger because it was not being released to the environment. But they criticized <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> for not having investigated earlier on the basis of <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>'s reports. Rocky Flats is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and makes plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> had contended prior to the investigation by experts from <ORGANIZATION> Scientech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an engineering and management company based in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, that there were no accumulations of plutonium in any ductwork at Rocky Flats. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heintz </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Monday he could not comment on Stone's allegations because they might be linked to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation of possible violations of environmental laws at Rocky Flats. He said the company was not prepared to comment on the Scientech findings because it had not studied the final report, which is highly critical of <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s safety procedures. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began investigating Rocky Flats last June but no indictments have been handed down so far. The independent investigators were sent to the weapons plant in July by Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, who is attempting to resolve uncertainties about operational safety and waste management at Rocky Flats and other weapons plants. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said he realized the probability of plutonium deposits in the ventilation system in 1984 while he was helping plan a renovation of Building 881, a former site of uranium and plutonium processing that now is used as a laboratory and computer center. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> did not act on his advice that the hundreds of feet of stainless steel ducts be sandblasted or cleaned in some other way to remove any plutonium buildup. `` It was n't part of the original scope of their work so they were n't going to do it,'' he said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>, a vice president of Scientech and leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> investigation, said in a telephone interview that <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> shut down several of the gloveboxes after the discovery in August and began taking steps to correct the problem. <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON> said `` it's still an open question'' as to whether plutonium deposits have accumulated in the ductwork at Building 881, where Stone had been working. Stone contended in an August 1986 lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> that he had been fired five months earlier in retaliation for having raised numerous health and safety issues, including the risk posed by the plutonium deposits. Stone's lawyer, <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, said the suit is scheduled to go to trial later this month.

<HEAD>HUD Audit Details $35 Million Spending Spree in One Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal housing officials say they're honoring most loan commitments they made in a $ 35 million spending spree in a multi-family loan program on the last day of fiscal 1988. More than 100 loans from the Section 312 loan program were approved that day _ Sept. 30, 1988 _ in an apparent rush to spend the money before it was transferred to another program at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, according to agency records and auditors. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> auditors determined most of the loans were approved despite incomplete applications and processing, but were told by the department's attorneys the government must keep its funding promises in all but a few cases. `` Where commitments were made they were honored, but -LRB- HUD -RRB- will not be making conditional commitments in the future,'' department spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. The Section 312 program has not received new funding for several years but continues to make loans using payments on outstanding loans. Roughly $ 200 million was available for the program in fiscal 1988. In the final month of the budget year, Section 312 loans totaling more than $ 40 million were approved, including 107 totaling $ 35.3 million on Sept. 30, according to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records. Seven of the loans later were canceled, including the largest, a $ 6.1 million loan to convert a closed hotel in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to apartments. There is nothing in the documents to suggest political favoritism was involved in the year-end loan approvals, but the auditors and other <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials said intense competition within <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for the shrinking federal housing allowance likely was a factor in the hasty approvals. The auditors also raised questions about program management, saying regulations requiring proper documentation and other checks before making loan commitments were ignored. Those criticisms mirror others levied at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> by auditors and congressional investigators who blame lax agency management for many of the problems being exposed in congressional hearings and internal reviews. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general reviewed 19 of the biggest loans made in the final month of the 1988 fiscal year _ those for more than $ 500,000 _ and found 11 were approved on the final day. In all 19 cases, the obligations, totaling $ 29 million, were improper because the necessary approval requirements had not been met, the auditors concluded last month. The auditors attributed the rush to spend the money to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' decision that any Section 312 money not spent at the end of the fiscal year was to be transferred to the Community Development Block Grant Program That program falls under a different <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> department and provides loans and grants to projects designed to benefit low - and moderate-income citizens `` We believe that most of the obligations were recorded because the ... staff wanted to obligate the available Section 312 funds before they were reallocated to the Community Development Block Grant Program,'' the auditors concluded in a report late last month. Several <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials interviewed in recent weeks said conditional approvals for Section 312 loans had been a common practice for years, with officials committing money to the projects before developers completed their applications. But such approvals will no longer be given because of the concerns raised by the inspector general and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s legal counsel, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> loan was canceled because a regional <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official who granted the project waivers did n't have the authority to do so, according to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records. The six other canceled loans totaled $ 5.1 million.

 An electrical fire broke out in an elevator shaft on the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forrestal </ORGANIZATION> on Monday night, and four sailors suffered minor injuries putting it out, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` At this moment we believe the fire to be out,'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> said at 12:15 a.m. Tuesday. `` I believe it took place in one of the forward elevators, just forward of the ship's superstructure. Two people suffered cuts and bruises and two suffered smoke inhalation. All four were treated at the naval station's dispensary, <PERSON> Byers </PERSON> said The fire erupted just after after 8:30 p.m. aboard the ship docked at <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. The fire was primarily confined to a machinery room inside the shaft of an elevator that raises aircraft to deck level, said Cmdr. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. There was `` quite a bit of smoke,'' he said. He could n't say where or when the ship was to be deployed next. At full capacity, the ship carries 148 officers and 2,810 enlisted men, plus 2,480 officers and men in the air wing, for a total of 5,438. The air wing was not on board Monday, leaving a crew of about 2,500 to 3,000 sailors on the ship, a spokesman said. The 1,086 foot-long <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON>, which is based at <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, was the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier launched after World War II and the first designed to operate jet aircraft. Now the third oldest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier on active service, the <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON> has been modernized several times since it was launched on Dec. 11, 1954.

 Neither bees nor rocks nor fast-drying cement could stop county officials from placing a marker at the state's geographic center. About 40 people attended a ceremony Saturday to install a brass <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey marker at a spot four miles up the <LOCATION> Devil </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trail </LOCATION> south of Cashmere But the siting was no simple matter. On the day before, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Warby </PERSON>, Cashmere centennial chairman, and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> pushed a wheelbarrow carrying a portable generator toward the site. The generator was to power a drill, which would make a hole for the anchor spike. But a sharp rock flattened one of the wheelbarrow tires, and as the two stashed the generator in the brush they set it down on a nest of bees. They left hurriedly. On Saturday, they retrieved the generator after spraying the bees with insecticide. Their hard luck persisted, though, at the site. Someone mixed up fast-acting cement for anchoring the plaque sooner than expected and officials had to work fast to get the marker in place. There was no time for speeches. `` We just said, ` This is the center of the state as near as anybody can tell,''' <PERSON> Warby </PERSON> said.

 The price of a ticket to Trinity Repertory Theater's production of `` Summerfolk'' tonight should spark precurtain murmurs. That's because theatergoers are paying what they want. `` The objective is to give everyone an opportunity to come to the theater,'' said <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Langan </PERSON>, managing director of the theater company that has won many national honors. The normal ticket price is $ 24. Based on similar experiments by others in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Langan </PERSON> said he expected people tonight to pay $ 3 or $ 4. `` But that's OK,'' he said. `` The whole purpose of this is for someone to be comfortable in coming to the theater.'' Patrons can offer a price as low as they want; the only rule is they must pay something, he said. <PERSON> Langan </PERSON> wo n't turn down offers of more than $ 24. `` I'd love to see that,'' he said. `` There is a great pressure to produce quality shows, and then the discussion gets into money and then there's pressure on ticket prices.'' Trinity has set aside $ 5,000 from a sponsorship grant from <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trust </LOCATION> bank to cover projected losses.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was unsure about becoming a doctor, and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> wrote his thesis on <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, not DNA. But today the pair share the Nobel Prize in medicine. The two microbiology researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> celebrated their award on Monday, by toasting each other with French champagne at a news conference at the university. Then they headed to Candlestick Park to watch the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> win the National League playoff series against the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>. The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Karolinska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest and oldest medical university, cited <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> for their discovery of a collection of normal genes that can cause cancer when they go awry. In 1976, their research showed that normal genes that apparently control cell growth can undergo alterations that lead to the uncontrolled growth that is cancer. Their work has led to the discovery of more than 40 different genes that can cause cancer, and is leading to better ways to diagnose cancer and predict who is at risk. As knowledge of the genes increases, researchers hope to find ways to block them if they become deranged, stopping the growth of the cancerous cells. The research helped scientists understand how cancer begins, and it `` widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which govern the normal growth of cells,'' the assembly said. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> called the research by him and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> a `` cornerstone in understanding the genetic mosaic of cancer.'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> were optimistic about the practical applications of their work. But they were cautious about forecasting a cancer cure. `` This is just another step in what's a long journey,'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said. `` It's very difficult to predict when a full view of the cancer cell will be at hand.'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> saluted other researchers in the field, saying, `` We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us.'' But Dr. <PERSON> Dominique </PERSON> <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> researcher who carried out experiments overseen by <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> in the 1970s, said bitterly Monday that he was disappointed about not being included in the Nobel Prize. `` This work belongs to me,'' he said, `` and I do n't know why the scientific community refuses to attribute the discovery to me.'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> and <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> called <PERSON> Stehelin </PERSON>'s work `` crucial'' to their research, but referred questions about the prize to the Nobel committee. `` We did n't nominate each other,'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said he abandoned plans to become an English professor, and his studies of 17th century literature, to attend medical school after learning that writer <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> enrolled at <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> after being told that `` medicine opens all doors.'' Gradually he found that he enjoyed being in the laboratory more than the clinic, and his research career began. `` My mother died of breast cancer, but I do n't know if that in itself caused me to study the cause of cancer ... there's hardly anybody in this room who is not touched by cancer somehow,'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> said he was interested in science in high school, and decided to become a doctor. But he said that `` by the time I finished college, I was n't so sure I wanted to be a doctor.'' It was a rural <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> doctor, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kough </PERSON>, who became his mentor and convinced him that his calling was in medical research. <PERSON> Kough </PERSON>, director emeritus of hemotology at <ORGANIZATION> Geisinger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>'s `` spark was recognized not only by me, but by his professors ... by everybody who came into contact with him.'' <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, holds degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Gettysburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Oceanside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, has degrees from <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Both said they do n't expect their lives to be dramatically altered because of winning the Nobel Prize. `` It's the only job I've ever had since putting on roofs in high school, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> quipped. `` I like my life the way it is, and I hope it stays that way,'' <PERSON> Varmus </PERSON> said. `` The danger is you're supposed to be smarter today than you were yesterday, and I'm not.''

<HEAD>Aging Communists Find New Scapegoat in Western News Media</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-East Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders have found a new scapegoat to explain away mounting protests for reform and the refugee exodus. The culprit is Western news media. Worldwide television broadcasts of police beating people protesting for democratic reform in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and elsewhere have pushed the Communist government to bitter denunciations. One party newspaper condemned the `` gang of Western reporters,'' while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s official news agency accused Western journalists of working in cooperation with the demonstrators. During protests, police roughed up journalists, smashed cameras, confiscated film and ordered some photographers and television crews to leave the East German capital immediately. They also detained at least two journalists before letting them go several hours later. Until recently, large street protests were a rarity in a country whose government traditionally blamed its woes on Western agents and an allegedly unfriendly government in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Television footage of unrest was scarce. But over the last month, that has changed. An exodus of at least 50,000 East Germans to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Sept. 11 emboldened those left behind to speak out and protest during a weekend visit by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> attracted dozens of Western correspondents and television crews anxious to know what he told <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s hard-line leader, <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, who has rejected the reforms embraced by some East bloc allies Consequently, the many foreign journalists accredited to cover <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit were on hand to hear the thousands of East Germans who want reform. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and five provincial cities, police over the weekend beat and arrested hundreds and perhaps thousands of protesters. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leaders were angered. The first broadside came on Sunday, after thousands of protesters filled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s main square. `` In the evening hours of Oct. 7, troublemakers tried to disturb the people's celebrations for the 40th anniverary of the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' the state news agency, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` In cooperation with Western news media, they banded together in the <ORGANIZATION> Alexanderplatz </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s main square -RRB- and nearby areas and called out slogans against the Republic.'' Among the slogans the protesters chanted was, `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, help us!'' The East German government tried to clamp down on reporting Sunday, declaring whole areas of the capital off-limits to photographers. That included a Lutheran church that has become the focal point for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s growing opposition movement. `` Wherever the gang of Western reporters went, especially the television crews, certain types showed up seconds later and started trouble,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> youth newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Junge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> charged. But, as if to balance hostility to the Western news media, the newspaper also said that its own photographer's camera had been smashed in the weekend clashes. The nation's official newspapers printed Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> dispatch calling the pro-democracy demonstrators `` troublemakers.'' <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lodged an official protest against the East German interference with the Western journalists, but the East German government's diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> rejected the allegations. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television network also lodged a protest, saying the East Germans' interference with its reporters' work violated `` international rules and regulations,'' including the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords.

<TEXT>
 For many residents of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, the resort island raked by Hurricane Hugo and then plundered by looters, life is still chaotic. Three weeks after one of the century's most destructive storms struck the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> on its way to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, most of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croix </ORGANIZATION>'s 56,000 inhabitants still have no electricity or telephone service. Running water is just beginning to be restored. Thousands of houses, schools and churches are destroyed, and some beaches are fouled by sewage and fuel oil. Health officials have raised concerns about the possibility of epidemics caused by contaminated water, a lack of refrigeration, poor sanitation and millions of mosquitoes breeding in stagnant water. A tent hospital in <LOCATION> Christiansted </LOCATION> is the only one on the island admitting patients. The looting has long since stopped, but 1,000 military police deployed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to help restore order still patrol the streets with pistols and M-16 rifles. A curfew remains in effect. Scores of supermarkets and hardware, appliance and clothing stores stand in ruins, their shelves emptied by looters. `` We do n't have anything to eat. We do n't have any stores to go to,'' said <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, a mother of seven children ranging in age from 10 months to 20 years, as she stood in a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> food line in the eastern port town of <LOCATION> Frederiksted </LOCATION>. `` We need rice. We need corn flour,'' she said. `` I try not to get depressed. I just have to think things are going to get better.'' <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, about 70 miles east of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, was by far the hardest hit of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, although St. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> also suffered substantial damage when Hurricane Hugo hit on Sept. 17. Three people were killed on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, where winds of up to 216 mph stripped the once lush landscape of its foliage. From the air, towns on the 84-square-mile island look as if they were bombed. Dr. <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Frederiksted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said he and 13 other doctors have treated nearly 5,000 patients for storm-related injuries such as nail punctures, broken bones and burns. <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> said he was beginning to see patients with psychological problems caused by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s devastation. A typical case, he said, was a man depressed over the loss of rare vases collected over a lifetime. `` The thought of having something to leave as a legacy is not there anymore,'' <PERSON> Hodgson </PERSON> said. The territorial government has estimated damage to the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> at $ 500 million, but Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said he expected the figure to rise to $ 4 billion. Damage to the giant <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> refinery in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> alone was $ 100 million, he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has alloted $ 1.1 billion for hurricane relief in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said he believed it would take up to two years for <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> to recover fully from the hurricane. `` This is going to be a long one,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, who is directing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s relief operation in the territory. `` I think we'll be in the full-steam-ahead recovery program for six months. We may still be building some houses after that.'' Federal officials say 6,300 houses in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION>, about one-third of all homes, were heavily damaged or destroyed. <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> said most of the homeless were staying with relatives but that 500 remained in shelters. Tap water started flowing to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Croix </LOCATION> homes on Thursday, but was being rationed while repairs continued. Officials said it would take at least six months to fully restore electricity and telephones. There is extensive damage to hotels, guesthouses, restaurants and marinas, and the outlook for tourism is bleak. However, nine of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Croix </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 hotels say they hope to reopen by the start of the winter tourist season in December. Meantime, hundreds of workers have been laid off and there is concern some businesses might never reopen. Some businesses said they were ruined by looters, who went on a four-day spree and stole everything from food and building supplies to lawn mowers and TVs. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents are searching homes for stolen goods, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office is investigating allegations that members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the local police force were involved.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Strait </PERSON>, a former ranch trail boss whose songs are White House favorites, was voted entertainer of the year by the <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Strait, 37, won country music's top honor Monday night during the association's nationally televised 23rd annual awards show. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON> won top vocalist honors, and perennial honoree <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> received two awards. The accolade for <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> came a month after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a country music fan, told the singer how much he enjoyed his songs. The president made the comments during a Rose Garden ceremony honoring <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> and 11 others for promoting vocational-technical education. Monday night at the Grand Ole Opry House, <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>'s peers gave him a standing ovation as he accepted a bullet-shaped trophy for entertainer of the year. `` I'm so excited. I've wanted this for so long,'' said Strait of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He thanked his Ace in the Hole Band, adding: `` I truly believe audiences go away entertained.'' Strait's July hit single, `` What's Going On in Your World,'' was his 19th No. 1 song in eight years of recording. His album `` Beyond the Blue Neon'' has been a top seller this year. Besides his crisp tenor, he is known for his spiffy cowboy hats, neatly pressed jeans and starched shirts that accent his lean, athletic frame. `` This is incredible,'' he said backstage after the awards program. `` I'm my own worst critic. I know I'm not a great singer.'' A fourth-generation cattle rancher who was a trail boss in the 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> Strait </ORGANIZATION> has a degree in agriculture from <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Top male vocalist honors went to <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, an ex-pipefitter in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, for his recent hit singles `` From a Jack to a King'' and `` Hole in My Pocket.'' `` I thank God he gave me a voice instead of big feet,'' <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> quipped as he accepted the award. Top female vocalist <PERSON> Mattea </PERSON>, a former tour guide at the Country Music Hall of Fame, had a No. 1 single in `` Come From the Heart.'' `` I've always liked to do this -LRB- sing -RRB-, because I liked the doing of it,'' she said, her voice choked with emotion. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the association's entertainer of the year in 1987 and 1988, was the night's only double winner. Both awards were for his music video, `` There's a Tear in My Beer'' _ on which old footage and sound recordings are used to make it appear that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> is singing with his late father, the famed country artist. The vocal event of the year award goes to two performers who do n't normally sing together. The late <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON>, 33, who died of an accidental alcohol overdose in May, won single of the year for his hit `` I'm No Stranger to the Rain.'' The award was accepted by his widow, singer <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who said as her voice cracked, `` Five months ago on this date, I lost the world's greatest husband, and country music, in my eyes, lost the world's greatest singer.'' The mother-daughter team the <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION> won duo of the year, making it the fifth consecutive year they won either duo of the year or group of the year. `` I think as time goes by, we appreciate it -LRB- winning -RRB- more every day,'' daughter <PERSON> Wynonna </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> said. `` Music is n't just a living, it's our life.'' Singer <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> and music publishers <PERSON> Cliffie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapp </PERSON> were chosen for the Country Music Hall of Fame. Other winners included: `` Will the Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II'' by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, top album; Highway 101, group of the year for the second straight year; fiddler <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimble </PERSON>, musician of the year; `` Chiseled in Stone'' by <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Gosdin </PERSON>, song of the year, a songwriters' award; and <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, Horizon Award for a rising star.

 An obscure chapter of World War II history is emerging from beneath the frigid, gem-clear waters off the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, where divers made a high-tech survey of Japanese wrecks. A Japanese submarine, six other vessels and what may be the hulk of an American B-17 bomber were painstakingly charted by divers who braved 35-degree waters off <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> islands last month. The relics were measured and filmed so the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> can preserve the story of the bloody battle to drive the Japanese from the only American soil held by foreign soldiers since the War of 1812. From Sept. 5 to Sept. 22, a team of about 30 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> divers working in 20-minute shifts off the USS Safeguard explored the sandy bottom of <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. They found the 243-foot submarine resting in 80 feet of water, said park service archaeologist <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>. `` It looked like it sustained direct bomb damage,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. `` The conning tower was blown off and was sitting in the water nearby. Other than the conning tower damage, it was in good shape.'' The desolate, windswept islands, which lie in the nearly uninhabited chain that stretches west from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, presented imperial <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with a potential base for bombing runs on the airplane plants of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, a 12-hour flight to the southeast. Japanese soldiers took <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION> in June 1942, building roads and even a fire-fighting water system that remain intact. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces stormed <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> on May 11, 1943, retaking the island in a 19-day bloodbath which left 549 dead. It took three months to root out the last of the Japanese on the treeless island. Only 28 of the 2,650 Japanese defenders were captured; the rest were killed or committed suicide. On <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION>, 200 miles to the southeast, Japanese forces carrying only personal gear and rifles slipped off the island in bad weather on July 28. Unaware, allied forces bombarded <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION> and came ashore Aug. 15. Despite the lack of an enemy garrison, the invasion force sustained more than 300 casualties _ with most falling to booby traps or shootouts between nervous troops. The park service already protects the islands' surface as a historical preserve. Now, the wrecks beneath the island's waters will be nominated for protection under federal historic landmark laws, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. The survey team aboard the Safeguard started by probing the bottom of <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> by sonar and marking each wreck with a buoy. Then, a 1-by-2-foot remote-controlled submersible with a video camera was sent down to inspect with sonar contacts. If the find was worth inspecting, divers made detailed, measured drawings. The team brought plans for ships it expected to encounter, and as the drawings were brought to the surface, they were entered into a computer, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. `` We had up-to-the-minute computer-generated measured drawings,'' she said. While the divers worked, other members of the team started an inventory of the rich Japanese and American military historical sites on the island itself. Some structures had collapsed, others were obscured by more than 40 years of vegetation. `` A lot of the Japanese roads still are in good shape. There are miles and miles and miles of communication lines, both American and Japanese,'' <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. The Japanese abandoned more than 50 structures including Shinto shrines, 6-inch coastal guns, 25mm and 75mm antiaircraft weapons and piles of other equipment. The diving team planned to work off both <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION>, but days of 50-knot winds and 25-foot seas at <LOCATION> Attu </LOCATION> delayed that part of the survey until at least next year, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said. And more work is needed at <LOCATION> Kiska </LOCATION>, where more submarines and destroyers are known to have been sunk. The project's charts will be available to the public, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said, and a commercial-grade video should be available in the spring.

 A prison parolee with a history of sexual assaults pleaded guilty to kidnapping an 11-year-old girl and told authorities he accidentally ran over her with his car and buried her in a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> forest. The prosecutor who negotiated the plea bargain Monday said he hoped eventually to file murder charges against <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON>, who agreed to help investigators find the body of <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Maciulis </PERSON>, missing for two years. `` I just totally ca n't believe he accidentally ran her over with his car,'' said <LOCATION> Marinette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Duket </PERSON>. `` The prosecution reserves the right to charge him with first-degree or second-degree murder ... if in fact he takes us to the body and through scientific or forensic evidence it can be proven the death was not of an accidental nature.'' <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON>'s plea in <ORGANIZATION> Marinette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is the latest twist in a bizarre story of a prison correspondence that brought the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> sex offender to live with a <LOCATION> Marinette </LOCATION> woman and her teen-age daughter. <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON>, 43, had been living with the woman in the same apartment complex as <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'s family for about three weeks when he and the girl disappeared July 10, 1987. Prosecutors maintained that <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> kidnapped <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> intending to assault her. The defendant said he left town before dawn that morning and was driving south on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 41 when he discovered the girl in the back seat of his car. He said <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> asked him to take her to her father's home near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but, worried because of his criminal record, he made her get out of the car. While driving away, he said, he accidentally hit her. Then, he says, he put her body in a duffel bag, drove south and eventually buried her in some woods outside <LOCATION> Dalton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The prosecutor, who labeled the story `` incredible,'' originally charged <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> with kidnapping and enticing a minor for immoral purposes in <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'s disappearance. He also was charged with attempted second-degree sexual assault on his girlfriend's 16-year-old daughter The latter two counts were dropped in the plea bargain, which calls for <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> to serve 25 years in prison on the kidnapping charge. If the body is n't found, <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> has agreed to plead guilty to extortion in an unrelated case and serve a additional six years. Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> accepted the agreement but delayed sentencing until after the search for the body. Authorities said <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicklaus </PERSON>, assented to the terms of the agreement. According to the prosecutor, <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> has at least four sex-related convictions. Paroled after serving about seven years of a 30-year term in one of the cases, <PERSON> Blassingame </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> in mid-June 1987 because of a romance with <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON>'s neighbor, his prison pen pal, <PERSON> Duket </PERSON> said. They struck up a correspondence through a pen-pal advertisement in a magazine, he said. The relationship soon soured, <PERSON> Duket </PERSON> said, noting that the couple's prison correspondence would have been used as evidence if the case had gone to trial. The prisoner asked for pictures of his pen pal's daughter in a swimsuit. <PERSON> Duket </PERSON> recalled the contents of the prisoner's letters, saying: `` He wanted -LRB- the woman -RRB- to adopt a girl between 7 and 11 ... He asks whether -LRB- the woman's daughter -RRB- is a virgin or not, because he's going to be her father, after all ... ``

 Delegates who dissolved the country's ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ended a four-day congress today after voting to keep their old leader but picking a reform slate to fill other top posts A closed session chose <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, chairman of the dissolved party, late Monday as president of its successor, the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which professes to now embrace constitutional democracy. The vote followed debate in which key reformers opposed to some of Nyers beliefs _ including his support for continued party influence in the workplace _ reluctantly shelved reservations to avoid a possible split. Reformers want a clear break with the past and that includes depoliticizing the workplace, where under traditional one-party in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc the leaders of party cells organized in the workplace have been de facto bosses. The congress also elected a 25-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to replace the Communist Party Politburo. Among its members are key reformers <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, who belonged to the old party's collective leadership. But the two were not chosen as vice presidents to <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, an indication that most of the 1,200 delegates were unwilling to completely part with the past. The new party's statutes had foreseen two vice presidents and liberals proposed <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>. However, the clearly reformist makeup of the <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the party's executive body _ was expected to please some liberals unhappy with the choice of <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>. Despite the party's commitment to multiparty democracy, reformist delegates expressed fear that the it does not differ enough from its predecessor to attract much support among the people. The choice of <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> was likely to increase anxieties among leading reformers that their party will fare poorly in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s first free national elections in 41 years, which have been promised by June In its last two hours after midnight the congress approved the following resolutions _ all falling short of the wishes of the most committed reformers among the delegates: _ Start of discussions in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about the fate of party-controlled assets accrued illegally during its predecessor's 41 years in power _ Informal support of the largely volunteer Worker's <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, formerly controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and facing dissolution, if it decides to give up its paramilitary character and become an emergency aid organization during fires, floods and other catastrophes. _ Declaration of Oct. 23, the start of the 1956 nationalist uprising that was crushed by Soviet tanks, as a `` Day of National Reconciliation.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, tired but clearly elated, told reporters that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been the first to congratulate him. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> conducts very fast diplomacy,'' he said. `` They gave me his telegram within two hours of my election.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> list contained names of reformers only, including some former Politburo members such as Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON>. Missing were the names of other, less reform-minded Politburo members. Politburo member <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, the most conservative of the old party's collective leadership, was among those not elected to the new body. But he had said previously that he would not seek a senior post. The new leaders were elected just hours after the party adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break with a past that advocated the Leninst dictatorship of the proletariat. Delegates overwhelmingly approved striving for `` a constitutional state based on a multiparty system, where the source of power is the will of the people expressed in free elections.'' The party changed its name in a vote on Saturday. Before Monday night's secret vote for its new leaders, there were serious ideological rifts among the three top candidates in the collective leadership. But <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, said earlier to be siding with <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> against <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, told reporters going into the congress hall for the vote that `` the danger of a split has been averted.'' <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, criticized by some reformers for not being a strong advocate of barring old-style Communists from the new party, repeated that there would be no purge. `` We will part from certain people, but it should be a friendly parting,'' he told reporters after his election. The congress has rejected radical reformers' demands that die-hard Marxists be barred from the new party, stipulating instead that all accepting its orientation in writing could become members. Reformers were further embittered Sunday when <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> declared that he backed continued political organizing in the workplace _ which <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> opposes. The congress subsequently voted for the motion to continue organizing at factories and in offices, despite reformist protests.

<HEAD>Study: Top `Family Values' Don't Include Abortion, School Prayer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE LOCKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Politicians who claim to fight on behalf of `` family values'' in battling abortion and promoting prayer in school may be off target, according to a study released today. `` Politicians and pundits of various stripes have attempted to co-opt the term -LRB- family values -RRB- in pursuit of their own agendas,'' said the study on the American family, which included information from 1,200 randomly selected respondents. The survey was commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The respondents were presented with 28 value statements and asked how well the term `` family value'' described each one. Topping the list of responses were love and emotional support for family members, respect for others and taking responsibility for one's actions. `` Being in favor of prayer in school'' ranked 25th and `` opposing abortion'' ranked 27th. `` It tells us that our legislators really do n't know what they're doing,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Salk </PERSON>, who was hired by Springfield-based <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> to review the study findings. `` They're all paying lip service to something they've not really examined.'' <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> said a true political `` family value'' might be granting paternity leave or employers giving time off for parents to attend school functions. The study said Americans are changing the way they define family, but family is still the center of their lives. By 3-to-1, Americans defined the family as `` a group of people who love and care for each other,'' over the traditional definitions of people related by blood or marriage. Eighty-one percent of the respondents listed `` family'' as one of their top two sources of pleasure, with `` friends'' the next most mentioned source. `` People cherish the family and they cherish it because of their own experience even when their experience has been less than perfect,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Solnit </PERSON> of the Child Study Center at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, one of the advisers to the study. `` Even with the rate of divorce and even with the rate of remarriage the expectation of being able to love someone and being able to be cared for by someone is universal,'' <PERSON> Solnit </PERSON> said. While family was a top source of pleasure to Americans, it also was a chief source of worry, the survey found. Fifty-one percent said providing financial security for their families was one of the things they worry about most. Americans also believe that the root cause of social problems is found in the family, with the largest group, 20 percent, blaming the problems on `` parents failing to discipline their children.'' But the question of whether the American family is actually in decline drew a paradoxical response that <PERSON> Salk </PERSON> described as, `` I'm OK, but everybody else out there is not. More than half of respondents gave a negative rating to the quality of American family life. But 71 percent said they were at least `` very satisfied'' with their own family life. The survey said that might mean respondents were n't willing to speak honestly about their own problems, or that the declining American family is a myth fueled by widespread media reports of crime and social ills. The survey was part of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION>'s `` American Family Values Program,'' initiated in 1988 to get a better understanding of the family, their basic market, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Dion </PERSON>. The program included discussions with family experts, an analysis of media issues, discussion with four focus groups of families in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and a random telephone survey conducted in June. The margin of error for the sample was less than 3.5 percent.

 By the time firefighters arrived at the schoolhouse, flames were shooting from the windows. The blaze, one of hundreds started each year by juveniles in the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> area, was the creation of 13-year-old <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON>. The seventh-grader had gone to the school for shelter from the rain. Once inside, he flicked his cigarette lighter until it ignited books. Now, five months after counseling and participation in a nationally recognized <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> program called Cease Fire, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> says he's glad he was caught. `` I tell other kids not to do things like that,'' he says. `` I can do better than what I had been doing. I tell them not to do the bad stuff. I learned the bad stuff the hard way.'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> and about 1,500 other juveniles, ranging in age from 10 to 16, and their parents have gone through the program, the brainchild of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Fire Marshal <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Corral </PERSON>. The program `` puts out more fires than a fire truck,'' said Corral, a 32-year fire department veteran and marshal since 1981. Cease Fire is marking its eighth anniversary this week in conjunction with National Fire Prevention Week. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> cited the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> program as one of the nation's most successful and innovative juvenile fire prevention pilot programs. The majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arson crimes are committed by children, who cause more than $ 11 billion in damage per year, Corral said. He said about 50 percent of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s arson fires were set by youths at the time of the program's inception; now he estimates that juvenile arson amounts to about 10 percent of all arson crimes. Cease Fire also has held 12-week courses at various neighborhood community centers. Upon graduation, each young person is given a badge and acts as a junior fire marshal in neighborhoods. Thousands have attended the classes, he said. Now, however, <ORGANIZATION> Corral </ORGANIZATION> said he is scrambling for funds. The program's counseling service had been supported by $ 100,000 in federal grants, but no federal funding will be available in the next year. He said he will seek private funds and continue parts of the program. Researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, have applied for a grant to study the case histories of the 1,500 juvenile arsonists who have been through Cease Fire, <ORGANIZATION> Corral </ORGANIZATION> said. He hopes the study will renew interest in his program. `` Our highest priority is to get our message to kids early enough so they refrain from experimenting or playing with fire,'' Corral said. `` Prevention is the key to fire protection.''

 A moderate earthquake with a preliminary reading of 4.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale jolted <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, causing downtown buildings to sway. There were no immediate reports of damage. The quake, which registered 3 on the Japanese scale of 7 in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, struck at 3:28 p.m. and also measured 3 in neighboring <LOCATION> Yokohama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> cities, and 2 in other outlying areas adjacent to the Japanese capital.

He said <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s attacks have been insensitive to women and an effort to gain politically from a highly emotional issue.

The girl's long-range prognosis is excellent, he said, adding that he has felt all along that she could live a normal life. `` I feel even more convinced now than before, since we now have had an actual opportunity to see her liver,'' <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said doctors are satisfied that the enlarged spleen was the cause of internal bleeding, which had hospitalized the youngster three times in the past month. The spleen was seven or eight times the normal size, he said, or about the size of a melon. A normal spleen for a youngster that age is about the size of a lemon, he said. <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> performed <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s liver transplant at the same hospital when she was 11 months old. That operation followed her family's nationally televised pleas for a liver donor Their efforts ultimately led to the National Transplant Act of 1984, which created a national computer system used to match donors with recipients. <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said Monday's spleen-removal surgery left the youngster without a `` very important'' source of fighting infection. Because of that, he said, she was given a vaccination to guard against pneumonia-type illnesses and will have to take daily penicillin tablets the rest of her life. `` Hopefully, she'll do well and be out of here in a week's time,'' he said `` It's hard to predict.'' <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> has survived longer than any of the 200 other liver transplant patients at the university since 1968, <PERSON> Najarian </PERSON> said. She was born Nov. 26, 1981, with biliary atresia, a condition in which the liver's bile ducts are blocked. Months later, the Fiskes learned that only a liver transplant could save her life. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, said after the operation that he and his wife, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON>, were looking forward to tickling <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>'s toes when the anesthesia wore off. The Fiskes live in <LOCATION> Bridgewater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` She's as healthy as she can be considering the fact that she was dying back in 1982,'' he said.

 Four divers experimenting in long-term underwater survival have plunged into a 74-day mission to test breathing compounds that might eventually be used in orbiting space stations, researchers say. The divers, who submerged on Monday, will live in a capsule simulating dives up to 980 feet deep until Dec. 21 in the operation directed by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> navy and the <ORGANIZATION> Maritime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expertise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, or Comex, of <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> said. A team of 24 scientists will gauge the reaction of the divers to a hydrogen-oxygen breathing compound researchers hope will allow people to stay under water longer and at greater depth than the traditional hydrogen, oxygen and helium. They are also testing a helium-oxygen blend, though the hydrogen-oxygen blend is the focus of the experiment. The $ 3.13 million experiment, dubbed `` Hydra-IX,'' also will measure the physical and psychological effects of long submersion, <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> said. The results could help submarines reach lower depths and, eventually, aid in the development of manned space stations, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. The divers, whose identities were not disclosed, will work seven hours, 30 minutes daily and communicate by telephone with their families once a week. They will also receive televised newscasts. The experiment calls for the men, aged 28 to 33, to spend the first three days at 33 feet under water on a mixture of helium and oxygen. They will then be lowered to 230 feet and be fed a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, which will be raised in pressure over eight days until simulating a depth of nearly 1,000 feet. After 20 days, helium will be introduced and hydrogen phased out until the divers are breathing a helium-oxygen compound.

<TEXT>
 People gather at a fruit stand, speaking in low voices. They are talking about a newspaper photo of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The picture was taken Wednesday, the day after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> survived a coup attempt. He stands at a window at Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters, waving to a crowd. Behind the general is an image _ not a person _ and they ca n't make it out Some Panamanians do not rule out supernatural intervention on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s behalf. It is said the general has a Haitian spiritual advisor, that he worships African gods. Clearly they are powerful, for he has put down two coup attempts in 18 months and fended off the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which wants him out of office. Many rumors roam the streets of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, where people fear the general so much they are afraid to let it show. On Oct. 3, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was captured and held for five hours by rebels. But he survived, retained his post as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and his grip on power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Now it is said the general will stop at nothing and Panamanians fear nothing will stop him. `` Blows for the undecided,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said two days after the uprising. `` Lead for the enemy and silver for the friend.'' Officially, ten rebels died in the uprising, eight of them officers. But there are rumors of trucks loaded with the corpses of fallen mutineers. Some reports say <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> personally shot the leader of last week's abortive coup. `` You are a dead man,'' he is supposed to have told Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, who withered and dropped his gun. A list is being made of the disloyal, the government employees who do not enthusiastically support the general. `` The list, the list, the list,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said when he announced the purge. `` Names, names.'' On the day of the coup attempt, people thought the military strongman had fallen. They waved handkerchiefs or honked horns to celebrate, while some danced in the streets. A few church bells rang. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> did n't fall. And now he's taking down names. Two days after the coup attempt <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s gunmen dispersed a crowd around opposition leader <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>'s office and sent him running with blows. `` I did not hear anything. It is not good for me to hear anything,'' said a street vendor plying his trade a few yards away. A homeowner lets in a stranger who wants to borrow a telephone. When he realizes the stranger is a journalist, his finger comes down on the button to cut off the call in mid-conversation. `` No politics here,'' he says. Some taxi drivers wo n't pick up journalists. It would be bad for business to be seen with a reporter who may want to go to unsafe places such as the cemetery where <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> was buried Monday. One fallen rebel was refused burial in his family parish. The priest, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chaplain, had a choice between God and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He chose the general. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has taken on God before. His troops tear-gassed churches when dissent was still public. People avoided Mass the Sunday after the coup. Just in case. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>'s widow did not attend his burial Monday. She and her threee children were hidden at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military base, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> after the coup. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today they and 36 others were flown to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> over the weekend. `` They murdered him,'' <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>'s mother cried, throwing herself on the casket. She said he had been shot once in the head and twice in the chest. A wreath of red carnations lay at the foot of the altar. `` From your old friends,'' it said. No names. The opposition, which once rallied tens of thousands in streets and won the May 7 elections <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> later annulled, sat out the uprising. `` We'd just have been supplying the bodies,'' <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said later. `` The truth is, we are all afraid,'' another opposition leader said. Even the unkind nickname <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> earned because of his pockmarked skin _ <ORGANIZATION> Pineapple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Face </ORGANIZATION> _ has taken on new meaning. The pineapple, people say, is the toughest of tropical fruits. It does n't fall. It has spines. Panamanians made their feelings about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> clear in May balloting. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also insists he has to go. `` You'll have to kill me first,'' he said, facing the mutineers. He has made that perfectly clear. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the rebels were n't prepared to take that step. Nor were they prepared to hand <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to face <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking indictments.

 Hurricane Hugo put a lot of people out of work temporarily, but should n't cause long-term damage to the economy, the mayor said. Also Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops arrived to help cart away mountains of debris and smashed appliances and furniture left in the storm's wake Unemployment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> jumped from 4.5 percent to more than 16 percent after the hurricane, which struck Sept. 21 at <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and killed 25 people in the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>, which hit <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and several <LOCATION> Carribean </LOCATION> islands before reaching the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland, did an estimated $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion damage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and $ 725 million in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, which bore the brunt of the storm, unemployment is estimated at 10 percent, Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said Monday. He predicted that the economic forces fueling the city's most prosperous period in 100 years would help the economy recover quickly. `` Our goal is to have our tourism economy back to full steam as quickly as possible so that jobs that have been lost can be replaced,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. Growth will continue, he predicted, as thousands migrate to the area to retire or work in the beach resorts. `` <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> was booming more than it had in 100 years and the reasons for that boom have not changed,'' the mayor said. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> suggested that unemployed youths be given federal job training so they can help rebuild the region. `` The silver lining in the cloud is the chance to train and retrain people,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Monday in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>. `` Let's train our youths to do the work.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he met last week with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and she was receptive to the proposal. About 250 engineers and soldiers from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stewart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, were expected to hit the streets today in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> counties to help clean up. They brought 13 front-end loaders and 40 dump trucks. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said he hoped much of the debris could be cleared in two weeks, although <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials were n't as optimistic. `` We could have people cleaning up for the next six months,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, district engineer for the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. The Army will remain in the state for another week while the corps arranges with private contractors to complete the work. Streets throughout the region known as the Lowcountry are littered with piles of leaves, broken limbs and logs from felled trees _ some piled so high they obscure the view of the houses beyond. Refrigerators and other appliances are piled up along the streets in low-lying areas and islands that flooded during the storm. No one knows how much debris may be strewn along streets and highways, but <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said 1,000 truck loads a day are moved out of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> alone. The federal government agreed last week to pick up the tab for the entire cost of removing the debris. That will save the state and local governments as much as $ 50 million, <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said.

 A jury convicted a man of planting 13 bombs around a southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> city in a plot that prosecutors said stemmed from a lifelong rivalry with a state legislator. `` I know I'm innocent; God knows I'm innocent,'' a Bible-carrying <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters as marshals led him from the courthouse. The jury deliberated just over three hours Monday before returning guilty verdicts on 29 counts in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court. Family members who sat in the courtroom, including <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON>, began to cry as the verdict was read <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> also wiped away tears. `` We love you and still believe in you,'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Opal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, told him as he was being led away. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> turned to her and said, `` Let the world know.'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, 32, and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 42, were arrested May 17 and charged in connection with the 13 bombs that were found July 5, 1988, beneath bridges and behind buildings in the city of <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, who worked with <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> at a <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> factory, was convicted on all counts following a trial last month. The charges against <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> included conspiracy, illegal possession of dynamite, 14 counts of making bombs and 13 counts of attempting to destroy bridges and buildings used in interstate commerce. Prosecutors contended <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> was motivated to place the bombs around <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> because of his lifelong rivalry with state Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a Democrat from <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>. `` He resented him for a lifetime of accomplishments that he thought <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Newkirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> had that Mr. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> did n't,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said during closing arguments.

The attorney said he felt the government had not proved its case against <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> beyond a reasonable doubt. He told jurors the government's case was `` riddled with mistakes'' and based on circumstantial evidence. <PERSON> Watts </PERSON> said he was uncertain whether the case would be appealed. Judge <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> set no date for sentencing. <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, who has been in custody since his arrest in May, faces up to 285 years in prison.

 <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Louden </PERSON> thought a tree had crashed into the roof of her home when she felt a rumble that shook her `` right down to the fillings in my teeth.'' `` Boy, was I wrong,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Louden </PERSON> said Monday as she pointed to a 500-pound limestone boulder lobbed through her roof by a construction-site blast. The stone lodged in the floor of a bedroom shared by Mrs. <PERSON> Louden </PERSON>'s sons, ages 8 and 10. The boys were n't in the room, and nobody was hurt.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Passes First Strike Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the first time in the Soviet history, lawmakers have voted into place a legal framework that gives workers the right to strike. But the complex measure passed by the Supreme Soviet legislature on Monday also bans strikes in almost a dozen strategic sectors of the economy. Only 12 of the chamber's more than 400 deputies voted against the bill, with 10 members abstaining, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The Supreme Soviet reconvened today to consider price stabilization measures, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Inflation has only recently been acknowledged to be a problem in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The need for a labor law became urgent this summer when hundreds of thousands of coal miners went on strike for better working conditions and political reform. The law was also needed to curb the now commonplace stoppages provoked by ethnic conflict. Thousands of Russian workers in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> walked off the job recently to protest laws they viewed as disciminatory. Although strikes were not expressly forbidden by Soviet law, the few stoppages that occurred before President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power were brutally suppressed. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has not moved to crush labor unrest but has warned that widespread strikes threaten to undermine his efforts to overhaul the economy to make it more market-oriented and encourage greater democracy in politics. He backed the right-to-strike law, which prohibits strikes that `` create a threat to people's lives and health.'' It also bans stoppages by workers in railroads, public transportation, civil aviation, communications, energy, defense, government bodies, law enforcement and round-the-clock production industries, the agency said. In addition, the law forbids politically or ethnically motivated strikes, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Only with all other options exhausted does the union have the right to strike. To launch a legal strike, a union must first give a `` conciliatory commission'' comprising representatives of both labor and management five days to resolve the dispute. If that fails, arbitration has seven days to work things out before the union may call a walkout. Lawmakers of the Supreme Soviet, which was a mere rubber stamp for decisions of the Communist leadership until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms gave it real power, contested many of the law's provisions Monday and voted on some 50 proposed amendments. Human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> suggested that some form of political strike be considered legal, but his proposal was defeated, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Several deputies complained that too many sectors of the economy were prohibited from striking. Under the new law, those sectors can appeal to the Supreme Soviet with their complaints. The law follows an emergency measure passed by the Supreme Soviet on Oct. 3 banning strikes until the general law could be passed. The coal strikes over the summer paralyzed much of the crucial coal industry and ended only after the government conceded to virtually all the miners' demands. The miners had sought more consumer goods and more local control over their industries. Although he expressed sympathy for the miners, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said repeatedly that such strikes could lead to anarchy and economic disaster.

<HEAD>Thatcher's Tories Hold Conference Amid Fears Of Currency Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BLACKPOOL, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opened its annual four-day conference today amid fears of a currency crisis and with its popularity at an eight-year low Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told party members at a pre-conference dinner in the northwest seaside resort of <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION> late Monday: `` The economy is stronger than ever. Living standards are higher than ever.'' But newspaper headlines today spoke of crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> wrote, `` <ORGANIZATION> Tories </ORGANIZATION> gather in <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION> as shares and sterling slump,'' referring to the British currency. The Independent read, `` Fears of crisis as pound plunges. Sterling collapse triggers sharp fall in share prices.'' The Financial Times, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s leading business daily, said, `` Substantial selling on fears that interest rates will not be raised further.'' The pound was down early today by 1 cent, and 4 cents lower than it was before <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> raised the British equivalent of the prime rate by 1 point to 15 percent on Thursday. `` The interest rate rise was necessary and this government always does what is necessary and always has,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who attended Monday night's dinner with <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> ordered the increase following interest rate increases in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and five other European countries. It was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 11th rise since the rate stood at 7.5 percent in June 1988 The pound fell heavily on foreign exchange markets following weekend reports that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> were at odds over the interest rate increases, designed to support the currency and hold down inflation. But <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> insisted in an interview Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that there was no split in Cabinet ranks. Higher interest rates make the British currency more attractive to foreign investors and curb inflation by making credit more expensive for consumers. But business leaders have warned that high rates could send the economy into recession. The latest interest rate increase has pushed up the cost of monthly mortgage payments for home-buyers, adding to the growing unpopularity of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government. New opinion polls show the Conservatives 7 to 11 points behind Labor. They suggest voters are increasingly disenchanted with 63-year-old Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and many are opposed to almost all her latest programs. Particularly unpopular, the polls show, is legislation to sell off the water and electricity utilities to private enterprise, a new property tax, and a shakeup of the free <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. They are cornerstones of the third five-year term Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> won in June 1987. The economy, meanwhile, has taken a turn for the worse. The trade deficit hit a record $ 3.61 billion in August and inflation has risen to an annual rate of 7.3 percent. The conference follows a highly successful opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gathering last week. Labor adopted a new, more centrist, platform and ditched its policy of unilateral nuclear disarmament, which cost the party votes in the last election. The conservatives, who have trailed Labor for four months in the opinion polls, are falling further behind in their most consistent slump since a 1981 recession. Police marksmen scanned the <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION> seafront from the roof of the conference hotel. Tight security has surrounded Conservative conferences since the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> blew up Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s hotel in <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, during the 1984 party convention, killing five people

 A malfunctioning alarm system slowed firefighters' response to a nursing home blaze, the fire marshal said, as the death toll from the fire rose to 11 from nine. The alarm at the <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> and Convalescent Center should have been automatically relayed to the fire department, Fire Marshal <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said Monday. But because of a blown fuse in a control box, the alarm was n't relayed through <ORGANIZATION> MGI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> when the fire broke out Thursday night, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said `` The alarm never left the building,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said after investigators checked <ORGANIZATION> MGI </ORGANIZATION>'s records. Had the system worked properly, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said, firefighters would have been gotten to the scene earlier. The blaze was reported by four calls to the 911 emergency number. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said the response time after the calls was four minutes. Two of the 105 people hospitalized after the blaze died Monday of complications of smoke inhalation, authorities said. <PERSON> Ettie </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, 88, died at <LOCATION> Sentara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miley </PERSON> said; <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansthorn </PERSON>, 97, died at <ORGANIZATION> DePaul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, according to hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. Five people remained in critical condition, authorities said. Seven of <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION>'s 161 residents died inside the home during the fire, and two more were pronounced dead on arrival at area hospitals. The fire is believed to have started when a patient, smoking in his room against regulations, accidentally dropped a match on his bed. Most of the injuries were from smoke inhalation.

 Ghosts and goblins are n't scary enough for one police chief who plans to unleash a nightmare on his community this Halloween _ a haunted `` crack house.'' Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lechliter </PERSON>'s Halloween attraction will combine a fake drug market, courtroom, emergency ward, prison and morgue to show children and adults what happens to those who sell or use cocaine and other drugs. `` We're talking about real life here,'' said <PERSON> Lechliter </PERSON>, head of an eight-man police force in a town of 2,000. `` They -LRB- children -RRB- may go to bed with nightmares. I want to have an impact.'' The haunted house will be in the former county jail, a century-old three-story stone building. Volunteers will act out brief scenes showing a drug sale, an arrest, a trial, and a drug user's accidental overdose. The performers will strive for accuracy to let `` kids know about what it's like to be on drugs,'' he said. About two dozen people, including county sheriff's deputies and paramedics, will help run the free attraction for four nights around Halloween. Local merchants are financing the effort. `` It's not a bad notion,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sause </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Queen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge who has signed up to play himself in the courtroom scenes. `` The more people get involved, the more we'll get out of it.'' The haunted crack house may be the first crack house of any kind for the rural eastern <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> community. <PERSON> Lechliter </PERSON> said he has made only one arrest involving crack _ a highly addictive form of cocaine _ since he took over as chief last January. While there may not be a big crack problem, `` there are drugs in this town, no doubt about it,'' the police chief said. `` I do n't imagine we're much different in that respect than any other town in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has tightened border security in an apparent effort to prevent people from fleeing to this British colony during a dispute over repatriation of illegal immigrants, police said today. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> refused for the first time Sunday to take back 70 people who immigrated illegally to the territory. The move came in apparent retaliation for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s allowing a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> swimmer who had sought political asylum in the colony to leave for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. No illegal immigrants have been returned since. A <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> spokesman said discussions to resolve the deadlock have proceeded through normal diplomatic channels, but refused to elaborate. The territory's government has routinely sent back all illegal immigrants from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1980. The sudden refusal by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> to accept them has brought anxiety to capitalist <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that police believe <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has stepped up patrols along the border to prevent people from escaping after its June military crackdown on the student-led pro-democracy movement. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown caused concern among <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents for their own freedoms after 1997. Government radio quoted unnamed police sources as saying <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> border patrols appeared to have doubled in strength. They were also more heavily armed than usual, police said. It was not immediately clear what effect the added <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> security would have. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> police reported 49 illegal immigrants were caught in the 24-hour period that ended at 5 a.m. today, a total that a police spokeswoman described as `` normal.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> Governor Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> urged the resumption of normal arrangements for repatriation of illegal immigrants as soon as possible. `` It's much better if -LRB- we can -RRB- get back to normal handling of matters on the border, because that is the way to make sure that confidence is maintained in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' he told reporters. More than 12,000 illegal immigrants have been repatriated to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> so far this year.

The cause of the fire was undetermined, Ms. <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> said. She said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was notified but had n't indicated whether it would investigate. She said the blaze was confined to a part of the plant separated by concrete walls from the reactor. `` There was no threat to the public other than just like any electrical fire that may occur at any facility,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeill </PERSON>, another CP & amp; L spokesman. Because of damage to equipment, the 900-megawatt plant was closed for a refueling outage that had n't been scheduled to begin until next week, the company said.

<HEAD>U.N. Cuts Food Rations to Cambodian Refugees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> cut its food rations to the largest <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> refugee camp because some of its aid had been diverted to guerrillas fighting inside <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, relief sources said today. The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the food aid to the Site 2 camp inside the Thai border had been decreased by nearly 20 percent following disclosures that refugees were selling or otherwise diverting the food to the military. Site 2 houses more than 180,000 followers of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, one of three major guerrilla groups fighting the Vietnam-backed government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> The front recently launched an offensive against the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> army from its bases along the Thai-Cambodian border and claimed to have scored major successes. A spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Border Relief Operation, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>, said that regular rations to the residents of Site 2 had not been reduced. `` But -LRB- the agency -RRB- has, however, regretfully decided to suspend further delivery of administration workers' rations and some of the social rations pending clarification of their use,'' he said. Administraion rations are given to Cambodians at the camp who help distribute food to the general population or otherwise help with administration of the camp. Social rations are special food supplies given to certain well-identified groups such as single-parent families. Relief officials note that diversion of food, medicine and other humanitarian aid provided by aid agencies to the refugees has been going on since the program began a decade ago. Some said officials have privately been especially critical of the aid being supplied the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who exercise rigid control over the civilians under their control. Human rights organizations have cited numerous human rights abuses at the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> camps where monitoring of international aid is far more difficult than in camps run by the other two factions in the three-member guerrilla coalition. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 and says it withdrew the last of its troops last month.

 Baton-wielding police today charged thousands of protesters who threw rocks and fired slingshots to demand freedom for political prisoners on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s National Day. Officials said five policemen were treated in hospitals for injuries and one protester was slightly injured. As the government held its own parade and rally nearby, the demonstrators clashed with about 2,000 police clad in riot gear and backed by water cannons and barbed-wire barricades. The clashes failed to disrupt the parade and rally, which were held to mark the 1911 uprising that led to the fall of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s last dynasty, the Qing. An estimated 250,000 spectators were on hand. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> briefly addressed the rally, which was attended by dignitaries from 40 countries. The demonstrators, waving flag poles and sticks, tried to break through human walls formed by police. Riot police with shields and truncheons charged them, but the protesters quickly regrouped to confront the officers again. Television footage showed a man in a yellow shirt running close to the police line and lobbing a large rock into their midst. The police charged the man and he fell. Another shot showed blood staining the back of a protester as he was helped away by a friend. In the afternoon, about 2,000 riot police blocked all three intersections leading to the jail where dissident publisher <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON> is being held. About 10,000 protesters, wearing yellow headbands, waved banners that read `` Release <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>, 48, was jailed in the <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Tucheng </LOCATION> after he returned to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in a fishing boat last month. He was wanted by the government for his alleged role in organizing a 1979 anti-government demonstration in which hundreds were injured. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> and four other executives from the <ORGANIZATION> Formosa </ORGANIZATION> magazine were charged with trying to topple the Nationalist government by organizing the demonstration. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> left for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shortly before the 1979 riot. The other four men were convicted of sedition and released after serving part of their lengthy jail terms. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan-chen </PERSON>, the organizer of today's protest, said the demonstrators wanted to appeal to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to release political prisoners. The detainees include <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> and two other prisoners who were convicted of sedition and sentenced to lengthy jail terms in 1987. All three were accused of advocating that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> no longer consider itself part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ an act the Nationalists consider seditious.

 A man whose visiting 8-year-old granddaughter shot herself in the thumb with a gun found in his room has been arrested under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s new law against leaving weapons within reach of a child, police said. Sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 60, is believed to be the first person charged under the law, which went into effect Oct. 1. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s granddaughter, <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, discovered the loaded, unlocked .32 - caliber automatic in a box on the floor of his bedroom Sunday, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> The shot she fired passed through her thumb, a bedroom door, a bookcase and onto the floor of the living room, where several family members were gathered, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. The child was treated at a hospital and released. `` It could have killed her or the others,'' said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Also Sunday, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, 12, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> was fatally shot in the abdomen when a 9-year-old playmate pulled the trigger on a rifle he thought was unloaded, police said. The boy had taken the rifle from a rack, police said. The names of the 9-year-old and his parents were withheld pending a decision on whether to prosecute, state attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. He said he wants to know how the gun was secured before making a decision. The gun law was passed during a special legislative session last summer after several children were shot, some fatally, by youngsters playing with guns. The law requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions, such as using a trigger lock or keeping the weapon in a locked box. Under the law, if a child shoots someone because of a gun owner's carelessness, the adult can get up to five years in prison.

 Sailors on the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forrestal </ORGANIZATION> worked today to cool hot spots from an electrical fire in an elevator machinery room. Nine sailors suffered minor injuries, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. The fire broke out about 8:30 p.m. Monday and was believed to be mostly confined to the room, which contains machinery for an elevator that raises aircraft to deck level. Cmdr. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said it could have traveled along cables to other areas of the ship. `` Electrical fires can be deceiving. We wo n't know the scope until they trace the cableways and find the source,'' he said. Fire crews from the naval station, east of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and other ships stood by to assist, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. But the flames were fought by the ship's crew. Nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation and cuts and bruises putting the blaze out, he said. They were treated at the base dispensary. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> did n't know early today whether the fire would disrupt the ship's schedule. He said he could n't release information about future ship deployment. At capacity, the <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON> carries a crew of 5,438, including officers and crewmen on the air wing. The air wing was not aboard Monday, leaving 2,500 to 3,000 sailors on the ship, a spokesman said. Based at <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION>, the 1,086-foot <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON> was the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft carrier designed for jets. Now the third-oldest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carrier in active service, the ship has been modernized several times since it was launched in 1954. It was renovated in 1983-85 at the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> to extend its life 15 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s worst carrier flight deck disaster since World War II occurred on the <PERSON> Forrestal </PERSON> off <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1967 when a fire killed 134 crew members and injured 64. The fire was ignited by a missile accidentally fired by a plane that was being armed on deck.

 Banned playwright and human rights campaigner <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> made a surprise appearance in the official media when the Communist daily Rude Pravo unwittingly published his photo. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, using a pseudonym and apparently outfoxing editors, paid a $ 50 fee and sent his picture for publication in weekend editions, congratulating himself in the personals column on his 53rd birthday. It was the first time that <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, banned from publishing at home, had his picture printed in an official Czechoslovak newspaper since the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that put down the `` Prague Spring'' reforms of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>. `` On Oct. 5, 1989 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanek </PERSON> of <PERSON> Maly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hradek </PERSON> celebrated his birthday,'' read the caption accompanying <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s photo in Saturday's paper <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanek </PERSON> is the name <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> used for autobiographical characters in some of his plays. <PERSON> Maly </PERSON> <PERSON> Hradek </PERSON> is <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s country residence, north of <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. `` His friends and colleagues thank him for the hard work he has done and is still doing in his life, send many greetings and wish him success in his work,'' the daily said. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was a candidate for the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, which last week was awarded to the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, the Tibetan spiritual leader. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was most recently arrested for his political activities in January.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has invited the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in the next two weeks to seek a formula for Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, officials said today. The Israeli officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> presented a proposal to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON>. They did not elaborate on the substance of the proposal. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invitation came after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 12-member inner <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> rejected a proposal by the center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to accept an Egyptian call for talks with a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The plan was defeated by the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. The Palestinians criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, saying it had blocked the peace process. The Israeli officials said details of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan were discussed in a series of telephone calls since last Friday and followed up with a written proposal relayed by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Speaking Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet The Press,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> indicated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was actively involved in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. `` We're not involved by getting on an airplane and flying over to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, but the suggestion that we're not involved, I'm sorry, is simply not accurate,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Asked if he was personally involved in deciding who would represent the Palestinians in peace talks, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said: `` Let me simply say that we have sent such a message ... It's been sent to both capitals.'' He said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was `` working with language to try and bridge the gap between Israelis on the one hand and Palestinians on the other.'' The makeup of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation has been a major problem. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> objects to the particpation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it views as a terror group. Initial reaction to the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposal was positive from both Labor and the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>. But Likud officials indicated more study was needed before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan or even the call for a three-way meeting. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, a senior aide to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, confirmed that a three-way meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was one idea under consideration. But he declined to give details. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who plans a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in mid-November, said in an interview published in the liberal daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> that he welcomed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the peace process. But he also reflected the fears of his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could be pushed into an indirect dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal calls for a meeting within two weeks by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Israeli and Egyptian officials to discuss the makeup of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation and an agenda for the proposed <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> talks. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> hawks, who plan a meeting Wednesday, opposed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s plan outright, saying a meeting with Palestinians in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> was a ruse to start negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Labor's minister of energy, <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON>, said in an interview that his party would accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal. He also said the rejection of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal could lead <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> to break up the coalition government.

<TEXT>
 A three-eyed alien and a robot landed in the Russian city of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, zapped a boy with a tube and made him disappear, a Soviet daily reported today, quoting supposed witnesses. The newspaper, following up on an earlier report by the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, assured skeptics that `` something did in fact happen.'' The purported landing of a UFO in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> is the latest bizarre tale to appear in the state-run Soviet media under the policy of `` glasnost,'' or openness. The media recently have told of other sightings of unidentified flying objects and space invaders. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, not known for its sense of humor, informed the world Monday that scientists had confirmed that an alien spaceship carrying giant people with tiny heads had touched down in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, a city of more than 800,000 people about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. As many as three aliens left the spacecraft, described as a large shining ball or disc, and went for a stroll in the park, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. A <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> duty officer later contacted by telephone stood by the story. `` It is not April Fool's today,'' he said. <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kultura </PERSON> was the only major national daily to print anything today about the supposed UFO, indicating that more prestigious papers such as Pravda may have wanted nothing to do with such a topic. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION> said its coverage was motivated by `` the golden rule of journalism: the reader must know everything.'' `` Of course, it's hard to believe in what happened in the town,'' it said in its report from <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>. `` It's even more difficult to explain.'' The daily, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, quoted witnesses as saying the aliens landed on a warm evening on Sept 27. At 6:30 p.m., it said, boys playing soccer saw a pink glow in the sky, then spotted a deep red ball about 10 yards in diameter. The ball circled the park, disappeared, then reappeared a few minutes later to hover over the park, it said. The paper said a crowd rushed to the site, and people clearly saw a hatch open in the lower part of the sphere. Through the opening, it said, people could see a three-eyed alien about 10 feet high, clad in silvery overalls and bronze-colored boots and wearing a disk on his chest. <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kultura </PERSON>, quoting witnesses, then gave this sequence of events: The UFO landed. Two creatures, one apparently a robot, exited the hatch. A boy started screaming with fear, but when the alien looked at him, with eyes shining, the boy fell silent, unable to move. The onlookers screamed, and the UFO and the creatures disappeared. About five minutes later, they reappeared. The alien had what appeared to be a gun _ a tube about 20 inches long. It pointed the tube at the 16-year-old boy, and the boy disappeared. The alien went inside the ball, which immediately took off. At the same time, the boy reappeared. He was not identified. <PERSON> Sovietskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Kultura </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> correspondent, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Efremov </PERSON>, gave obvious credence to the witness accounts. `` Children and eyewitnesses of the abnormal phenomenon have been questioned by police workers and journalists,'' he wrote. `` There are no discrepencies in the description of the sphere itself, or the actions of the ` aliens.' Moreover, all the children who became witnesses to this event are still afraid, even now.'' <PERSON> Efremov </PERSON> said scientists from the local branch of a nationwide group that investigates `` abnormal phenomena'' were probing the landing. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Voronezh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, threw doubt on the initial <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report that quoted him as saying the aliens left behind two pieces of rock that can not be found on earth. `` The rock they described as extraterrestrial is in fact a piece of -LRB- iron ore -RRB- which could easily have originated on earth,'' <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said there indeed was `` a landing site'' or something resembling one in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, but the symmetrical depressions also could result from the leak of an underground pipe or cable, an underground reservoir or another geological feature. `` Do n't believe all you hear from <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>,'' the spectroscopist advised. `` We never gave them part of what they published.'' Shortly thereafter, the phone connection was cut off.

<HEAD>Researcher: Pay Phone Calls Really Do Last Longer if You're Waiting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 If you think the person ahead of you is going to talk on the pay phone forever, you may be right _ and you may be the reason. A study by <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubak </PERSON>, a psychology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, suggests that people talk longer on pay phones if someone else is waiting. It's not just your imagination. `` Humans are just like animals; they defend their space. In public territory we place personal value on space, and when we are challenged, we defend it,'' <PERSON> Rubak </PERSON> said in today's <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution. He said most callers do n't stretch out their conversations simply to be annoying. Rather, the person waiting may distract the caller, thereby lengthening the phone call, he said. <PERSON> Rubak </PERSON> and his students used questionnaires and observed callers at pay phones at three hospitals, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hartsfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a train station in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, two shopping malls, a mass transit train station in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and two convenience stores in rural western <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The study showed calls in airports tend to be the shortest, partly because the pressures of departing flights overpower territorial tendencies.

Two weeks ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tranportation </ORGANIZATION> denied a <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> request to join the Adopt-a-Highway program, saying a <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION> sign could prompt more littering. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, state <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> director, on Monday said the state `` apparently agrees with Sen. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and with the government of communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in claiming that people have to pass some political litmus test in order to participate in government programs.'' `` If government is able to decide who gets to participate in a program based upon government approval of their views, government is doing a very Klan-like thing,'' <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> seizures of almost 36 tons of cocaine may be the result of the Colombian drug crackdown as traffickers move the drug out of an unsafe haven, officials say. But others say the timing of the huge busts may simply be coincidental. The drugs seized may have come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or may have been in this country before the crackdown began Aug. 18 in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, they say. `` We're seizing a lot more cocaine because a lot more cocaine's coming out, because it's not safe to leave it in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> anymore,'' Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told reporters at a dock in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where the ship Zedom Sea was taken after six tons of cocaine were seized from it in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> While drug traffickers used to send out cocaine in smaller lots as a security measure, they've now begun moving it out in huge shipments, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. `` That's because of the pressure from the government in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' he said. The Colombian crackdown, begun one day after the assassination of a leading presidential candidate who was a critic of the drug trade, has resulted in sweeping arrests and the seizure of millions of dollars of drug traffickers' assets. One accused money-launderer has been extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The traffickers vowed to wage `` total war'' against the government and have been blamed for 157 bombings that have killed 11 people and wounded 200. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in the past two weeks seized 20 tons of cocaine from a warehouse in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, nine tons from a house in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> five miles from the Mexican border, six tons from a ship in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and 1 -LCB- tons near <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The 20-ton seizure was the largest ever in the world, while the nine-ton bust is the second largest in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. `` These seizures certainly indicate the traffickers are taking substantial risks and they are moving vast quantities of their drugs out of the country for whatever reasons they have, but one of them must be their perception that it is not safe down there,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON>. `` They are taking substantial risks and we are taking advantage of that,'' he said. Several years ago, cocaine came into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> primarily on private aircraft. The shipments were much smaller and the loss of any load cost the traffickers much less. `` As we became more effective in targeting that method of transit, they have changed,'' <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said. `` These are businessmen ... We feel that they are weighing the risks and have decided they have got to move these drugs.'' But there also are reasons to believe that the huge busts may have nothing to do with the situation in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. For example, there is no indication how long the 20 tons of cocaine seized in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> had been in that warehouse. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said the group arrested in connection with that seizure had been operating the warehouse for two years. During that time, <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> said, authorities estimate 60 tons were processed through the warehouse in addition to the 20 tons just seized. In <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the home in <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> about five miles above the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> `` has n't been used very long as far as we can tell.'' But he added, `` We think this is the second large load intended to go out of the house. We missed one load.'' Although the house was purchased in September, the month after the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> crackdown began, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials `` do n't have any hard evidence'' the huge seizure resulted from Colombian drug traffickers pushing their wares out of their own country, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Since the standard method is to leapfrog it from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it could have been stockpiled in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for a time,'' he said. Officials still have not identified the owner of the house, he said. The cocaine itself obviously came from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, he said, noting that `` some of the dope was wrapped in newspapers from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 Ten bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and another city just hours after a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> official reportedly met with President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> for talks on fighting the drug war. The bombs injured 23 people and caused extensive damage, shattering a three-day lull in a terror campaign blamed on drug traffickers, police said. Earlier they had said 32 people were injured but then lowered the number of casualties. Also Monday, police shot and killed a suspected terrorist in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> as he tried to flee, presumably after setting a bomb, police said. No further details were provided. Three bombs exploded in downtown <PERSON> Pereira </PERSON>, capital of the Western province of <LOCATION> Risaralda </LOCATION>, and one of them injured 14 people in a lottery office, police said. They said two other bombs were deactivated in the city of 500,000 and a midnight-to-dawn curfew was imposed. Police earlier said four bombs had exploded in the city. In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, seven bombs exploded in supermarkets, residential neighborhoods, in the commercial center and at the base of electricity pylons, injuring nine people, police said. The explosions caused millions of dollars in damages, they said on condition of anonymity. As in previous attacks, no group claimed responsibility but the bombings were believed the work of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine barons. Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s southern command, arrived in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> Monday afternoon and met at the presidential palace with <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and the chief of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Administrative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maza </PERSON>, accoding to the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>. The Administrative Security Department, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s national detective force, has been in charge of trying to track down Colombian drug traffickers. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON>, usually well informed of government activities, said the general talked with <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maza </PERSON> about the government's war on drug traffickers. It said he was leaving <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> today. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Enbasst spokesman refused to comment on the general's visit <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> was leaving today for <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, where he will attend a meeting of a group of eight Latin American countries trying to find a peaceful solution to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s problems. The meeting of the so-called Group of Eight will deal with foreign debt, international coffee prices, trade and drug trafficking, <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s office said. The countries attending are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> will not send a delegate, <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s office said. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> will try to get <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> to join <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in a program of crop substitution to reduce crops of coca bushes. Coca bush leaves are used to make cocaine base. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> started a crop substitution program last year year in one state on a trial basis. The government has not said how successful the program has been. Since Aug. 23, 157 bombings and arson attacks have killed 11 people and injured 200. On that date, traffickers declared war on the government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> for its decision to reactivate an extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and expropriate property belonging to alleged cocaine smugglers. The government declared the emergency measures on Aug. 19, a day after the slaying of Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, the leading presidential contender. He had led a crusade against drugs in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine capital. Earlier Monday, authorities raided five cocaine laboratories along the <LOCATION> Rosario </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, arresting eight people and destroying a ton of coca leaves, the national radio chain <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> reported. Coca leaves are the raw product for cocaine. Police also reportedly seized weapons as well as coca seeds and chemicals used in processing cocaine, the radio said citing the commander of the state's anti-narcotics police. Since <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> began the crackdown, only one reputed top drug figure has been extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stand trial. Since 1981, about 50 judges and 170 judicial employees have been killed, allegedly on the orders of cocaine bosses.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to resolve a dispute over taped evidence in the federal prosecution of nine men accused of robbing $ 7.2 million from a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> six years ago. The justices said they will decide whether all the tape recordings made during court-authorized electronic surveillance of the defendants may be used as trial evidence. A federal appeals court ruled that some of the tapes may not be used as evidence because they were not sealed for safekeeping quickly enough. Prosecutors say members of an organization in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> known as <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>, or the machete wielders, were involved in the Sept. 12, 1983 robbery in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Nineteen members of the organization were indicted by a federal grand jury in connection with the crime Evidence linking nine of the men to the <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> robbery was discovered during an investigation of a rocket attack on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. During that investigation, court-authorized electronic snooping was conducted at six different locations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> between April 1984 and August 1985. After their indictment, the nine men sought to have all tape recordings obtained during the surveillance ruled inadmissible as trial evidence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, after an eight-month hearing, last year suppressed 378 tape recordings made at two of the six locations: one defendant's apartment in <LOCATION> Levittown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, and the home of two other defendants in <LOCATION> Vega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the suppression order last May 5, ruling that government agents waited too long after the taping sessions had ended to have the tapes sealed _ and preserved as evidence _ under a judge's directions. `` While we eschew any thought of automatic suppression on the basis of time alone, we do not believe that any satisfactory explanation has been offered for this long delay,'' the appeals court said. It found a 118-day delay in one instance and an 82-day delay in the other. In the appeal acted on today, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers argued that the tape recordings should not be suppressed because of delays in having them sealed if they are proved to be unaltered originals. The nine defendants involved in the case are <PERSON> Filiberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Diamante </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Farinacci </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Issac </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> <PERSON> Negron </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ivonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Melendez </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrion </PERSON>, <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dias </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON> <PERSON> Osorio </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Arizona Killer's Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to consider reinstating the death sentence of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> murderer <PERSON> Jimmie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>, convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> 13 years ago. The justices said they will review a ruling that, although upholding <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>' murder conviction, declared his death sentence unconstitutional. <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON> was convicted of the Oct. 20, 1976 killing of <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> in a <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> motel. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON> had been told that Ms. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> had provided police with information about his heroin trafficking. Trial testimony indicated that <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON> injected Ms. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> with a massive amount of heroin and then choked and beat her while she was unconscious because he was worried the overdose would not be fatal. A state judge sentenced <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON> to death after ruling that the murder was `` especially heinous and depraved.'' <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>' conviction and sentence was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and the nation's highest court refused to hear his appeal in 1983. <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON> then sought help from a federal judge, and subsequently appealed the judge's denial to the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. By a 2-1 vote in 1987, the appeals court struck down <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>' sentence while unanimously upholding his murder conviction The appeals court relied in part on a 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that limited the use of an `` outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman'' aggravating factor in sentencing. Such a factor may be applied only to cases in which victims were tortured before death, the high court said in 1980. The 9th Circuit court ruled that <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>' death sentence `` must be struck down as arbitrary'' because `` we are unable to find a principled means of distinguishing the depravity of <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>' conduct'' from that of some convicted <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> murderers who received life sentences In the appeal acted on today, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> prosecutors contended that the appeals court showed too little deference in setting aside a state court's finding of the `` especially heinous and depraved'' aggravating circumstance. The case is <PERSON> Ricketts </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Jeffers </PERSON>, 89-189.

 A strike by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s 57,800 Machinists went into a seventh day today with a pledge of economic support from about 25 other unions. The Machinists asked for help in case the strike at the world's biggest and busiest manufacturer of passenger jets runs long, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of Machinists Local 751 No contract talks were scheduled. None have been held since the Machinists, including 43,300 in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, rejected a three-year contract and walked out Oct. 4. The strike also affects plants in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and several other sites. The unions that voted support represent 125,000 workers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. Their leaders met Monday. `` This was a real upbeat meeting,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` People are willing to do whatever they can do monetarily. They're going to form a hardship fund, that type of thing.'' The support did not involve refusal to cross picket lines. All of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s unions have contracts that prohibit sympathy strikes. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the hardship fund would help strikers with mortgage payments and other bills. He said the other unions also promised to set up a temporary employment center. `` This is a classic labor dispute because the issues are clearly defined,'' <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON> said. `` Is the company going to use its economic leverage or are the employees going to use their economic leverage? That's what it's all supposed to be about.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials said they did not know how to interpret the show of union support. `` I still do n't think anybody at this point knows how long a strike it will be,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>. A company that advertised for aircraft maintenance workers was deluged by hundreds of job-seekers, including <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strikers. <ORGANIZATION> Intertec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> said its recruiter's visit to <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> on Sunday was planned before the strike. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has delivered two planes since the strike began, and hopes to deliver 92 more by the end of the year. Five consecutive years of record orders have given the company a backlog that stretches into the late 1990s. That backlog was behind Machinists' demand for better wages and lower mandatory overtime. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> offered a raise 4 percent, followed by 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991, and annual bonuses of 8 percent of gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990. Mandatory overtime would have been reduced from 200 hours per quarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula improved. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 356 million on sales of $ 9.07 billion for the first half of 1989 and had profits of $ 614 million on sales of $ 16.96 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Court Overturns Fine Against Pennsylvania Newspaper</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today overturned a fine against a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> newspaper for publishing conversations of a bookmaker whose telephone was tapped by police. The justices ordered a state court to reconsider a $ 1,000 fine and $ 17,409 in lawyers' fees imposed against The <ORGANIZATION> Easton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper carried a story based on wiretap transcripts accidentally placed in public court records. The high court said the case should be restudied in light of the justices' ruling last June that spared a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> newspaper from having to pay damages to a rape victim whose name it published. An Express article on April 7, 1982, related a conversation between bookmaker <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettger </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Forks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and a bettor on college football games who owed him money. The bettor permitted state police to tap his phone in return for protection. The wiretap transcripts were placed in a court clerk's file, and a reporter for the newspaper was permitted to see them and take notes on the conversations. <PERSON> Boettger </PERSON>, who pleaded no defense to bookmaking charges and was fined, sued the newspaper. He said it violated his privacy and a 1978 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law designed to protect people from unauthorized disclosure of information obtained through wiretaps. <PERSON> Boettger </PERSON> withdrew his privacy claim but was awarded the $ 1,000 plus legal fees by a state jury that decided the Express had violated the 1978 law. The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the jury award last March. It said the 1978 law permits police _ not news organizations or the general public _ to reveal wiretap information. `` There is no justification to allow the media a unique prerogative to trespass where the general populace is barred,'' the state court said. It said the privacy interests the 1978 law are intended to safeguard outweigh free-press rights. `` Only when the protected information is disseminated either through an order of court unsealing it or through its use as evidence in an open court proceeding does the media's interest rise above those of the -LRB- state -RRB- and its citizens,'' the state court said. The Express, with support from leading news organizations, said the state court ruling conflicts with the justices' ruling last June. In that ruling, the high court threw out a $ 97,500 award won by a rape victim whose name was published by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, a weekly newspaper in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. The victim's name was obtained from a report posted by mistake in a sheriff's department press room. The justices said then, `` We do not hold that truthful publication is automatically constitutionally protected. We hold only that where a newspaper publishes truthful information which it has lawfully obtained, punishment may lawfully be imposed, if at all, only when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order.'' Among those supporting The <ORGANIZATION> Easton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> appeal were the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Reporters </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. They argued that if the news media can be punished for disclosing `` accessible, trustworthy and newsworthy government records and court files, speech would be chilled to the point of being frozen solid.'' The case is <ORGANIZATION> Easton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Boettger </PERSON>, 89-265.

<HEAD>Missouri Hepatitis Carrier Loses Anti-Bias Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today refused to order a program for the handicapped in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to take back a 33-year-old mentally retarded man who is a carrier of hepatitis. The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s ouster from the program did not amount to illegal discrimination against the handicapped. Aside from his retardation, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> is blind and an active carrier of the hepatitis B virus. According to court records, he frequently exhibits maladaptive behavior such as biting and scratching. Hepatitis B is one cause of hepatitis, an infection that primarily affects the liver. Although the transmission of hepatitis B is not fully understood, most medical experts agree it is transmitted through body fluids. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> lived at the <ORGANIZATION> Woodhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, for three months in 1984, until he was discharged. The center is run in conjunction with the <ORGANIZATION> Woodhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which provides educational and vocational programs for handicapped people. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was dismissed from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> programs because he is a carrier of a contagious disease. Both the learning center and school receive federal funding, making them subject to a 1973 federal law protecting handicapped people from bias. But the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s dismissal was not a violation of the 1973 law The costs of inoculating all staff members and patients at the facilities to protect them against catching hepatitis from <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> are too high to be reasonable, the appeals court said. In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and his parents argued that the appeals court's ruling conflicts with a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that people with contagious diseases are protected by the 1973 law. The justices two years ago said recipients of federal aid may not discriminate against people with contagious diseases if those people are `` otherwise qualified'' to work or take part in some program or activity. The 1987 decision said, `` A person who poses a significant risk of communicating an infectious disease to others ... will not be otherwise qualified ... if reasonable accommodations will not eliminate that risk.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s appeal said the 8th Circuit court ignored medical judgments about what represents `` reasonable accommodations'' in his case. `` In the face of a national AIDS epidemic and the hysteria it has engendered, the 8th Circuit's misinterpretation of -LRB- the 1987 high court ruling -RRB- erodes the substantive protections provided by -LRB- the 1973 law -RRB- to both contagious individuals and the public itself,'' the appeal said. AIDS _ acquired immune deficiency syndrome _ is a deadly viral disease that can kill its victims by destroying their immune system and leaving them vulnerable to other diseases. The case is <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Woodhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Learning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 89-240.

<HEAD>Progress Reported in Peace Talks; New Fighting in Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ABDULLAH AL-SHEHRI</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lebanese lawmakers were reported to be moving closer to a peace agreement but fighting broke out today in their divided nation, a sign that any accord reached here would have to be accepted by the warlords battling for supremacy. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, sniper fire exchanges along the city's dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> claimed the first combat fatality since an Arab Legaue-brokered truce halted six months of bloodshed on Sept. 22. Police said 1st Lt. <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslan </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, was killed and three soldiers were wounded in a clash between Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>'s Moslem troops and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units in the <LOCATION> Chiyah </LOCATION> district. The casualties brought the overall toll to 930 killed and 2,744 wounded since March 8, when fighting broke out between the Christians and an alliance of Syrian troops and their Moslem allies. Conference sources in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers were backing away somewhat on their demand that Syrian forces withdraw before Christians agree to political reforms in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They said the lawmakers conceded that an immediate Syrian withdrawal would allow Moslem militias to take control of Moslem regions now controlled by the Syrians. The sources also said that a committee working on a draft proposal for political reforms has completed its recommendations on the future powers of the president, traditionally a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, formed the committee of seven Christians and seven Moslems on Monday to speed up work toward a settlement. By today, the committee had been enlarged to 18 members. Under the proposed reforms the president would continue to have the right to summon Cabinet sessions. He also will be able to decree special amnesties, but not general ones as before. Parliament bills will automatically become law if not ratified by the president within 15 days. Previously, no law could take effect unless endorsed by the president. Moslems have been demanding that presidential powers be curtailed as part of a political reforms agreement that would give them an equal share of power with the Christians. Christians, then considered the majority, have dominated the government, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and judiciary since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. But Moslems now are believed to make up a majority of the population. A three-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee had presented the 63 Parliamentarians gathered in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> with a draft peace plan. The legislators have been studying the proposal since Sept. 30 and making their own recommendations. The main obstacle that has threatened to undermine the peace conference was <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Arab committee has proposed a phased <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> withdrawal from the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area to be completed in two years, with total pullout depending on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ending its occupation of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the conclusion of a Syrian-Lebanese security pact. The Christian legislators' consent that an uncalculated Syrian withdrawal would spur more turmoil has raised speculation that a compromise was in the works, possibly based on narrowing the two-year period for a withdrawal from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that was envisaged by the Arab committee.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to decide whether a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man who murdered a deputy sheriff 10 years ago may raise the issue of his mental retardation in a new attack on his death sentence. The court's decision, expected sometime in 1990, could clarify the scope _ and retroactive effects _ of its decision last June 26 that allowed states to execute mentally retarded killers, but only if jurors were allowed to take a defendant's mental condition into consideration. The justices agreed to hear the appeal of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Selvage </PERSON>, and fashioned the sole question <PERSON> Selvage </PERSON>'s lawyers and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> prosecutors are to debate in the coming months. The question is whether there was a legitimate cause for <PERSON> Selvage </PERSON> not raising the issue of his mental retardation at some earlier stage. The justices also asked the lawyers to consider whether, if no legitimate cause existed, whether barring <PERSON> Selvage </PERSON> from making the claim now would `` result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.'' <PERSON> Selvage </PERSON> was convicted of killing <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputy, during the July 30, 1979, robbery of a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jewelry store.

 <ORGANIZATION> Soichiro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, the 82-year-old founder of <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, tonightst Japanese inducted into the Automotive Hall o becomes the firf Fame. `` In less than 30 years, Mr. <PERSON> Honda </PERSON> built an auto company that has stood toe-to-toe with all other manufacturers and has competed successfully,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallon </PERSON>, chairman of the hall. `` He changed the way Americans viewed imported cars and altered forever the role of the import in our domestic market.'' Selections to the Hall of Fame, a non-profit organization founded in 1939, are made by its board of directors, made up mostly of auto executives. The bonds, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> has said, were a `` normal method of corporate finance'' and were portrayed to potential investors as uninsured instruments. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> bought <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in 1984. Through risky direct investment in real estate and investment in other corporate junk bonds, he turned a sleepy savings bank with $ 1 billion in assets into an aggressive thrift whose assets had grown to $ 5.4 billion by 1988. The bond sales began about the same time <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s troubles with regulators began _ 1987, a time when <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> apparently desperately needed capital to stay afloat. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> examined <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> and found it was in danger of failing. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> took his case to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

In an unprecedented move, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> ordered supervision of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> transferred from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and a new examination conducted. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> celebrated with a champagne party at his <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> headquarters. Many investors could have been spared ruin had regulators' actions not been delayed two years by political influence, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikami </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fountain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, dentist who invested $ 25,000 `` The bonds never would have been sold to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investors,'' <PERSON> Mikami </PERSON> said. `` It was a mad scramble those last two years to get money in the coffers of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>.'' Four of the five senators now say they regret the appearance of political influence created by the meeting, but insist there was nothing wrong with trying to help a constituent. `` If I knew then what I know now, I would not have done any of what I did,'' said <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, who returned Keating-related campaign contributions after the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> filed its racketeering suit. `` The question is, Was I abused? The answer is yes.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> said he is now `` embarrassed'' that he attended the meeting. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> returned campaign contributions. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said that upon learning regulators had made referrals to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, he bowed out of further <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> discussions. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, who solicited <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> for a $ 400,000 contribution for his non-partisan voter education project after the meeting with regulators, has `` no regrets about trying to help a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> institution with thousands of employees and depositors who was having a rough time with red tape and delays by the federal bureaucracy,'' spokesman <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Flander </PERSON> said. Added <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenaway </PERSON>, `` The things we know now about the sale of the bonds and the confusion created _ that whole issue is something we never knew about then.'' <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to examine whether federal or state regulators were responsible in any way for the bondholders' plight, and, if so, whether the government could compensate them out of federal savings and loan insurance funds. Bondholders say that may be their only hope. `` The regulators allowed this to go on,'' said attorney-investor <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>. Even the chance of recovering some money after protracted litigation, bankruptcy proceedings or <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> policy-making is of little comfort to the elderly victims, bondholders say. `` These people need their money now,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, the Leisure World resident who organized with other bondholders to try to get their money back. `` They need to go into nursing or board-and-care homes now. They have medical bills now. They do n't have time to wait.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> visited the heartland of <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> culture today, celebrating Mass in tropical heat in a region that blends <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>, Hindu and Moslem traditions. In a meeting with religious leaders, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> cautioned against any violation of religious freedom in this overwhelmingly Moslem nation. There have been signs of pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> by Islamic extremists. Religious freedom is enshrined in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s constitution and it is up to the state to ensure that `` religious freedom is indeed a fundamental human right, one which should be enjoyed by all religious communities, as well as individuals,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told the religious leaders. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials said the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was reflecting the concerns of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s bishops over two proposed laws viewed by the minority church as unconstitutional. One would require Islamic instruction in all public and private schools including Catholic ones. The other would give legal recognition to several hundred Islamic courts. The church considers <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> a generally tolerant country despite the small numbers of Catholics, only 5 million compared with 157 million Moslems. For the Mass today, about 150,000 people, many wearing yellow and white baseball caps _ the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> colors _ jammed the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> air force academy grounds. Barefoot Javanese women in sarongs strewed rose petals in the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s path as he walked along a red carpet after changing for the mass. The pope, speaking from an alter flanked by a vintage World War II fighter plane, emphasized the importance of local tradition in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` Remember you build up the universal church when you bring to it the unique riches of the <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> culture,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, speaking in English. He made a one-hour flight from <LOCATION> Jakarta </LOCATION>, the capital, to the southern edge of Java on the second day of his pilgrimage to the world's most populous Moslem country. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> estimated that Catholics make up only about 2 percent of the more than 17 million people in the diocese of <LOCATION> Jogjakarta </LOCATION>. But the crowds were large and enthusiastic. Tens of thousands arrived before dawn, hours before the mass, walking on dirt roads covered by dense tropical vegetation. A Javanese orchestra called a gamelan accompanied the choir with drums, cymbals and gongs. <LOCATION> Jogjakarta </LOCATION> is surrounded by temples set in rice paddy fields. The <ORGANIZATION> Borobudur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> is considered one of the world's greatest <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monuments. In 1983 it was damaged by Moslem extremists. Also nearby is a temple complex dedicated to <ORGANIZATION> Shiva </ORGANIZATION>, the Hindu goddess, a sign of the ancient Indian tradition.

<HEAD>Court to Use Convicted California Robber's Case in Police Search
Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to use the case of a convicted <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> robber to dispel some uncertainty over when items seized in a police search may be used against criminal suspects. The court said it will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, sentenced to 8 years and 8 months in prison for robbery, illegal firearms possession and other charges. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> was convicted in a holdup on Jan. 13, 1985, of <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallaker </PERSON>, the treasurer of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> coin club. <PERSON> Wallaker </PERSON> was returning home from a coin show with two briefcases containing $ 10,000 in cash and $ 20,000 in coins. He was accosted by two people wearing Halloween masks who stunned him with an electrical device and also stole jewelry from him. <PERSON> Wallaker </PERSON> told police he recognized <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s voice, a distinct Southern drawl. The police searched <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s home and found an Uzi, a revolver, two stun guns and keys for handcuffs. None of those items was listed in the court warrant that authorized the search. The warrant did describe the items stolen from Wallaker, but they were not found by police. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> argued that the seized items should not be used as evidence against him, even though they were in plain view. He said the items were not discovered inadvertently by police. The police expected to find weapons in his home and came there looking for them, he said. Also, he argued, the police could not show a sufficient connection with the items and holdup. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> relied heavily on a 1971 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case which allowed police to use evidence found in plain view only if discovered inadvertently. But a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> appeals court permitted the items police found in <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s home to be used against him. The state court said the 1971 high court ruling on evidence found in plain view was endorsed by only four justices _ not five of the nine _ and therefore does not establish a national precedent. Also, the state court said of the police conduct in searching <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>'s home, `` There is no indication that they used the warrant as a pretext to conduct a general exploratory search of horton's residence. The case is <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 88-7164.

<TEXT>
 Authorities have released a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief plane, its crew and its passengers nearly three weeks after they were detained following an emergency landing in northeastern <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, officials said today. Army commander <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said the twin-engine C119 Fairchild, its two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> pilots, two British passengers and three Kenyan crewmen were released Friday. <PERSON> Tarcis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabwegyere </PERSON>, minister of state for foreign affairs, said the foreigners and the aircraft were expected to leave for <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials, who have not released the names of those aboard the plane, were not immediately available for comment. The plane made an emergency landing Sept. 22 in <LOCATION> Kaabong </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> after running out of fuel in bad weather. It was trying to return to <LOCATION> Lokichoggio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, after delivering emergency food and other supplies to southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> as part of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> relief operation. <LOCATION> Kaabong </LOCATION> is about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Lokichoggio </LOCATION>, which has served as a staging point for the U.N.-coordinated relief effort. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has been airlifting food and supplies from <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> since April in an effort to stave off massive famine deaths. <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> said the Ugandans detained those on board the plane `` pending finalization of investigations'' in which they confirmed the plane did indeed make the unauthorized landing due to an emergency. Government officials said earlier they held the plane to determine whether its crew and passengers had any `` ill intentions.'' Last year, a Kenyan-registered plane delivered military equipment and supplies to rebels fighting the government of President <PERSON> Yower </PERSON> <PERSON> Museveni </PERSON>. The goods were seized by the military.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> today reported an engine problem that could ground space shuttle Atlantis beyond Thursday's launch date even if anti-nuclear activists lose their court challenge to stop the flight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> began hearing arguments today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from attorneys representing <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and three citizens groups seeking to halt liftoff because <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> will be carrying a plutonium-powered space probe. Shuttle test director <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinbach </PERSON> said overnight checks found that a controller on one of the three main engines was giving a faulty fuel pressure reading. The device controls the engine during the liftoff burn. Experts were analyzing the situation to see if the controller had to be replaced, a task that could take five or six days. A decision was not expected until late in the day today or Wednesday. Sources said that after the first low pressure reading, four more tests were conducted, and the problem did not repeat itself. <PERSON> Leinbach </PERSON> said other countdown tasks were proceeding normally despite four inches of rain overnight. The main job today was loading fuel aboard the shuttle's power-producing fuel cells. The countdown ticked toward a liftoff at 1:29 p.m. Thursday with the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft on board. Opponents sought a temporary restraining order because <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, which Atlantis' five astronauts are to dispatch toward Jupiter, carries two generators fueled by 49.4 pounds of plutonium. They contend an explosion like that which destroyed the shuttle Challenger in 1986 could scatter plutonium over heavily populated east-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> responds that in tests empty plutonium containers have been blown up, shot at and burned to determine how they would survive all kinds of accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater than those produced in the Challenger accident, the agency reports. Similar devices have been carried on 22 other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spacecraft without a problem. `` We're going to count down to a launch on Thursday unless we are told to stop,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> test director <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said Monday as the countdown started. About 25 people held a brief demonstration at the space center Monday, staging a mock countdown and then collapsing in mock death when a woman sprinkled powder representing plutonium. They said that if they lost in court they would attempt to stop the liftoff by infiltrating the launch area in a non-violent occupation. `` We're going to attempt to put people on the launch pad if the court does n't prevent the launch,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, one of the three groups that filed suit. Reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough. More than 200 security guards armed with M-16 assault rifles and semiautomatic 9mm pistols will patrol the 140,000-acre space center to stop any infiltrators, and the center also will be guarded by helicopters and boats. Only a 10-minute launch window exists on Thursday, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials are concerned that time could easily be lost dealing with protesters who might penetrate the launch danger zone with a boat, plane or on foot. The five astronauts assigned to the mission flew to the Kennedy Space Center Monday from their training base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for final launch preparations. They were to be briefed today on the flight plan and progress of the countdown. The commander is <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON> and mission specialists <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON>.

 Protected by thousands of soldiers and police, the presidents of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> met today in this small desert town to discuss a common strategy for dealing with the region's cocaine lords. The meeting was expected to include criticism of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s emphasis on military-style repression of the cocaine trade. Both <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> have called for increased economic aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to provide alternate sources of income for the hundreds of thousands of peasants who grow coca, the raw material for cocaine. Today's gathering took place under heavy security to defend against feared attacks by the fanatical Shining Path guerrilla group, which works in alliance with cocaine traffickers in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s coca-growing highland jungles <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s president <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> received Presidents <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> this morning at an air force base in <LOCATION> Pisco </LOCATION>, 45 miles northwest of here, then flew with them by helicopter to <ORGANIZATION> Ica </ORGANIZATION> where they were to meet for two hours and issue a joint communique. There was no word late this morning on details of the closed meeting. Meanwhile, a bomb exploded in a nearby city where ministers of eight Latin American nations are planning another high-level meeting in <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION> that is to follow today's gathering. The bomb exploded before dawn today in the northern city of <LOCATION> Trujillo </LOCATION>, 350 miles north of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, where ministers of five Latin American nations were preparing the agenda for a meeting of eight Latin American presidents. No group claimed responsibility for the attack, which caused minor damage to a government building half a mile from the hotel where the ministers were meeting. <ORGANIZATION> Ica </ORGANIZATION>, a remote town of 350,000 people 185 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, has limited road access and was chosen for the meetings because it affords better security than the capital, government officials said. An army battalion was guarding the town's two entrances while about 3,000 police officers were in charge of security at the plush <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dunas </LOCATION> hotel, where the meetings are being held. Security was stepped up after <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas launched attacks in <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION> and the surrounding area in the days preceding the summit. Presidents <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanguinetti </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> will join <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> in discussions of drug trafficking, the failed coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign debt and ecological damage to the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>. But most attention has focused on today's `` drug summit,'' which was expected to produce a demand for greater <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. Peruvian officials have been sharply critical of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s emphasis on repression to halt cocaine trafficking rather than economic development that would encourage peasants to shift to crops other than coca. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> produce more than 90 percent of the world's coca Colombian drug cartels turn semi-refined coca paste from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boliva </LOCATION> into pure cocaine and smuggle it into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands of peasants make their livelihood from growing coca in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, and officials in both countries say coca can not be eradicated without providing the growers with an alternative source of income. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently announced $ 261 million in aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> to fight the cocaine trade, but most of it is in military aid. `` It's not a problem of donating some helicopters, sometimes very old helicopters, or donating rifles or bullets. It's an economic problem,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said recently. `` It would be enough to offer a good price and a guaranteed market for the products that could substitute for coca.''

<HEAD>Court to Resolve Extra Prison Time Issue in Missouri Case</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today agreed to resolve a conflict over federal laws authorizing extra prison time for some criminals. The justices said they will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajuane </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who said he improperly was sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty in federal court in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to illegal firearm possession. The judge increased <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s sentence because of his previous felony convictions. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> argued that the judge improperly based the enhanced sentence on his prior convictions for the non-violent crime of second degree burglary. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said under <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law burglary in the second degree includes breaking into an empty building where there is no potential for violence. But the 8th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled in January that breaking into an empty building has potential for violent harm to innocent people. The building owner may return or a neighbor may investigate, the appeals court said in upholding <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s sentence. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had two previous convictions for second degree burglary in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and one robbery conviction. At issue is the interpretation of laws <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed in 1986 against drug abuse and career criminals. The laws permit those convicted of three previous felonies to be given longer sentences because of their past crimes. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deleted a definition of burglary, creating confusion over its use as a basis for enhanced prison terms. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, despite the omission, intended to retain a broad definition of burglary. But <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> argued that since there is no specific definition of burglary in the federal laws, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> meant the common law definition to apply. Under that theory, he said, the courts should accept the definition used in the state where the alleged crime occurs. Also, <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said, the 8th Circuit court's interpretation will mean longer sentences for many inmates, threatening more overcrowding in the nation's prisons. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said other federal appeals courts disagree with the 8th Circuit court's interpretation. The case is <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 88-7194.

Almost all the supplies that come to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> from other parts of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have to go through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> first. Soviet troops moved into the region last week to break an economic blockade that has been strangling <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> for nearly three months, and <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> for even longer. About 400 trains with 60,000 cars have been reported idled on the tracks in the region. In the past 24 hours, authorities did manage to push 1,748 rail cars of supplies through to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said today. But those cars did not carry any oil, and the republic remains strapped for fuel, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting a speech by Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> to the Supreme Soviet legislature. <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> said transport in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> is still difficult due to `` blown-up bridges and continuing strafing of trains.'' Much of the cargo that does arrive in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on its main rail artery through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> has been damaged beyond repair, Pravda reported today. Factory-built temporary houses for victims of last year's Armenian earthquake were smashed into piles of metal, broken glass and crushed window frames, it said Pre-furnished rooms for the earthquake reconstruction project arrived with ovens, sinks, pipes and beds ruined, and `` they simply can not be restored,'' Pravda said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said it was particularly difficult to restore transport of supplies in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The regions of <LOCATION> Martuninski </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gadrutski </PERSON> have been cut off since a bridge was blown up Saturday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said. It also said weapons were found hidden in sacks of flour on an Armenian helicopter relief flight. The pilot denied any knowledge of the weapons.

 Six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> over the past six months, a Colombian publisher told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The Colombian press `` continues to be trapped in cross-fires'' between the government and guerrillas and drug lords, which it is battling, said <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>. `` This occurs in a country where there exists a policy of free press and a goverment that is respectful of criticism _ but not of real guarantees for their full exercise,'' <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said Monday in an address to the association's annual meeting. About 450 editors and publishers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> are attending the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 45th general assembly in this northern industrial city. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulibarri </PERSON>, vice president of the association's <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, singled out <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as `` the two most critical cases this year.'' <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> of the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombiano </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, home of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, said at a seminar that he and his colleagues are afraid: `` We're scared to death.'' Reporters for <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colombiano </ORGANIZATION> have been killed and bombs have been found in the newspaper's offices. After the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government declared war on the country's cocaine barons in August, drug gangs declared `` total war'' on the journalists who had helped expose them <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said that, as a result, the Colombian press omits the names of judges and magistrates that handle narcotics cases and the names of government officials `` on the front lines of this struggle.'' To protect journalists, newspaper stories about drug traffickers do not carry reporters' bylines and reports about terrorist activities have been played down to avoid `` playing the terrorists' game,'' <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said `` The permanent climate of terrorism _ psychological and real _ has obliged the press to take exceptional measures to protect itself,'' he said. <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said 10 journalists were kidnapped for several days in May and June by Marxist guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to pressure them into publishing messages from the organization. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, editor for the daily <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> that was bombed last month by drug traffickers, urged the <ORGANIZATION> IAPA </ORGANIZATION> to find a way `` to combat this tremendous flogging.'' `` We must all look for a solution so we do n't have a press dominated by the narcotics-trafficking mafia,'' he said. <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, whose brother was killed in 1986 by drug traffickers, told the group that <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> journalists receive death threats against themselves and their families and require bodyguards. He said newspaper advertisers also have been threatened by the drug lords. Reporting on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cristiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> of La Prensa of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> said that, despite official promises of press freedom, reprisals by that country's leftist Sandinista government are common against the news media. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper, is owned by her mother, <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, the opposition coalition's presidential candidate for February 1990 elections <PERSON> Cristiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s promise two years ago to permit the creation of an independent television station remains unfulfilled, a Nicaraguan-born reporter was expelled from the country and radio stations are censored or forced to broadcast government news. The situation has improved for journalists working in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, publishers from these two <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries reported. `` Several newspapers that were closed at the beginning of the current military government -LRB- of Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> -RRB- are now in circulation,'' <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Filippi </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epoca </ORGANIZATION> said. But he said <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabieses </PERSON>, editor of the ultra-leftist magazine Punto Final, has been charged with `` presumed offenses against the president ...'' Cabieses has been charged in court, but has not been arrested. The magazine, banned since late President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s overthrow in 1973, was allowed to publish again in September

 About 20 people wearing blue ribbons stood outside court in support of two lawmen today as they went on trial on charges of plotting to kidnap a suspected drug dealer and torture him with a hot curling iron.

No kidnapping took place. Many residents were outraged by the arrests and held a $ 50-a-plate fund-raiser for the officers' legal expenses.

<TEXT>
 East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honocker </PERSON> today compared the pro-democracy uprising in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> with the unrest in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and criticized what he said was a campaign to defame the Communist countries. Municipal officials took a softer line in the East German city of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, however, allowing 70,000 protesters to rally for reform in the city center. The official tolerance of Monday's peaceful march for an end to authoritarian rule contrasted sharply with the violence police used to break up similar demonstrations over the weekend in six East German cities. Despite the new tolerance in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> gave no indication that he is about to change his government's course. In a meeting with Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON>, he said: `` Any attempt of imperialism to destabilize the socialist construction or to slander its successes and achievements is now, and will be in the future, nothing other than fruitless charging of <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Quixote </PERSON> against the ever-moving blades of a windmill,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> recalled the events of last June in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, when troops crushed the Chinese pro-democracy movement. `` In this respect, there is a fundamental lesson to be learned from the counter-revolutionary revolt in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the present defamation campaign against the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- and other Socialist states,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. That statement appeared to signal <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s willingness to crush dissent, if necessary. Also today, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolpe </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said there were `` working groups'' of government and church officials who were discussing the current unrest in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. But he denied a West German radio report that said high-level talks had been held between church leaders and government officials. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Furian </PERSON>, a Lutheran church provost in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, said in an interview that `` positive developments in our nation can only come about if a new orientation breaks through.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must give up its grip on total power,'' he said. `` It ca n't happen with anything less.'' Over the weekend, hundreds of people were arrested in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and other cities by club-swinging police. West German television said many already were sentenced to jail terms of up to six months. <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, an industrial city of 500,000, has been the scene of several clashes in recent weeks as police moved to crush demonstrations stirred in part by an exodus of disillusioned citizens to the West. After two nights of clashes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, many feared police would also use violence to break up Monday's peace march in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. But beforehand, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Leipzig </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> promised to push for a talks between citizens and the government. `` We all need a free exchange of ideas about how we should continue socialism in our nation,'' the officials said in a statement. The message was read over <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> state radio during services at four city churches and over loudspeakers during the demonstration, witnesses said. Police and paramilitary troops watched the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> march, but did not intervene. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonneberger </PERSON>, pastor for the Lukas Lutheran church in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, said he was surprised by the restraint. He told <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network that some demonstrators even `` began conversations with paramilitary troops'' when the crowd was dispersing. West German radio also reported peaceful demonstrations Monday in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Plauen </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Halle </PERSON>. There is no indication, however, that the government intends to soften its tough stand against the reforms sweeping such East bloc allies as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But Monday's demonstrations were far different from the weekend marches across the country of 16.6 million people, when police marched into crowds of demonstrators and hit, chased and arrested hundreds. Protesters paraded through <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday shouting, `` We Need Freedom,'' `` Democracy,'' and `` No Violence,'' witnesses said on condition of anonymity. The march was the largest single protest in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since a 1953 workers uprising was put down by Soviet tanks. Earlier Monday, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> denounced the East German government as `` rigidly authoritarian'' and said relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> `` can not prosper'' under present conditions. Also, 18 Lutheran leaders issued an appeal in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> calling on the government to implement democratic reforms and urging all sides to refrain from violence. At least 50,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months, either over <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s newly-open border to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> or after seeking refuge in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The exodus deeply embarrassed the government on its two-day 40th anniversary festivities, which were attended by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> hinted that he favors for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> the types of reforms he is overseeing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Soviet Advisers Likely Still Involved in Afghanistan: US</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is still providing `` vast amounts'' of weapons and other support to the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> government, and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that it seems likely Soviet advisers are still involved in the fighting. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has said its last troops were withdrawn from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday editions that a confidential <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration intelligence report said <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> advisers wearing Afghan uniforms were launching Scud missiles at rebels. `` It seems a likely conclusion, but I can not be more specific,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said about Soviet involvement. `` Our position is still the same, that the Soviets are supplying vast amounts of weapons and money and support to the <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> government and we similarly are staying involved on that basis. But I ca n't get into people and so forth.'' Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believed the Soviets have withdrawn, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` We feel they've withdrawn from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, yes. But Soviet aid is still going back in.'' The Times said American intelligence agencies prepared the report for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the White House. Since the Soviet pullout, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has continued massive shipments of arms, food and fuel to buttress the government of President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, in turn, has kept up military shipments to guerillas trying to oust <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials had predicted an quick victory for the rebels once the Soviet troops left, but the guerillas have gained little ground and have been beset with infighting. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> furnished an estimated $ 600 million in military aid to the Afghan rebels last year and more than $ 2.3 billion over the past nine years.

 Soviet mushers will compete for the first time this winter in the 1,100-mile Iditarod sled dog race and will get their training and equipment from three-time champion <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>. Butcher is taking a crash course in Russian for the 1,100-mile trek and provided dogs and sleds for the two Soviets, who arrive Nov. 1 for four months of training with <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Monson </PERSON>. `` They'll be using my dogs this year,'' she said Monday. `` In subsequent races, they'll be bringing over their own. `` There's just not enough time to make a trained racing team out of inexperienced racers. They know how to work dogs, but that's quite different from racing They're coming over with nothing but their cold-weather gear.'' In its 17 years, the Anchorage-to-Nome race has included mushers from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, among other nations, but none from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, Iditarod executive director, said the Soviets also have agreed to help organize an invitational Alaska-Soviet race in 1991. It would cover about 1,000 miles from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> port city of <LOCATION> Anadyr </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets are not familiar with sled dog racing as we know it _ especially long-distance racing,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` They'll train here, in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, and then they'll return to train others. One of the Soviets is <PERSON> Nicholai </PERSON> <PERSON> Yettiye </PERSON>, 25, a secondary school physical education teacher and a member of an expedition that traveled 1,000 miles last spring by sled dog and kayak from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The other is <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Reznyuk </PERSON>, 43, chairman of a regional sports committee. Fifty-four mushers have signed up for the 1990 Iditarod, scheduled to begin March 4 and pay out $ 275,000 in prize money. Butcher and <PERSON> Monson </PERSON> supplied a dog team for an Australian musher in 1985 and for a Norwegian in 1986. The Norwegian, <PERSON> Rune </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesthammer </PERSON>, came in 10th and was Rookie of the Year, <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> said. Butcher has 130 dogs in her kennel, more than enough to go around.

These include imprisonment of prisoners of conscience, torture and ill treatment, detention without trial and unfair trials, and executions, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> called for an end to <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s national security laws, which outlaw some forms of legitimate freedom of expression, provide for indefinite detention without trial, and have permitted `` grossly unfair'' political trials ending in death sentences. It said impartial investigations into alleged extrajudicial executions were urgent as were safeguards to prevent such executions happing again. The group said the government has released hundreds of political prisoners since 1988, but other suspected government opponents and political prisoners remain in detention, including two who have been held for more than 10 years. An <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> delegation visited <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> in June for the first time in 20 years, and said it received assurances from <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> and other government officials that they would cooperate in protecting human rights. On July 13, however, several prominent government critics were arrested in the capital of <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said, including <PERSON> Ismail </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumaale </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossobleh </PERSON>, a lawyer who has defended political prisoners, and <PERSON> Abdulkadir </PERSON> <PERSON> Aden </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON>, a former government minister and son of <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s first president. Both are being held without charge or trial in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it regards them as prisoners of conscience and appealed to the Somali government for their immediate and unconditional release. The organization also said it raised with the government the reported killings of people arrested in <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> after demonstrations on July 14. At least 46 people were reported to have been summarily executed by soldiers on a beach near <LOCATION> Jezira </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, on July 15. A survivor is said to have reported the killings to the minister of <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION>, and the president has ordered an investigation, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> had earlier denied the reported executions. It said illegal executions by the Somali security forces, which were widespread in the north after attacks by the <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in May 1988, have also been reported this year in different parts of the country. <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> took power in the one-party state on Oct. 21, 1969.

<TEXT>
 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> said Tuesday that religious freedom must be preserved in this overwhelmingly Moslem nation, where there have been signs of pressure on the small <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority. Religious freedom is enshrined in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s constitution and the state should make sure it `` is is indeed a fundamental human right, one which should be enjoyed by all religious communities, as well as individuals,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told a group of Islamic and other religious leaders. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesmen said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was reflecting concerns of <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops about two proposed laws the church considers unconstitutional. One would require Islamic instruction in all public and private schools, including <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> institutions, and the other would give legal recognition to hundreds of Islamic courts. The church considers <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> generally tolerant, but views the proposed laws as signs of growing pressure by Islamic fundamentalists on Roman Catholics, who number only 5 million in a nation of 157 million Moslems. Foreign missionaries told reporters Tuesday in <LOCATION> Jogjakarta </LOCATION>, a city in central Java where the pontiff pope celebrated Mass, that fundamentalists threatened harm to local residents who provided housing to <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> pilgrims. Nonetheless, an enthusiastic crowd of more than 150,000 assembled in sweltering tropical heat for the Mass on the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> Indonesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>. Barefoot young women in sarongs strewed rose petals in <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s path as he walked on a red carpet. He spoke from an altar flanked by World War II fighter planes. <LOCATION> Jogjakarta </LOCATION>, considered Java's cultural heartland, is surrounded by temples set in rice paddies. The <ORGANIZATION> Borobudur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION>, considered one of the world's great <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monuments, was damaged by Moslem extremists in 1983. A temple complex dedicated to <ORGANIZATION> Shiva </ORGANIZATION>, the Hindu goddess, also is nearby. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Antara </ORGANIZATION> reported from <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, on the pope's schedule for Wednesday, that a woman dropped dead in front of a statue of the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Gelora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samador </LOCATION> stadium, where he is to say Mass. She was described as a descendant of a local king. No cause of death was given.

They arrived minutes after the second explosion. <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> offered no motive for the bombings and said it was too soon to say for certain whether the attacks were connected.

Police Chief <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rheam </PERSON> said school would be opened Wednesday after a thorough search of the building. `` We're not going to allow anyone to come back to school with the possibility of anyone being injured,'' he said. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a freshman, and other students lingering outside the school said they were uneasy about returning to class. `` I think ... they should cancel school for a certain number of days because we're risking our lives,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` I even have a fear of something blowing out into my face while I'm walking down the hall. It could be anywhere.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today allowed the use of an anti-racketeering law against 26 abortion opponents for incidents at a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> clinic. The justices, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that use of the racketeering law violated the protesters' free-speech rights. The protesters were sued successfully by operators of the abortion clinic. Similar lawsuits, each invoking the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -LRB- RICO -RRB-, have been filed against anti-abortion activists in cities such as <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Califa </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, recently wrote: `` The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> believes that civil RICO's potential for chilling First Amendment rights of expression is enormous. The concern centers on the possibility political protesters will be labeled `` racketeers'' and held financially liable for doing nothing more than expressing their views. But in upholding a $ 108,000 award against the 26 <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> protesters last March, the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said their actions `` went beyond ... constitutional rights of speech and protest.'' The protesters on four occasions from 1984 to 1986 unlawfully entered the Northeast Women's Center in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. According to trial testimony, protesters threw medical supplies on the floor, damaged equipment, assaulted the clinic's employees and harassed patients. `` An assistant district attorney who witnessed a demonstration testified that the demonstrators' activity rose to a ` frenzy' and that he delayed leaving the center out of fear for his phsyical safety,'' the appeals court noted. It added: `` Civil RICO could appropriately be applied to defendants' intimidation and harassment of the center resulting in the destruction of its property.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, said `` this is one battle in a long war. We intend to continue our efforts to non-violently save children and mothers from abortion at the abortion facilities. This case will not deter that one bit.'' The 26 protesters are members of the coalition. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiryak </PERSON>, attorney for Northeast Women's Center, said `` this decision shows that our society will not tolerate the use of fear and intimidation by religious fanatics to impose their will on women seeking abortion services.'' In other action, the court: _ Agreed to decide whether a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> man who murdered a deputy sheriff 10 years ago may raise the issue of his mental retardation in a new attack on his death sentence. The court's decision, expected sometime in 1990, could clarify the scope _ and retroactive effects _ of its decision last June 26 that allowed states to execute mentally retarded killers but nly if jurors were allowed to take a defendant's mental condition into consideration. _ Agreed to use the case of a convicted <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> robber to dispel some uncertainty over when items seized in a police search may be used against criminal suspects. The court said it will hear an appeal by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brice </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, sentenced to 8 years and 8 months in prison for robbery, illegal firearms possession and other charges. _ Overturned a fine against a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> newspaper for publishing conversations of a bookmaker whose customer's telephone was tapped by police. The justices ordered a state court to reconsider a $ 1,000 fine and $ 17,409 in lawyers' fees imposed against The <ORGANIZATION> Easton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper carried a story based on wiretap transcripts accidentally placed in public court records. The high court said the case should be restudied in light of the justices' ruling last June that spared a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> newspaper from having to pay damages to a rape victim whose name it published. _ Agreed to resolve a dispute in the federal prosecution of nine <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> men accused of robbing $ 7.2 million from a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> six years ago. The justices said they will decide whether all the tape recordings made during court-authorized electronic surveillance of the defendants may be used as trial evidence. A federal appeals court ruled that some of the tapes may not be used as evidence because they were not sealed for safekeeping quickly enough. In the abortion-protest appeal acted on today, lawyers for the 26 protesters decried `` an unprecedented and dangerous expansion of'' the federal law primarily aimed at fighting organized crime. `` Under the 3rd Circuit's interpretations of RICO ... <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was a racketeer when he trespassed on private property and conspired with others in an attempt to change the business policies of owners of segregated lunch counters,'' the appeal contended. `` So, too, is anyone participating in a sit-in against apartheid with the goal of changing the investment policies of a university,'' the appeal said, arguing that no RICO violation should be found if no economic profit motive exists. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case so the court could consider whether a profit-making element is needed for RICO prosecutions. Four such votes are needed to grant review. Lawyers for the clinic urged the justices to reject the appeal, and accused the 26 protesters of deceptively trying to portray their demonstrations as peaceful. `` Those individuals who engaged in peaceful and protected activities are not and were never parties to this case. The -LRB- 26 -RRB- are those who exceeded the bounds of protected activity and engaged in violent and unlawful activities,'' the clinic's lawyers said. The case is <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON> vs. Northeast Women's Center, 88-2137.

 A jury has concluded that a defective football helmet allowed a former high school athlete to suffer a severe brain injury and has awarded the young man $ 11.2 million. The helmet made by the <ORGANIZATION> Bike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was unreasonably dangerous, leading to acute bleeding within the brain of <LOCATION> Richard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, then 16, a <ORGANIZATION> Multnomah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury decided Monday in an 11-1 vote. <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, now 20, has severe, irreversible mental and physical impairments and requires 24-hour care. It apparently was the first time that an injury case involving a Bike helmet has been presented to a jury. Bike has been in the helmet business since 1976. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bocci </PERSON>, an attorney for <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and his parents, <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Perla </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, said several other cases against <PERSON> Bike </PERSON> had been settled out of court without disclosure of payments. <PERSON> Bocci </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pippin </PERSON>, also representing the Austrias, contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Bike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> model helmet worn by <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> had not been adequately tested before the company marketed it. Bike and the <ORGANIZATION> Kendall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which tested helmets for Bike, are both liable for damages. Both are subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Peery </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> lawyer for Bike, told jurors last week that helmets similar to the one worn by <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> are used by 80 percent of the players in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, from junior high school teams to professionals The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> model contains a bladder at the crown of the helmet that is inflated with air. Other padding includes foam strips, called sizers, that come in various sizes. Lawyers for the Austrias contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> model for large heads did not meet national testing standards, although smaller helmets did pass the tests. They said detailed company testing records were blank between 1981 and 1984. <PERSON> Peery </PERSON> argued that no helmet could eliminate the risk of a subdural hematoma, bleeding in the brain caused by a blow, and contended there was no proof that a football injury caused <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s hematoma. <PERSON> Peery </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> had ignored advice from his physician not to play football while he suffered headaches. Jurors concluded that <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> was 2 percent at fault, thus reducing the total award of damages from $ 11.40 million to $ 11.19 million. <PERSON> Bocci </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> would need $ 5.2 million to provide for daily care the rest of his life. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> lawyer representing Bike, said there was a strong chance of an appeal.

 Lawyers for three environmental groups argued today for a court order stopping Thursday's scheduled launch of a nuclear-powered probe from the space shuttle on the ground `` there is a very high probability of an accident.'' But lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> countered that the $ 1.5 billion, six-year mission to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> carried `` very low risks'' and that even a few days delay would force the agency to drop some of its scientific objectives. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> took the case under advisement after hearing 2 -LCB- hours of argument and did not indicate when he will rule. The countdown for the flight began Monday morning. The environmental groups, led by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, asked <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the launch, scheduled from the Kennedy Space Center at 1:29 p.m. EDT Thursday. Even if the suit is dismissed, an engine problem discovered overnight could delay the launch several days should repairs be needed, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The fundamental issue in this case is whether the defendants adequately complied'' with environmental laws, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> argued for the environmental groups. `` Our concern is that for the first time 50 pounds of plutonium are being sent off into space from the space shuttle ... where there is a high probability of an accident.'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said government studies show that the statistical probability of a shuttle accident is one in 78 and that the Galileo mission, which involves the space probe looping around <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> twice for momentum, each provides further opportunity for mishap that would spread plutonium pollution. `` If ever a case needs to comply fully to the letter of the law, this one is it,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, which claims the possibility of an accident causing plutonium contamination to be extremely remote, has insufficient historical data on which to base such a conclusion. `` Columbus did n't have much experience either,'' said Judge <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>. `` He was n't going to contaminate the world either,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer arguing the case for the space agency, said the two nuclear generators aboard <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> are similar to the 38 that have flown previously on 22 missions, none on the space shuttle. Although three of those flights had accidents, he said, only one resulted in any dispersal of plutonium _ and that it acted as it was designed to do at the time, in 1964. Since then, the nuclear generators have gotten better shielding.

 Members of a small club get to sample international foods normally forbidden to them under strict Jewish dietary laws, thanks to a hotel's executive chef who experiments and adapts recipes. The Kosher Dining Club, with more than 200 members, gathers every six weeks at the Sheraton Inner Harbor Hotel for meals prepared by chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>. Among other things, the dietary laws set in the Old Testament require that animals be slaughtered in a specific way, forbid the mixture of dairy products with meat, and forbid eating shellfish and cloven-footed animals such as pigs. Cooking for the club is `` always a challenge,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. `` I've always got to work from non-kosher recipes and kosher-ize them.'' For example, for a meal that featured Scandinavian food, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had to substitute the hams and cheeses common to the Nordic diet with corned beef, fish and appetizers without dairy products. `` It takes a lot of investigation and experimentation to come up with a winner, and still keep it kosher,'' he said. And on Mexican night, a consultant from the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> even complimented the food, <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said. `` He kept saying that he could n't believe how authentic it was,'' he said. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said many of his recipes are also health-conscious, low in cholesterol and light in texture, differing from the sometimes heavy, traditional Jewish food. `` I guess you can call this kosher nouvelle,'' said <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, who began his training in a kosher hotel kitchen in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The Kosher Dining Club was the brainchild of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zetlin </PERSON>, who runs the kosher catering service at the hotel. Every six weeks since he called together some friends for the first meal in 1986, he goes to the library to research a country and writes to its embassy for suggestions on authentic recipes. The Sheraton's kitchen carries the certification of the <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, whose monitoring assures guests that the service is kosher.

<HEAD>Police Get the Drop On Suspect in Night Deposit Scam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police are warning residents of this <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb to not always believe what they read, especially when it comes to notes taped to bank night deposit slots. A 39-year-old man was arrested Sunday and accused of taping notes to night deposit boxes at two banks. The notes told customers the deposit boxes were out of service and directed them instead to put their money in a nearby <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> drop box. `` It was typed _ it looked fairly official,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Officer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> spotted one of the notes on his beat and police made a hurried check of other banks. They found one more note, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Police staked out both locations and arrested <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsaker </PERSON> while he was allegeding loading a mailbox into his pickup. No night deposits were found in either mailbox. `` Initially, he's been charged with forgery, going with the premise that the bank did n't make the note,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Police said similar scams have been reported in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grapevine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, Grand Prairie and <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> had a warning for bank customers: `` My word to people is if they see any notes on the night deposit boxes, do n't put any money in there. No legitimate bank would do something like that.'' <PERSON> Hunsaker </PERSON>, being held in lieu of $ 8,740.50 bail, also faced 14 outstanding check forgery warrants, officials said.

<HEAD>Mexico City's New Traffic Rules Go Unenforced</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Strict new traffic regulations and higher fines went into effect in the world's largest city this week, but they seem to have had little effect on the normally chaotic traffic. At the major intersection of Paseo de la Reforma and <ORGANIZATION> Avenida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurgentes </ORGANIZATION>, a pollution-blackened statue of <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s last Aztec king, presided over a scene even more confusing than usual `` There is n't any change in the traffic,'' said <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tejeda </PERSON>, a 48-year-old physicist in an orange <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only change is going to be in the attitude of the police. They're going to rob more from people.'' Illegal turns and mass jay-walking were out of control. Motorists generally disregarded seatbelt requirements. And policemen could do precious little about it _ they had no ticket books. For weeks, street vendors have been hawking copies of the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulations </ORGANIZATION>, prepping <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 19 million residents for the tenfold increase in traffic fines that went into effect Monday. Some drivers and pedestrians were n't aware that the regulations took effect this week. `` I've seen them selling the booklets in the street, but I did n't know the new rules were in effect already,'' said driver <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriaga </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> published the new rules in August. In addition to stiffening fines for such offenses as running red lights, illegal turns or jaywalking, the new rules add a few offenses to the list, among them driving without a seatbelt and necking while driving. Until Monday, the fines for violations ranged from 100 to 500 pesos _ 4 cents to 20 cents. The new regulations provide fines equaling one to five times the minimum daily wage, or $ 3.60 to $ 18. `` We're just briefing drivers, inviting them to respect the new rules and not commit infractions,'' said transit officer <PERSON> Basilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Haro </PERSON> as a van tried to pull an illegal left at the <LOCATION> Insurgentes-Reforma </LOCATION> traffic circle. `` Good afternoon. You're obstructing the turnout. You have to be careful because the new regulations are in effect,'' <PERSON> Haro </PERSON> told the driver. The fine for the turn, once four cents, is three days' minimum wage, or 24,000 pesos, about $ 9. But <PERSON> Haro </PERSON> could n't write a ticket because his old ticket book based on the former regulations has been taken away and he does n't expect to get a new one for 15 days. Violations went on all around him. A pair of young vendors on the street corner said they sell about 40 copies of the new regulations a day, at 3,000 pesos, or $ 1.20, each. A 32-year-old insurance company employee who stopped to buy a copy said she wanted to be know her rights in order to avoid police extortion. `` The fines were insignificant, before,'' said <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Barragan </PERSON>. `` Now that they're higher, they're going to increase the bribes,'' she said, and turned to cross the street in the middle of the block. A retired policeman, who was chatting nearby with an on-duty colleague, denied the charge. `` Bribes have always been encouraged by the lawbreakers so they wo n't have to go out of their way to pay fines,'' he said. He refused to give his name. A taxi driver, waiting on the curbside for a fare, said he used his seatbelt for the first time ever Monday, because he had `` a little more fear of the police.'' But he said he did n't think the rules would make much difference. `` It's not going to be worth much, because you ca n't change a population's future from one day to the next with a rule,'' said <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>. `` You need conscience and education about traffic safety.'' At one point on the traffic circle, a pedestrian in a pin-striped suit, ignoring crosswalks, crossed in front of another cop. The 21-year-old salesman said he knew about the new rules and thought they would improve safety if everyone would follow them. But, said <PERSON> Noe </PERSON> <PERSON> Villada </PERSON>, `` To tell the truth, I had n't thought about it.''

 Federal agents today said they seized 871 pounds of cocaine valued at $ 40 million in a truckload of apples and arrested two people. The drugs were concealed in boxes of apples from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state in the back of a 45-foot tractor-trailer, said <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Pedalino </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agent. `` It's probably the most expensive apples that have ever arrived in the state of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Pedalino </PERSON> said the cocaine seized early Monday appears to be from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. He would not give details of the operation but said surveillance led to the truck, which they seized in a parking lot near <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> International Airport. The driver, <PERSON> Sugundino </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a 36-year-old Cuban, was arrested on drug charges. Also arrested was <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceron </PERSON>, 33, a Colombian who authorities said organized the shipment. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> was scheduled for a court appearance later in the day. <PERSON> Ceron </PERSON> was hospitalized in serious condition after jumping from the fourth-floor window of his motel room in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION> as authorities tried to arrest him, <PERSON> Pedalino </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>U.S. Congressmen Complain About New TV Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen on Tuesday complained to European officials that a plan to limit the broadcast of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and other foreign-made TV programs amounted to `` just a plain old trade barrier.'' The legislators, part of an 11-member delegation, wound up a five-day trip with a stop in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to visit the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., said the legislators held a `` spirited exchange'' with officials of the 12-nation trading bloc about the new measure that presses local TV stations to air a majority of European-made entertainment programs `` We feel very strongly about this issue,'' said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, who is the majority leader of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's especially troubling for Americans to see a product that we do have some skill in ... and some advantage to be closed down to any extent,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., said, `` It's a question of access in one of the few areas where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has maintained a positive balance of trade. Another Californian, Republican <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagomarsino </PERSON>, described the move as `` just a plain old trade barrier'' that could lead to `` some fairly severe consequences.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had lobbied strongly against the plan, which was approved last week by foreign ministers of the community nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> argued the move would hurt the European earnings of the American film industry and might violate international trade rules. The plan was part of the community's move to create a single market of 320 million consumers in late 1992. By that date, the dozen nations are scheduled to remove the many trade barriers restricting the free flow of people, money, goods and services. The TV measure spelled out the conditions under which broadcasters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> would be able to transmit channels throughout the community. As part of that, it said governments must ensure that a majority of transmission time be reserved _ `` where practicable and by appropriate means'' _ for European-made programs. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said the community officials explained the measure was `` a goal and not a hard and fast rule.'' The community officials, according to <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, said, `` Even though this is their statement, that it does n't mean in reality it is going to happen.'' Officials said last week the measure was a political commitment, not a legal obligation. <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said American film producers were not asking for a certain share of the European market. `` We're asking for the traditional factors which affect programming decisions, that is, consumer interest, to be the test for what happens in post-Europe'92 television programming,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have argued that the plan amounted to a local content provision, which refers to measures requiring that a certain percentage of a product be produced domestically. The surge in imports of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> TV programs has prompted some European politicians to urge imposition of quotas, contending <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> culture was being threatened.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders, on the defensive as their annual conference opened Tuesday, insisted Thatcherism wo n't slow down despite slumping poll ratings and fears that soaring interest rates will bring on a recession. `` Would the critics prefer us to do too little too late?'' said party chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, addressing 9,000 delegates at the Winter Gardens, a former opera house in this north <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> resort. `` This is not the time for fretting or poring over opinion polls. This is not the time for being fainthearted,'' added <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to applause from Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. She was seated beside him with other party leaders on a podium bedecked in blue, the Tory color, and carrying the slogan of the four-day conference, `` The Right Team for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Future.'' Employment Secretary <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> announced the government will introduce legislation to curb the unions, including a total ban on sympathy strikes and unspecified regulations against wildcat strikes. The conference opened at a time of economic uncertainty, following an increase of interest rates to 15 percent last week, a slump in the value of the pound and inflation of 7 percent. The departure from the conference of Chancellor the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the chief financial official, sparked speculation that yet another interest rate rise was imminent. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had left to work on his speech to the conference, due Thursday. The economic problems have strengthened the revamped <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s four-month lead in poll ratings. The Conservatives are at least seven points behind, their worst rating since a recession in 1981. The proposed new moves against the unions are the latest in a battery of union-curbing laws passed since Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> won power in 1979 and follow a summer resurgence of union militancy. Strikes included weekly shutdown of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway system. The government blamed shadowy groups of militants, although the strikes were official and called after the union arranged secret ballots of members as required by law. `` We have fought to get our industrial relations reforms through,'' said <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>. `` We will not give up now.'' In his keynote speech, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> defended the controversial program Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> is pursuing during the third five-year term she won in 1987. It includes selling the water and electricity utilities to private owners, an unpopular new property tax and a shakeup of the free <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. He was greeted with the repeated applause traditional at the usually well-disciplined <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conferences, which have no policy-making powers and are aimed mainly at rallying support. Outside the conference center, some rank-and-file legislators renewed calls for slowing down, particularly in the privatization and property tax plans, and generally rethinking policies. `` We're getting things wrong at the present time _ we have to say we've made mistakes,'' said legislator Sir <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyson </PERSON>.

 Thousands of sign-waving, chanting demonstrators ringed <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Capitol today as the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> convened the nation's first special session on abortion since a landmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in July. Lawmakers gaveled the session to order shortly after 1 p.m. to take up anti-abortion legislation pushed by Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> in the wake of a high court ruling giving states greater power to restrict abortions. Pro-choice activists marched to the Capitol, with anti-abortion demonstrators lining the route. No trouble was reported, although there was jeering and yelling from both sides. Senate President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, both Democrats, said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s proposals would get a full hearing in committees. But they said the legislation is unlikely to pass. `` I do n't believe a session called to restrict abortion is a wise expenditure of time,'' <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. Uniformed officers have maintained tight security at the Capitol, patrolling corridors and guarding the doors to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chambers. `` You are being heard on this issue,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told a cheering crowd of 7,000 anti-abortion activists in a rally outside the Capitol on Monday night. `` More than 1,000 babies could be saved by pending legislation, whose voices we wo n't hear, whose cries will not be acknowledged,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said as the crowd chanted, `` Pro-life! Pro-life!'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> called the session in July in response to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> vs. Reproductive Health Services. The ruling prompted efforts in several states to impose limits on abortions. Among the governor's proposals are a ban on the use of public money and facilities for abortions and expanded regulation of abortion clinics. Measures intended to make women think twice about having an abortion would require doctors to tell patients about the development of their fetuses and require women more than 20 weeks pregnant to be tested to see if the fetus could survive outside the womb before an abortion is performed. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s anti-abortion movement suffered a setback last week when the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down a 1988 law that required girls under 18 to obtain the consent of a parent or a judge before getting an abortion. The court ruled the law violated a privacy clause in the state Constitution.

 A special hit team of lady beetles and wasps has been imported from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmers battle the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> wheat aphid, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The predator insects are natural enemies of the aphid, and after evaluation may be used in field tests against the destructive pests. In all, three species of wasps and four species of lady beetles were collected during May and June in the southern region of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reported. Actual collecting of the hundreds of specimen was done by insect pathologist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Poprawski </PERSON> and entomoligist <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON>, who work for the agency's parasite laboratory in <LOCATION> Behoust </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. During their explorations, <PERSON> Poprawski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gruber </PERSON> were based at a new Soviet-American biological control laboratory in <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION>. The insects were sent to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, for quarantine, rearing of new generations and distribution. The department's <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Soper </PERSON> said in a statement that the wasps and beetles `` are the first exchanges of biological pest controls to come from recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> research agreements with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Soper </PERSON> coordinates research on biological pest controls for the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, Md. He left on Monday for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help plan next year's joint studies and explorations. The Russian wheat aphid, first spotted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has spread to 16 states in just three years, damaging wheat, barley, rye and oats. Aphids were said to cost farmers an estimated $ 123 million last year in grain losses and chemical controls. Officials said two species of Soviet wasps were sent in August to a <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> research unit in <LOCATION> Stillwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, for evaluation with other wasps from <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> to determine the best candidates for field tests. Some other wasps were shipped to the department's `` mass-rearing facility'' in Mission, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to produce more specimens. And the lady beetles are being `` multiplied'' in <LOCATION> Niles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. Research on the beetles will be done at the agency's facility in Brookings, N.D

<TEXT>
 This country's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders have moved toward political change by discarding the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and creating a new party dedicated to democratic reforms. The Communist Party, officially called the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> when it was reorganized after the 1956 revolution, decided Saturday to become the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and adopted a manifesto pledging to bring democracy to the country. The delegates to the party congress then named <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as president of the new party. With the same leader, a slightly different name and the same membership as the old party, it remains unclear what directions the new organization will take. The Hungarian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was modeled on the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in which the party elite made all the major day-to-day decisions and the general membership had little say in formulating policy. A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> believes in the efficency of central economic planning and all property is state-owned in an effort to end `` exploitation of the working masses.'' One important aspect of communism is that it concerns itself not only with the economy but with almost every aspect of society, including political life, education and public information. However, under the 32-year leadership of <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> party allowed some small private enterprise in the 1970s and was relatively tolerant of dissent. In the past year, the reformist Communist leadership took steps toward transition to a more democratic society by advocating free elections and a market economy. The program of the newly founded <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> makes no mention of Marxism and accepts a market economy that includes private ownership. Socialist parties in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> have favored some state influence in the national economy, stressing it is necessary to ensure public welfare and national health programs, a point also emphasized by the new Hungarian party. The new party also has adopted <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> ideals such as guaranteed human rights and freedom of movement and freedom of conscience. The party's program advocates a `` social market economy,'' rejecting democratic centralism and favoring self-government. It wishes to compete for support among the electorate along with other parties and no longer relies on its leading role in society being secured in the constitution. The party accepts the fact that there is a plurality of interests in society and rejects the notion that there is a single `` correct line'' on everything.

 Security has been tightened for Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, but officials declined Tuesday to directly link the measures to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s crackdown on drug traffickers. `` It was a combination of threats in the area of terrorism, both from domestic concerns and from international areas. Also narco-terrorism was a part of it,'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> said about the increased security for <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. The attorney general has been using an armor-plated limousine, which cost more than $ 100,000, for three or four weeks, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. He also has been using a basement entrance at the department instead of the street-level door he had been using, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Both <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> declined to say whether <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s war on drugs was a specific factor. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> began a crackdown on drug traffickers in mid-August. `` There has been since mid-August a heightened concern for security,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. He would not say whether there had been any specific threats against <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has assigned a permanent security detail to protect <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, said spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>. The security, <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said, was `` not solely because of the Colombian situation, but partly'' the result of it. The <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for protecting federal courthouses, is tightening security in jurisdictions where Colombian drug traffickers face charges. `` We are taking necessary security steps throughout the country, but we are not going into a discussion of degrees of what we are doing specifically, <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> said. One Colombian has been extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on charges of laundering money for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel since the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government began its crackdown. Three other Colombians wanted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges are awaiting extradition.

 A judge granted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> a no-fault divorce that ended his 12-year marriage but not the accusations of unethical conduct his wife leveled during their six-month separation. `` I take it there is no possibility of reconciliation,'' Circuit Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on Monday. `` No,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has accused her former husband of impropriety in arranging a federal job for <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ball </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 56, moved in with the 28-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> last winter, weeks after he recommended her for a $ 28,000-a-year job on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, on which he is the senior Republican. `` I believe congressmen should serve their constituents just as well as they serve their libido,'' <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` It boils down to this: Having a relationship is normal.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up Medical Device Patent Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday agreed to referee a big-money battle over patent rights for medical devices. The court said it will hear an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, seeking reinstatement of a $ 26.7 million award against <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION> infringed on patents on a device implanted in patients to correct potentially fatal heart rhythms. At issue are provisions of a 1984 federal law that reduced patent infringement protection for drug companies. A federal appeals court here interpreted the law to apply to medical devices as well as generic drugs. The appeals court last March threw out the $ 26.7 million judgment a lower court awarded <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>. The 1984 law is aimed at helping generic drug manufacturers seeking to place their substitutes for patented, brand-name drugs on the market as soon as patents expire. The law permits the generic drug firms to get information from the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and apply to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> for approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patents. Also, as long as the purpose is related to its application to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>, the generic drug companies are allowed by law to `` make, use or sell a patented invention'' prior to the patent's expiration. The appeals court here said `` the clear intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was to create an <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> experimental use exception'' for research activities. `` No persuasive reason is suggested why <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would create an exception with respect to those activities for drugs only,'' the appeals court said. <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>, with support from other major medical companies and patent holders, said the ruling could undermine health care research and development of lifesaving devices. The companies said the pace of costly, innovative research will be slowed because patent holders will fear their work soon might be copied. But <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> is distorting economic reality. <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION> said the value of the heart-implant devices it tested is less than $ 415,000. By contrast, it said, <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> is expected to sell more than $ 100 million worth of the devices before a two-year extension of its patent expires on Oct. 26, 1990. `` Notwithstanding the limited nature of <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION>'s FDA-controlled testing, <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON> contended that the testing gave <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION> a headstart towards an entry into the commercial marketplace,'' <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION> said It added that if <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s interpretation of the 1984 law is correct, it is up to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and not the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to correct the problem. <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION> said its new device is intended to treat cardiac disturbances painlessly with low-energy electrical impulses as a substitute for the higher-energy shocks that accompany the Lilly device. <PERSON> Lilly </PERSON>'s appeal to the high court was supported by Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, sponsor of the 1984 legislation, and Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Pa., floor manager of the bill in the House The case is <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Medtronic </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 89-243.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf pvs, `Authorities said ...' to RESTORE that autopsies

<DATELINE>VICTORIA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Four Mexican aliens were found dead this morning in a rail-mounted trailer that had been fumigated with a toxic chemical, police said. The trailer had been plastered with a warning it was being fumigated. `` They apparently died of asphyxiation,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> inspector found the victims about 8:15 a.m. after a brakeman noticed a door open, said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burney </PERSON>. The container, 40 feet long, 8 feet tall and 10 feet wide, was half filled with boxes of tortilla flour. Authorities said they were not certain if fumigation played a role in the deaths, but <PERSON> Burney </PERSON> said the victims had suffered diarrhea and vomiting, symptoms he said can be caused by the fumigant usually used on flour. Autopsies were scheduled. The trailer carried an 8-by-10-inch sticker with skulls and the warning, in Spanish and English: `` Danger. This trailer is being fumigated.'' Officials of the flour producer, <ORGANIZATION> Azteca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Edinburg </LOCATION>, said they did not know exactly when the trailer was treated with pesticide but that the aliens must have broken into the container after it was fumigated. A contractor had fumigated the flour with <PERSON> Phostoxin </PERSON>, an aluminum phosphate pesticide, before the trailer was sealed and loaded on a flatcar in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON>, Azteca quality control manager. `` Obviously they had to break into the car because they are sealed before they are put on the train,'' said <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Azteca </PERSON> traffic manager. Aluminum phosphate can produce a poisonous gas in enclosed containers and should not be breathed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The train left <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION> at 12:40 a.m., said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeyta </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> trainmaster. The morning was cool, with temperatures at <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> in the mid-50s. `` They put a hole in the roof about the size of a half dollar. Apparently one of them had a buckle knife he used to poke the hole,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. Another police officer said the men apparently made the hole for ventilation. <PERSON> Burney </PERSON> said officers suspect other illegal aliens may have been hiding in another trailer and opened the door, then fled when they saw the bodies. The trailer was in between switching areas in <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, a town of 45,000 about 125 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Since 1980, there has been a string of incidents in which illegal aliens have been found dead after crossing into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In 1987, 18 Mexican men suffocated inside a locked boxcar after crossing the border into a freight yard in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>. A smuggler had locked the men inside the insulated car, which later was parked for hours in the desert sun.

<TEXT>
 The international <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Book Fair opened Tuesday with an appeal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders to lift the death threat against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, author of `` The Satanic Verses.'' In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said it is continuing to urge Czechoslovak authorities to grant an exit visa to dissident playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, who is due to receive a prize at the book fair Sunday. But West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> indicated it was not likely <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> would get a visa. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidhaas </PERSON>, director of the 41st annual fair, the largest in the world, said extra security precautions have been taken because several exhibitors expressed concern that the death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> could put them in danger. Luggage deposit boxes in the fair buildings are being kept locked, he said. Among those concerned are exhibitors from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book has been published and drawn protests, <PERSON> Weidhaas </PERSON> said. No threats have yet been received, he added. <PERSON> Weidhaas </PERSON>, who said he was speaking for all the publishers gathered in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, appealed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leadership to `` revoke the death call against <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, his publishers and booksellers.'' Neither German nor foreign publishers are displaying the British author's book, published last year. Some exhibitors feel `` simply uneasy if such a book is around,'' <PERSON> Weidhaas </PERSON> said. In February, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> put a $ 5.2-million bounty on <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, whose `` The Satanic Verses'' was banned in Moslem countries because they said it blasphemed Islam. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who died in June, also urged Moslems to kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s publishers The current Iranian leadership has upheld the death threats. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is banned from the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> fair as long as the threat stands, <PERSON> Weidhaas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a leading human rights activist who is banned from publishing in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, has been awarded the annual Friedenspreis -LRB- Peace Prize -RRB- by West German publishers. A presentation ceremony, which <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> will attend, is scheduled Sunday in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s historic St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s church. `` Today <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> is unfortunately still being prevented from being with us. I hope that the awarding of the West German publishers' Friedenspreis is support and encouragement for him in his distress,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said in officially opening the book fair. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has urged his Czechoslovak counterpart several times to let <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> come accept his prize, ministry officials said. If <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> can not come, West German actor and director <PERSON> Maximilian </PERSON> <PERSON> Schell </PERSON> is due to accept the prize for him. Nearly 8,200 exhibitors are taking part in this year's <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> Book Fair, about 3 percent more than in 1988, organizers said. French literature and culture are the focus of this year's fair. Related events are planned in 23 other West German cities. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON>, a top official in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s book trade association, called for a unified book pricing system in the European Community once the trade bloc removes all internal trade barriers by the end of 1992.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has airlifted to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> some of the leaders of the failed military coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and is treating them as refugees, the White House said today. Presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the group included coup members as well as their relatives. `` We have a number of refugees in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> that were flown in,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't identify who they are or where they are for personal safety reasons.'' He said the action was taken under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s authority. At the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said 42 Panamanians were flown to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and admitted on humanitarian grounds. Some are relatives of Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, a top coup leader killed after the takeover failed, she said. <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, was conspicuously absent Monday from her husband's funeral in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported that those given refuge also included Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON>, believed to be the highest-ranking participant in the coup to escape capture, and Capt. <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, who was arrested and jailed last year for taking part in a failed 1988 plot against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> was said to have been released from jail three weeks ago. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the Panamanians are being received by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> and `` the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is prepared to review aplications for political asylum if such requests are made.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> continued to defend the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role and the decision not to send in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces to help depose <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Amid charges that the administration was operating in a void of information, the spokesman said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` had plenty of information, he made the decision that he thought was best and the decision we still think is right. We do n't have any questioning about the correctness of that decision.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> seemed to back away from administration complaints about congressional interference in foreign affairs, particularly in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Saying that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants a good relationship with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` We do n't have any specific complaints.'' Asked if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was planning additional economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to increase pressure on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We do n't have any plan'' to do that. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said a review of the events during the coup now reveals that there was `` confusion'' and dissension among the coup plotters, and that there was some argument about what to do with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it is now clear that <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, the coup leader, `` had no intention, ever,'' of turning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that an officer who wanted to turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> argued with <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> about it. The spokesman declined to identify the officer or say where he is now. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the officer was one of those who met later with Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, second in command of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the area. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he could not say whether that officer made clear to <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> that there was a dissident faction among the Panamanian officers who wanted to turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said it is n't entirely clear to what extent the people claiming to hold <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> really had him under their control. `` You have someone who was one of the coup plotters, saying, ` Well we ought to -LRB- turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-.' He does n't prevail, and he leaves. And he communicates -LRB- to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- that the people holding General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still have no intention of turning him over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` There was never a request for us to come and get him, they never offered him to us,'' he said.

 Smooth singing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Strait </PERSON>, voted country music's best entertainer, could hardly believe he had won the award after five years in contention. `` Slap me! Pinch me!'' he told a throng of well-wishers Monday night after being presented the honor at the Grand Ole Opry House during the nationally televised Country Music Association awards program. The soft spoken Strait, a top concert draw and one of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s favorite singers, said the accolade capped his career. `` I've worked really hard for eight years,'' said the natty 37-year-old tenor. `` It finally paid off.'' `` The fans could n't be denied,'' he said. `` They have been so great to me. I owe this to them.'' His album, `` Beyond the Blue Neon,'' is No. 8 on the Billboard country music chart this week and still doing well after 33 weeks on the chart. It has already gone gold, selling more than 500,000 copies. Strait's July hit record, `` What's Going On in Your World,'' was his 19th No. 1 song. Despite his steady success this decade, the <ORGANIZATION> CMA </ORGANIZATION>'s top award had eluded him while others like <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reba </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntire </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> earned the honor. `` I was starting to think maybe it would n't happen,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to extend five child nutrition programs for five years and to make it easier for low-income children and pregnant women to qualify. The bill was approved on a voice vote with no opposition. An identical measure is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation expands the women, infants and children prenatal and postnatal nutrition program by $ 150 million _ to slightly more than $ 2 billion _ in 1990 to allow at least 300,000 more mothers and infants to participate. It also makes any expectant mother or infant in a family receiving food stamps, Aid to Families with Dependent Children payments or Medicaid automatically eligible. For the first time, schools would be allowed to certify children as eligible for free lunches by obtaining needed information from local food stamp or AFDC offices without requiring additional applications from their families. Other extended programs include nutrition education and training, free summer lunches to children in needy areas, an expanded school breakfast program and aid to states for administering school lunch programs.

 A moose that apparently lost a mating rights battle in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is wandering south through <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, sending residents scrambling for their cameras and hopping into airplanes for a better look. Moose are n't supposed to be in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, but several have popped up in the last dozen years, usually heading south for a mysterious reason, a state wildlife specialist said Tuesday. The wandering bull's natural range is 400 miles north of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The animal has traveled 120 miles in the state since it was spotted Sept. 22. Word spread quickly when the moose was sighted Monday in <LOCATION> Woodbine </LOCATION>, about 100 miles west of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. Residents grabbed their cameras, and postmaster <PERSON> Dencil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammack </PERSON> rushed to the airport and rented a plane. By the time he got up, the moose had moved to a field of unpicked corn. `` He was kind of tired out and resting,'' <PERSON> Hammack </PERSON> said. `` We came in low and got a good look at him.'' The cornfield's owner, farmer <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, went along with <PERSON> Hammack </PERSON> for the ride. `` He said, ` I do n't suppose the federal crop people would honor a claim for damages by a moose,' `` <PERSON> Hammack </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Gladfelder </PERSON>, a state wildlife specialist, said he expects the moose to continue south, though he does n't know why. `` I only know of one case where a moose did turn back, and that was back in the 70s. The others have either gone on south or stayed the winter,'' he said. <PERSON> Gladfelder </PERSON> said the best theory on the beast's trek is that it lost a contest for mating rights and was rejected by the herd. The animal already has crossed two rivers to keep on the southerly course. State conservation officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said the moose was not bothered by gawkers and airplanes. `` Some got to within 30, 40 feet from him to get their pictures and videos,'' he said.

<HEAD>Provoked Paleontologists Pursue Postal Precision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's paleontologists, who know a dinosaur when they see one, are upset over the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service's latest block of dinosaur stamps. One of the stamps uses an out-of-date name and another actually shows a flying reptile, complain the scientists who study ancient forms of life. In its own defense the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> produced a letter from a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> seven-year-old to whom the identity of the animals was perfectly clear. And as for calling the set `` dinosaur'' stamps, officials say that term is simply the easiest for people to understand. The stamps were selected in an effort to join in the current interest in dinosaurs among young people, and they are being featured as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s annual `` Stamp Collecting Month'' promotion. The four 25-cent stamps include a tyrannosaurus, a large fierce reptile, and a stegosaurus, or plated lizard, with a row of large plates on its back. Neither of those raised any complaints from the paleontologists. But the other two show a brontosaurus, a large-bodied lizard with long neck and tiny head, and a pteranodon, a flying reptile, That means that one of the stamps, the pteranodon, does n't picture a dinosaur at all, complained the paleontologists And the brontosaurus actually is an apatosaurus, they said. While promoting the dinosaur stamps in their advertising, postal officials admit that the pteranodon is n't technically a dinosaur. The Postal Service's book `` Introduction to Stamp Collecting,'' which is being used in the stamp promotion, refers to the stamps as the `` prehistoric animals series'' and notes that the group of stamps portrays `` three dinosaurs and a pteranodon, a winged creature that ruled the skies while dinosaurs ruled the land.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Paleontological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is more upset about the brontosaurus stamp, however, having gone so far as to issue a statement detailing the correct name for the animal. The brontosaurus never existed, having actually been the result of a 19th century researcher mixing up the skull of one prehistoric animal with the body bones of another, the paleontologists say. The body skeleton had already been named apatosaurus, the scientists noted. In the past 15 years or so museums have corrected the problem, joined the correct skulls with the skeletons of the animals, and changed the designation to apatosaurus. By scientific convention, the paleontologists state, `` when more than one name is given to a species only the oldest name is scientifically valid. As a consequence, use of the name brontosaurus must be discontinued.'' In its defense, the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> noted that its booklet on stamps uses both names, and the agency produced a letter from 7-year-old <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who had read about the controversy in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> newspaper. `` I like the name brontosaurus because it means thunder lizard, not deceptive lizard like apatosaurus,'' wrote <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON>. After citing a several books using the term brontosaurus, he concluded that `` it's all right to use brontosaurus because most kids, including my sister, know that brontosaurus and apatosaurus are the same creature.''

 Fifth-grader <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s pet walks on a leash, jumps through a hoop, plays dead, wears a helmet and rides a scooter. The pet is a lizard. It's a simple garden variety, called an anole lizard, that skitters on sidewalks and leaps between blades of grass. It showed up one day at <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s front door in this farming community 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. `` I almost stepped on him,'' the youngster said. `` Then he ran in the house.'' The 11-year-old named his pet Figment, after a Disney World character and patiently taught the lizard tricks to show off at school. The lizard taught the shy boy, whose family moved 14 times, to make friends. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> had a feeling his new pet was special when it sat in <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s hand for long periods The youngster began working with him. First, there were hoops. Figment effortlessly jumps through <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s mother's bracelet with a gentle nudge. The easiest trick is playing dead. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> flips the lizard on its back and rubs the reptile's smooth, beige tummy. Claws in the air, eyes closed, Figment almost looks as though he's smiling. But getting a leash and helmet on the squirming creature took more doing. `` Figment,'' the youth admonished during a training session. `` Keep your hat on!'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> slipped a small collar fashioned from a rubber band past the lizard's snout, then carefully placed Figment on a tiny doll scooter. He plopped on the helmet and gently pushed the lizard around. <PERSON> Lex </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, curator of the <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoo </PERSON>, said he's never heard of anyone training a lizard. `` This must be a special lizard,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemanski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>'s math teacher `` I do n't think all lizards can do what he does.

 A man whose 8-year-old granddaughter shot herself in the thumb may be the first person charged under <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s precedent-setting gun-access law, authorities said Tuesday. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 61, was charged Sunday with violating the law designed to keep loaded guns out of the hands of children. The law went into effect Oct. 1. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> shot herself Sunday at Green's home, less than two miles from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> where the law was passed during a special legislative session in June. `` It's an indication the law was needed and it will be enforced,'' said state Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>, one of the sponsors. <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> took a .32 - caliber automatic from an unlocked box on a bedroom floor, officials `` To our knowledge, this is the first case where charges have been filed in the state of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Leon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A second test of the law may come out of <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION>, where a 12-year-old was fatally wounded Sunday by a 9-year-old playmate. Under the law, if a child shoots someone, even accidentally, because a gun owner was careless, the adult could be charged with a felony, punishable by up to five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. A gun owner faces a misdemeanor charge and up to 60 days in jail and a $ 500 fine if a minor points a gun at someone or displays it in public. The shot fired by <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s granddaughter passed through her thumb, a bedroom door, a bookcase and onto the floor of the living room, where several family members were gathered, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. The child was treated at <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and released. `` We're glad she only shot her thumb,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> said. `` She could have been killed or killed someone else.'' In the <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION> case, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION>, was shot in the abdomen Sunday when a 9-year-old playmate pulled the trigger on a .22 - caliber rifle, police <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> later died at a hospital in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. The names of the 9-year-old and his parents were being withheld pending a decision on the charges, state attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. The boys had been playing in the 9-year-old's bedroom when he took the rifle down from a rack to show it to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, said Capt. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Schauland </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's department. `` He thought the rifle was empty,'' <PERSON> Schauland </PERSON> said. The law requires gun owners to take reasonable precautions, such as using a trigger lock or keeping the weapon in a locked box, to keep loaded weapons in their homes and businesses out of the hands of children 15 and younger. There are exceptions for hunting and target-shooting accidents and for incidents involving guns taken illegally.

The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has entered the case, agent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyllie </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` There's a strong possibility that a civil rights violation has occurred,'' he said, refusing further comment. The harassment that <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ekaterina </PERSON> <PERSON> Doroshkevich </PERSON> and their children have suffered since Saturday is the first aimed at any of the more than 10,000 Soviet Christians who have immigrated to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1988, <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> says. Police say they have no idea who is responsible for the incidents. `` We're following up on a number of leads and doing anything we can,'' said Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON>, adding that measures have been taken to protect the family. `` They suffered greatly under the Communist system. Now, they're suffering here,'' <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON> said Monday But <PERSON> Doroshkevich </PERSON>, 30, who spent 12 years trying to leave his homeland in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> before arriving in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> with his family Aug. 18, said through an interpreter Monday that he was n't too concerned about the incidents and resolved to stay in this well-to-do Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> `` Where I come from, I'm used to this kind of persecution,'' he said. `` But this is nothing compared with the love we've received here.'' The <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> is one of several Soviet republics chafing under Russian rule from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The harassment began with a telephone call late Saturday from an adult male to the home of the Rev. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the family's resettlement Although the Doroshkevishes are Ukrainian, the caller made vulgar references to Russians, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. No threats were made in that call. About 2 -LCB- hours later, early Sunday, the same man called again and this time threatened the Smiths, the Doroshkeviches and the church, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> called police, who told him that they were responding to a cross-burning at the same time on the front lawn of the Doroshkevich home near the church. Officers put out the fire, but no suspects were spotted, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Later Sunday morning, graffiti was found at the church, some of it painted inside the lobby, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The vandals may have gotten in through an unlocked side door, he said. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the slogans, painted in red, included: `` CCCP not welcome'' _ referring to <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> in the Cyrilic alphabet used in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> _ and `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is for Americans only. Our boys died over there so these people could live here? No way.'' Another said: `` Russians go home ... not welcome in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> ever! Enemy for all time.'' On Sunday night the air was let out of the tires of the Doroshkeviches' car. Two more calls came to <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s home Monday. `` There was no talking, just music,'' he said. `` On one of them they were playing ` We've Only Just Begun.''' <PERSON> Doroschkevich </PERSON>, an auto body welder, said he was subjected to beatings and interrogations in his homeland because of his Pentecostal faith, which is not among the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s authorized religions. Residents of this community of about 23,000 north of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> have responded with support for the family by calling police with leads, <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said. `` The community's reaction has been very favorable, very supportive of this family after this has happened,'' he said. `` I've been a cop for over 15 years and this is the first incident I can recall where we've had anything of this type happen.''

 Operators of a game booth at the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> have stopped handing out live ducklings as prizes after complaints that one was dropped from a Ferris wheel and another was drowned in a cup of beer. `` Rather than alienate anybody or our customers we just decided to stop it,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>, operator of the fair's midway. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pulaski </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's detective, filed a complaint with the city human society after playing the `` Ring-a-Duck'' game. `` I was just totally appalled that they were doing something like this,'' she said. `` They were giving them away like they were toys. They're not toys, they're animals.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, marketing director for <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>, said he had reports of a duckling tossed from the Ferris wheel and another drowned in a cup of beer. `` Basically that was sufficient for us to feel there was valid concern out there,'' <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an animal abuse investigator for the humane society, said he also took complaints but had no proof of cruelty. The owner of the Ring-a-Duck booth began Monday doling out stuffed bears. To win, a player tosses a ring around the neck of hunting decoys floating in a shallow tub. The fair opened Friday.

<TEXT>
 A three-eyed alien with a robot sidekick landed by UFO and made a boy vanish by zapping him with a pistol, a Soviet newspaper reported Tuesday, in a second day of strange tales in the state-run media. But as the bizarre saga of the space invasion of the city of <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> unfolded for a second day, a scientist whose words were used to buttress the first published report voiced doubts, and said he was in part misquoted. `` Do n't believe all you hear from <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Genrikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Voronezh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geophysical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>. `` We never gave them part of what they published.'' On Monday, the usually staid, official Soviet news agency told the world that scientists had confirmed an alien spaceship carrying giant people with tiny heads had touched down in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>, a city of more than 800,000 people about 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. As many as three aliens 13 feet tall left the spacecraft, described as a large shining ball, and walked in the park with a small robot, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. A <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> duty officer stood by the story. `` It is not April Fool's today,'' he said. The purported close encounter in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> was only the latest weird tale to appear in the Soviet media, which under the policy of `` glasnost'' or openness have recently told of other sightings of UFOs and the Yeti, or abominable snowman. Monday's report spawned rumors in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, including one that the aliens told <ORGANIZATION> Voronezh </ORGANIZATION> residents the Earth would be destroyed by the year 2000 if people did n't stop polluting it. Nonetheless, a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> paper whose avowed mission is to write about culture was the only major national daily to print anything Tuesday about the UFO, indicating more authoritative newspapers like Pravda thought the topic too hot to handle. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION> said its coverage was motivated by `` the golden rule of journalism: the reader must know everything.'' `` Of course, it's hard to believe in what happened in the town,'' it reported from <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>. `` It's even more difficult to explain.'' The daily quoted witnesses as saying the UFO flew into <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> on Sept 27. At 6:30 p.m., it said, boys playing soccer saw a pink glow in the sky, then saw a deep red ball about 10 yards in diameter. The ball circled, vanished, then reappeared minutes later and hovered, it said. A crowd rushed to the site, <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION> said, and through an open hatch saw a `` three-eyed alien'' about 10 feet tall, clad in silvery overalls and bronze-colored boots, and wearing a disk on his chest. The newspaper, quoting witnesses, gave this account: The UFO landed. Two creatures, one apparently a robot, exited. A boy screamed with fear, but when the alien gazed at him, with eyes shining, he fell silent, unable to move. Onlookers screamed, and the UFO and the creatures disappeared. About five minutes later, they reappeared. The alien had a `` pistol'' _ a tube about 20 inches long, which it pointed at an unidentified 16-year-old boy, making him disappear. The alien went inside the sphere, which took off. At the same time, the boy reappeared. `` Children and eyewitnesses of the abnormal phenomenon have been questioned by police workers and journalists,'' wrote <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kultura </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> correspondent, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Efremov </PERSON>. `` There are no discrepencies in the description of the sphere itself, or the actions of the ` aliens.' Moreover, all the children who became witnesses to this event are still afraid, even now.'' It gave the names of only three witnesses, all youngsters. Scientists from a nationwide group that investigates `` abnormal phenomena'' were looking into the landing, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON>, who said he belongs to the group, cast doubt on the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> report that quoted him as saying the aliens left behind two rocks resembling sandstone of a deep red color that can not be found anywhere. `` The rock they described as extraterrestrial is in fact a piece of iron oxide which could easily have originated on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' according to <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON>, 50. He said there indeed was `` a landing site'' or something resembling one in <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION>. But he acknowledged that could happen as well if there were an underground pipe or cable, or an underground reservoir. <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON> also said the testimony of children between the ages of 11 and 14 who claimed they witnessed the landing did not always correspond on how the aliens looked, and that they `` certainly did n't mention the tremendous height'' cited by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. The phone connection was abruptly cut off before <PERSON> Silanov </PERSON> could answer more questions. Meanwhile, a <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> editor said two Moscow-based reporters had been dispatched to <LOCATION> Voronezh </LOCATION> to check on the report on the UFO filed by local <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebedev </PERSON>, a man he termed a `` very serious'' journalist. The editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, through bitter experience, has learned to be wary of hoaxes. In January, the news agency reported six people had been rescued after spending 35 days buried alive in rubble following the Armenian earthquake. It later retracted the story.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined the celebration Tuesday for the <LOCATION> Trumbull </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, Little League baseball team that brought the world championship back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former Little League coach, used the Rose Garden ceremony to urge the 12-year-olds to emulate the example of baseball great <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service recently issued a stamp commemorating the 50th anniversary of <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s final season, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presented the original painting of <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON> to an official of the Baseball Hall of Fame in <LOCATION> Cooperstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the Trumbull team, which defeated a favored <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> team at the Little League World Series in <LOCATION> Williamsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, in August, displayed `` a spirit which says that nothing is impossible, in Little League or in the bigger fields of life.'' <PERSON> Trumbull </PERSON> became the first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> squad to capture the title in six years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the youngsters had learned `` the lessons of Little League: lessons like friendship and generosity; like do-unto-others and doing your best; lessons which go beyond balls and strikes and which have made <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> a global institution.'' Little League baseball, which marked its 50th anniversary this year, is played by 2 -LCB- million youths in 33 nations, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>, a Hall of Fame first baseman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> in the 1920s and 1930s, `` a hero of mine.'' <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON> set a consecutive games record that still stands. The streak ended when <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON> was struck by the paralyzing disease that bears his name. Even in the face of that fatal ailment, <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON> told a crowd at his retirement in Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939, `` I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.'' `` That story has become an American parable. What an example for these kids,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON> spent much of the last two years of his life counseling youngsters as parole commissioner for the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` He showed, like <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, that what matters is how we conduct ourselves off, as well as on, the field,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shook hands with Coach <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Galla </PERSON> and his entire squad. `` You truly are No. 1,'' the president said. The Trumbull team has been invited to appear in uniform Sunday at the second game of the World Series between <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, if parents can afford the trip. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had hoped to see the Series himself, apparently has decided the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> is too far to go to throw out a ball. `` I'm afraid I might not get to go now,'' he told reporters as he left the Rose Garden.

<TEXT>
 A man who wooed women by claiming he was a friend of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, rescued hundreds of prisoners of war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and twice won the Medal of Honor was sentenced Tuesday to 15 months of psychiatric treatment. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, 35, has `` a history of falsehoods that ca n't be substantiated other than through his words,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. He ordered <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> to undergo treatment at a federal medical center for prisoners in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. The water purification salesman from Mission, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty in July to falsely impersonating a federal officer. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, who also wove tales of being the nation's youngest major general and of his <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> work, additionally was fined $ 500 and placed on probation for one year. He faced up to three years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines. During the hearing, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstle </PERSON>, described his client as `` an individual who has severe problems and enormous emotional problems.'' `` This has been a long, trying five months for ... my family, my friends,'' <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> said. `` I'm sorry for this episode and the entire train of events.'' After the sentencing, three women stood in the courthouse comparing stories that <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> had told them. Authorities said <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> showed friends copies of a newsletter called the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> with a cover picture of him in an Army shirt with general's stars on the epaulets. The newsletter, dated August 1988, claimed to be a special edition tribute to `` <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s well-known, best-kept secrets.'' In the newsletter and in tales he told women, <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> claimed to have rescued hundreds of prisoners of war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, posed as a priest and a doctor during <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operations, and said he was a friend of Presley. <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> told one woman he was an Army general working for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and needed $ 1,000 to get out of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. The woman gave him a check Jan. 31, but <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> has since repaid the money, a prosecutor said. The government said <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> did serve in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and was given an honorable discharge as a private. A former girlfriend, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>, said she became suspicious of <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> when a neighbor saw <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>' resume and doubted many of his claims. The neighbor called <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where authorities said they had never heard of <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON> said she believed <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> got a relatively light sentence. `` I do n't feel it's fair in light of what he is,'' she said. `` He is a pathological liar who does n't know the truth. He needs to learn to keep his story straight.'' <PERSON> Gerstle </PERSON> said he was satisfied. `` It's not a matter of what's fair The judge sentenced at the lowest end'' of the recommendations, <PERSON> Gerstle </PERSON> said. `` I've never had a case like this before and I doubt I ever will again,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>.

 Riot police fought Tuesday with 1,000 protesters who demanded freedom for political prisoners and tried to reach a nearby National Day rally sponsored by the government. About 2,000 police with clubs and shields formed human walls to keep the protesters, brandishing flag poles and sticks, from the rally outside the presidential office building. Police also used water cannons and barbed-wire barricades. Seven people were reported injured, including five policemen. After the street battle, about 10,000 demonstrators massed outside a jail to demand the immediate release of dissident publisher <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-Liang </PERSON>. The 90-minute parade of military honor guards and marching and dancing students was not interrupted. An estimated 250,000 spectators filled the square in front of the office building. President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON> delivered a brief address to the rally, attended by dignitaries of 40 countries. `` <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s future can not be viewed as independent of a reunified <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Our sense of national righteousness and sincerity will most certainly not allow us to merely stand by and watch <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> continue to exist with one part living in a state of freedom and the other under enslavement.'' The Nationalists, who fled the Chinese mainland when the communists won the civil war in 1949, have suffered diplomatic setbacks because of their claim to be the sole legitimate government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wan-chen </PERSON>, a protest organizer, said the demonstrators from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wanted to appeal to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> to release three prominent political prisoners, including <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON>. About 10,000 riot police blocked all three intersections leading to the jail where the 48-year-old publisher is held. Protesters wore yellow headbands, carried yellow flowers and waved banners reading `` Release <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsin-liang </PERSON> was arrested after his return from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month, pending sedition charges. The other two were convicted of sedition and sentenced in 1987 to long jail terms. All are accused of advocating that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> no longer consider itself part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. National Day marks the 1911 uprising in <LOCATION> Wuhan </LOCATION>, central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, that led to the fall of the Manchu Ching dynasty.

 President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said today that seven <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders will soon be freed but that <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is not among them. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said the formalities may take some time, but all the men had served many years and were quite old. The guerrilla leaders were among eight prisoners the government said would soon be released. Seven were <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders and six, like <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, were sentenced to life in prison in 1964. The announcement, read on government-run television, said that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s own release `` is not now on the agenda.'' The most prominent of the prisoners to be released is <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 77, who ran day-to-day operations of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as its secretary-general from 1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> was imprisoned for life in June 1964 along with the other leaders of the guerrilla group's internal military wing. The others to be freed are <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathrada </PERSON>, 60; <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlangeni </PERSON>, 63; <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Motsoaledi </PERSON>, 65; and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, 69. <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkwayi </PERSON>, 66, who briefly took command of the guerrilla group's military wing after the arrest of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s co-defendants in July 1963, is also to be freed from the life prison term he received in 1964. The announcement also named <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, 80, an <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader who has spent most of a five-year prison term in the hospital. He was due for release next year. No information was immediately available about the eighth man to be freed. The television announcement gave his name as <PERSON> Jafta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemula </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most prominent anti-apartheid activist, has been in prison since 1962. In 1962, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was sentenced to five years for leaving the country illegally and organizing an illegal strike by blacks. While serving that sentence he was convicted in 1964 of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government and sentenced to life in prison. Rumors of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s possible release have been circulating in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for more than a decade. In 1988 the government moved him to a suburban-style ranch house on a prison farm. He has refused offers of freedom on condition he renounces the use of violence in the fight to topple the white-led government.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal health officials on Tuesday began distributing a 15-minute videotape advising people infected with the AIDS virus to be especially careful about the foods they eat and how they prepare those foods. Because their immune systems are weakened, people with AIDS and earlier stages of the disease face special dangers from food-borne illnesses that can result from improperly cooked and handled foods, the videotape says. These people can develop life-threatening illnesses from foods such as raw or lightly cooked eggs, meats and seafoods, as well as unwashed produce or food prepared in an unsanitary manner, officials said. The videotape, being sent to community health organizations nationwide, provides information on foods to be avoided and instruction on how best to handle and prepare foods. It also offers advice on how to minimize risks from food-borne infections when dining out and during travel abroad. The virus that causes AIDS can not be transmitted through foods. The videotape was produced by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> and is being distributed through <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s National AIDS Information Clearinghouse. Copies can be requested by contacting the clearinghouse at 1-800-458-5231.

<TEXT>
 A high school was shaken by a second bomb blast in two days Tuesday, and telephoned bomb threats have been received by at least four other high schools in central <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. Tuesday's blast caused minor damage at <ORGANIZATION> Anderson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> but no injuries. Classes were canceled. Police have no suspects, but at least one lead looked promising, said spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. Police Chief <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rheam </PERSON> said police would step up security at the school Wednesday. He declined to reveal details. `` I do not fear for any teacher or student coming to the school tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Rheam </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` The safety of students and teachers is our first priority.'' A small pipe bomb exploded about 7:35 a.m. Tuesday in a hall outside the school auditorium, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> agents were on their way to <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> to investigate Monday's explosion when the second bomb went off, <PERSON> Rheam </PERSON> said `` It sounded like a loud firecracker. I was scared a little bit,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, a senior, who said he was about 40 yards from the explosion. `` The areas that the bombs were placed are areas where there is not heavy traffic flow, so that the person that's placing the bombs has some feeling that he does not want anyone hurt,'' <PERSON> Rheam </PERSON> said. A telephone threat preceded Tuesday's blast by about 10 minutes. A few students and teachers were in the building at the time but no one was injured. Monday's explosion at the school was followed by two telephone bomb threats, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. Highland and Madison Heights high schools in <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also received bomb threats Monday. On Tuesday, officials at <ORGANIZATION> Frankton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, about eight miles northwest of <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, evacuated about 720 students after receiving a bomb threat, said <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, assistant principal. No bomb was found. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said students returned to classes about noon but some were sent home at their parents' request. `` Once you have a bomb threat, you have a certain amount of hysteria and uncertainty, and it makes it very difficult to get the school back to a normal day,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Noblesville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, about 15 miles west of <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION>, also was evacuated Tuesday after officials there received a bomb threat. No bomb was found. <LOCATION> Noblesville </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Reveal </PERSON> suspected it was a copycat incident following publicity surrounding the Anderson bombs. `` I think it's just somebody who thought they could get out of class a half a day or a period,'' Reveal said. Authorities do n't know if the two explosions were related to each other or to the threats, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said. The device that exploded Monday was between a heater and the ceiling in a wrestling room, officials said. Several ceiling tiles were burned and some paint was peeled by the heat, but damage from that blast was limited to about $ 500, said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION> police. Tuesday's blast did about $ 300 damage, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A rocket hit a crowded bus station in the besieged <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> capital Tuesday, killing 23 people and injuring an undetermined number, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kabul </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, described a grisly scene of blood, fragmented bodies and people crying. It said five surface-to-surface rockets hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the eve of the Afghan celebration of the birth of the Moslem prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> 1,409 years ago. `` People, including children, women and old men, were returning home from work or shopping'' when the rocket exploded, the radio said. It said the rocket was fired `` most probably'' by puritan Wahabi sect mercenaries helping U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas fighting to topple <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government. The celebration of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s birth depends each year on the sighting of the moon. Afghans will celebrate the event Wednesday but other Moslem countries may celebrate later this week. Afghan guerrillas, who are struggling to oust the communists and establish an Islamic government, also are aided in part by private Moslem mercenaries from some gulf states. Official <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> media often report that these mercenaries, in addition to Pakistanis and sometimes even Americans, are fighting against them on Afghan soil. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has flatly denied that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel ever have fought in the 11-year-old Afghan civil war. Also on Tuesday, Western diplomatic sources in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said an estimated 2 million people in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> face a winter of scarce food and fuel unless the communist government changes its priority of supplies. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bulk of a massive Soviet airlift to the city consists of weapons instead of foodstuff. Western diplomats reported a similar situation in autumn 1988. When early and persistent snows fell in the winter, disrupting overland transport, <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> faced a severe food shortage. Soviet combat troops ended nine years of involvement in the Afghan civil war in February, and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government forces still hold the major cities. But the guerrillas, fighting to oust the communists in favor of an Islamic system of goverment, control most of the rugged countryside including key roads. Several of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s communist-controlled cities only receive supplies by air, which sharply limits the volume of cargo.

<TEXT>
 A meat trade official said in a report Tuesday that the current situation points to good times for the industry as the 1990s approach. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Manly </PERSON> <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the overall decline in red meat consumption appears to have stabilized over the last year or so. Further, he said, there are `` solid indications'' that demand for pork is increasing. `` Retail beef prices have responded to supply shortfalls with more vigor than might have been expected after the flat-to-down trend that characterized most of the decade -LRB- of the 1980s -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said. `` And the export value of meat and meat products surpassed the value of imports for the first time ever last year.'' <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>' comments were in the association's Meat Facts yearbook for 1989, the 19th annual issue. `` Cattle numbers are at or near their cyclical low, and beef supplies will remain tight for the next several years as producers hold back cattle to expand herd sizes,'' he said. `` On the pork side, poor producer returns have likely slowed herd expansion, with the result that pork supplies could be slightly smaller next year.''

<HEAD>State Enterprises Have Big Overdue Power Bills, Shortage Looms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state electric industry, owed more than $ 39 million, is telling government-owned enterprises to pay up or it will pull the plug. The power monopoly also warns of a potential shortage of electrical energy due to lack of capacity as the winter heating season approaches, the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. Amid <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s crumbling economy, there have been reports of state-owned companies failing to pay other state-owned enterprises. This results in enterprises lacking cash to operate, further aggravating shortages and reducing funds available to pay debts to other suppliers. Among the debtors with overdue electric bills in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> are the pharmaceutical enterprise, the car factory and the works that make construction and photographic supplies and transportation, optical, telecommunications equipment, according to <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. The Polfa pharmaceutical enterprise alone owes nearly $ 139,000. The largest debtor, the Huta Warszawa steel mill, recently paid up, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said, although no figure was provided for its bill. Regional power distribution stations already have cut off electricity to many smaller enterprises with high bills, the news agency said. The power supplier warned that even companies that pay their bills may suffer power shortages due to a demand for electricity that has increased by 1,000 megawatts. `` This is precisely the amount lacking at present,'' said <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. `` Almost all the capacity of the Polish power industry has been put ot use.'' Last month, a severe shortage of coal was reported. Estimates are that coal extraction this year will be off 7 million tons from the approximately 185 million tons mined last year.

 In a state that has no limits on political contributions, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s campaign for governor of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> is happy to have the support of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, named by <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> as the richest man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` It's great,'' <PERSON> B.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Northington </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> campaign aide, said Tuesday. `` He's given us, what, $ 200,000?'' Indeed, he has, in two checks so far this year of $ 100,000 each. <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> raised an additional $ 500,000 for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> at a $ 5,000-a-couple get together at his <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION> estate. But <PERSON> Northington </PERSON> was quick to say that <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>'s Republican opponent, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, has received more than $ 900,000 in campaign contributions from <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, developer <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Schar </PERSON> and his family. Big money is a hallmark of the campaign to succeed <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Democratic Gov <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>, who can not run for re-election. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> has raised more than $ 8 million and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON>, bidding to become the first black elected governor of any state, has taken in close to $ 5 million. The election is Nov. 7. Money can be easy to raise in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, too easy, according to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, a political scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have no limitations in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` People can give millions if they want.'' <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> defends political action committees as a preferred alternative to individual contributions in the range of hundreds of thousands of dollars. `` They're making an investment,'' he said of such contributors. `` I've yet to find a person who believes the line they're doing it for good government.'' <PERSON> Alson </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> who is one of the state's premier political fund-raisers, said he supported efforts to limit individual contributions to $ 1,000. `` We could n't get that to fly,'' he said, adding that attempts to set the limit at $ 5,000 and $ 10,000 were no more successful. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> described <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> as `` a good friend of mine'' and said, `` I've never asked him for a dime for anybody.'' He said he thought <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> was `` basically a Republican.'' The 75-year-old <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> is described as a self-made man who parlayed a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> radio station into the <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> radio and television empire. Forbes estimated his fortune at $ 5.2 billion and said his holdings rose about $ 2 billion from the previous year thanks to a tripling in the value of his investment in cellular telephones. He took the role of richest man in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> stores discount chain who dropped down on the individual list because he divided his $ 9 billion fortune among himself and his four children. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> met when the billionaire had `` a little mixer'' on his yacht. `` He started off without a dime,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>. `` He felt <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> had brought himself up by his bootstraps.'' That prompted the first $ 100,000 check from <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> to the <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> campaign. The story of the second check was told by <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> at the fund-raising reception at their estate. According to Mrs. <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>, <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> called her husband and said he was aware of his support for <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> but `` I'm going to win and I think we should get to know each other.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> said that after that conversation her husband wrote another $ 100,000 check to the <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> campaign. What would <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>'s money buy if <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> is elected governor? There has been widespread speculation that the billionaire's wife yearns to sit on the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> brushed off such suggestions, saying that given <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>'s wealth, `` There's nothing <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilder </PERSON> can do for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON> What can anybody do for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluge </PERSON>?''

<HEAD>Nuns Win Reprieve for Their Chickens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> nuns won a reprieve Tuesday for their flock of egg-laying chickens, which had been marked for slaughter by health inspectors. Lawyers for 14 nuns at Our Lady of Passion Monastery in the central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Daventry </LOCATION> appealed to the High Court for a review of a <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> order permitting inspectors to destroy the nuns' 5,000 chickens. Judge Sir <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiemann </PERSON> said he would review the slaughter order at a hearing Friday. The nuns accused Minister of Agriculture <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gummer </PERSON> of `` failing to comply with the rules of natural justice.'' The chickens were targeted for slaughter after a salmonella victim in nearby <LOCATION> Bedworth </LOCATION> blamed their eggs for her food poisoning. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, head of the autonomous order, said the monastery's eggs had never been tested. Mother <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> said the strain of salmonella _ typhimurium _ has been in the convent's chickens since 1913 and did not pose a serious health risk. She said the Bedworth outbreak had been caused by another strain, enteriditus. The nuns last week blocked roads leading to the convent and barricaded themselves in the henhouse to keep out health inspectors and ministry officials. They said the convent might have to close if the income from selling eggs was lost. The government authorized its veterinarians to close egg-producing plants and slaughter chickens after a food poisoning scare earlier this year involving salmonella in eggs. The British <ORGANIZATION> Egg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said they were delighted the judicial review had been granted and said it would be a test case which could force the government to rethink its approach to tackling salmonella contamination.

 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> asked Latin American nations on Tuesday to take `` strong collective action'' against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who survived another coup attempt last week in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> there is no longer a constitutional regime, but a simple military dictatorship ... engaging in dramatic excesses,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told a news conference. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> commands <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and so controls the government there. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> accused that government of executing rebel officers imprisoned after the coup failed. The government denied news accounts of some coup leaders being executed after surendering, but <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said he had reports that, `` with a great deal of precision ... officers of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> have been executed while in prison.'' He gave no details nor did he spell out what action <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should take. At the funeral in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Tuesday of a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> captain involved in the coup, his widow said her husband was killed in prison and did not commit suicide as rumors had it. Capt. <PERSON> Nicasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was reported to have committed suicide in prison by hanging himself. The official coroner's report said he died of asphyxiation. But his widow, <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was `` a very <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> man'' who would never have killed himself and vowed at her husband's coffin, `` I will shout it to the world until justice is done and the truth is known.'' Panamanian military officials have said eight officers and two sergeants were killed in the rebellion Oct. 3, including its leader, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>. Several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reports have said an enraged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> personally shot <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> to death minutes after the coup failed. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had flown some coup leaders to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, along with members of their families. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out for nearly two years. It applied economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him in February 1988 on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> claims all efforts to oust him are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to retain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> after 1999, when it is to be turned over under treaties signed in 1977. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> led the agenda for talks between <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, who arrived Monday for a 48-hour official visit. On Monday night, at a banquet for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime was `` sowing terror -LRB- by -RRB- executing Panamanian officers.'' At the news conference Tuesday, he ruled out military intervention, saying it `` would be a tragedy for the whole continent.'' He added that Latin American action undertaken `` in solidarity with the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people'' would spare the region worse evils. The president declared that <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was allowing a military dictatorship in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> despite its repudiation of attempts to overthrow civilian governments in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> by force. That, he said, `` could be a dangerous sign of regression for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s democratic process. It compels us to see ... a dictorship in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as a threat for the entire continent.'' Observers said the call for joint action could lead to formal expulsion of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eight </ORGANIZATION>, whose other members are <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> was suspended early in 1988 after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> arranged the dismissal of President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, who had tried to fire the general as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> commander. The Group of Eight, formed three years ago to represent <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on major political and economic issues, is to hold a two-day summit this week at <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said other members share his concern about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Because of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s strategic position, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, the crisis there has `` global implications'' and is <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most serious problem. He said the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime `` lacks legality and legitimacy'' and the coup attempt demonstrates `` that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>' unity is broken.'' Since the coup, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` has unleashed an increasing repression whose extent we can not determine.''

<TEXT>
 The judge in the case of a jogger who was raped and nearly beaten to death in Central Park issued a gag order Tuesday at a hearing on whether the teen-age defendants' statements may be used as trial evidence. Six young men are charged with the April 19 rape and attempted murder of a 28-year-old investment banker who was taking her nightly jog in the park. She suffered severe brain damage and still has partial amnesia, but is undergoing rehabilitation and has offered to testify. At the request of the prosecution, state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Galligan </PERSON> ordered lawyers in the case not to divulge any material brought out at the hearing that prosecutors intend to use as evidence. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederer </PERSON>, complaining about leaks to the news media, told <PERSON> Galligan </PERSON> the material contained the names of juveniles and other witnesses she plans to call, as well as other information which could compromise the investigation if revealed. A seventh teen is charged with attacking two male joggers and robbing them. He is not charged with rape. An eighth youth, <PERSON> Jermaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 15, has pleaded guilty to robbery in connection with attacks on the male runners and is expected to testify against the others in exchange for a one-year sentence and youthful offender status. The pretrial hearing is on whether to suppress written and videotaped statements to police in which most of the youths implicate their codefendants. The defense lawyers say the statements were taken illegally from children under duress and should be thrown out. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, lawyer for defendant <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Santana </PERSON>, said his client was browbeaten for 10 hours before he was allowed to see his parents. Then he was told he would be allowed to go if he confessed, the lawyer said. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, lawyer for Kharey Wise, 17, said police kept his client away from parents, counsel and food for hours before extracting a statement. Outside the courtroom, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said that if <PERSON> Galligan </PERSON> bars the youths' statements to police, his client will go free. `` The videotaped statements are the whole case,'' <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said. `` Without them they have no case. I feel pretty confident that if the law is followed, the statements will not be admitted.'' If <PERSON> Galligan </PERSON> admits the statements as evidence, some of the youths may have to get separate trials, partly because their interests are antagonistic.

<TEXT>
 Candidates for new school-based councils that will give parents unprecedented power to shape public education rang doorbells and passed out leaflets Tuesday in a last-minute effort to get voters to the polls. Elections on Wednesday at the city's 469 elementary schools and Thursday at the 71 public high schools will determine council members, whose sweeping authority will include hiring and firing principals, developing school-improvement plans and spending money. Each council will include six parents, two teachers and two community residents without schoolchildren. School staffs will elect teacher members. The 11th member of each council will be the principal of the school or schools the council oversees. Community activists and others who spent weeks trying to mobilize residents to participate in the 590 councils persuaded 17,256 candidates to run for nearly 5,000 unpaid council spots. The activists predicted a 50 percent turnout for the elections among parents with children in the schools, urging voters without children to participate as well in one of the most radical reforms in big-city education this century. `` The basic message is that the city ca n't survive with the quality of schools that we have,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, executive director of Designs for Change, an education research and advisory group that helped shape an education reform package. The local councils are a key element of the reform plan, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> last year. The reform effort is aimed at lowering the city's estimated 40 percent dropout rate, improving dismal test scores, weeding out unmotivated educators and eliminating other problems that have given <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> public schools a reputation as the nation's worst. `` The bad education system is really crippling the city. Whether you have kids in school or not, it's important'' to vote, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Tuesday. Any city resident older than 18 is eligible to vote in the elections. `` I know that the system will work if we have parent participation,'' said <PERSON> Reaver </PERSON> <PERSON> Barlowe-Bell </PERSON>, a parent candidate at her 15-year-old daughter's high school and a community candidate at an elementary school. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyton-Smith </PERSON> is seeking a spot as a community representative on the council at her alma mater, <ORGANIZATION> Farragut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` I graduated from there in 1965 and they were educating the children then. I'd like to see it go back to what it once was,'' she said. Each council is to hold its first meeting within seven days of the election, said volunteer <PERSON> Dalila </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> at the council hotline telephone number. The councils are required to meet at least once a month.

 The punch lines were missing when the nation's top cartoonists gathered Tuesday, but the message was clear: `` People who do n't know how to read, do n't get the point.'' The cartoonists left the captions off a series of special drawings to show how a person who ca n't read sees the comics, said <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, author of `` Beetle Bailey'' and an organizer of `` Cartoonists For Literacy.'' `` Comics have always helped people to read. A lot of people learned to read by reading the comics,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` And it's our livelihood, after all If people do n't know how to read, they're not reading our comics.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said he got the artists together because he thought their work could lead more people to read and encourage others to help them learn. Thirty-three artists attended Tuesday's demonstration and others contributed drawings. On display at the <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonsson </PERSON> Central Library, the city's main library, were drawings of `` Peanuts,'' `` <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON>,'' `` Hi and <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>,'' and `` <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON> the Horrible.'' The group's presentation in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> represents the first organized effort by cartoonists to battle illiteracy. Cartoonists have previously collectively dealt with such issues as hunger and homelessness. Some of the cartoonists Tuesday turned out special drawings during a program at the library. About 100 people watched as the cartoonists took turns drawing their characters without captions, illustrating how words make the comics funny. The cartoons promoting literacy will be distributed to newspapers through syndicates. `` Hopefully, it'll dramatize the impact of the absence of the punch line,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>, creator of `` Hi and <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>.'' `` Most of us who know how to read and write ca n't identify that readily with what it must be like to not have that ability.'' <PERSON> Browne </PERSON>'s brother <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, who draws `` <PERSON> Hagar </PERSON> the Horrible,'' said the brutish but lovable Viking is well suited as a spokesman for the effort. `` He ca n't read, so it's a natural for this sort of thing,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Browne </PERSON> said. `` It's a point of, not so much humor, but pathos in our script. `` I think that for a long time now, cartoonists have felt that, it's time for us, since we're communicators, to do something,'' he said. `` It takes very little effort. In life you do whatever you can. It's like baseball _ you bat from wherever you're standing. And this is where we stand.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON>, creator of `` <PERSON> Tank </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>,'' sometimes pokes fun at illiterate or uneducated athletes in his popular strip. `` The comics, I'm sure, are widely read by a lot of people who do n't read anything else in the newspaper,'' <PERSON> Hinds </PERSON> said. `` The funny pictures attract people who do n't normally read. And I trust there are a lot of sports people out there who do n't do a lot of reading.''

<HEAD>House Would Expand Power of White House Environmental Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved legislation Tuesday that would expand the power of a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> environmental agency that critics said was allowed to atrophy under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The bill, which now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, would give the Council on Environmental Quality power to require federal agencies to take into account the effects of their actions on the world environment. Such issues as acid rain, ocean pollution, the ozone layer and global climactic change would come under the council's purview. The voice vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> signaled renewed confidence, particularly among Democrats, in an agency that under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was seen as having little power, said Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., who sponsored the legislation `` The council is minuscule in terms of its budget,'' <PERSON> Studds </PERSON> said. But he said it `` really is the spokesman on the environment for the president and it sets the tone for the administration.'' Separate legislation, which is now in a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION>, could potentially double the council's budget to $ 1.5 million. The current chairman of the council is <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON>, who formerly headed the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office and gained attention for his efforts to clean up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> said of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> council Tuesday, `` It did not have a high visibility for the last eight years, to put it mildly.'' He said the bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could serve a valuable secondary purpose by sending a message to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is serious about protecting the global environment. Brazilian officials have criticized the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for calling for preservation of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest while at the same time tolerating pollution within its own borders. `` Before we can put on our preacher's garb and go to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> or anywhere else in the world we need to cleanse our own hands, to get our own house in order,'' <LOCATION> Deland </LOCATION> said. `` There are a number of steps that could be taken here in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to set an example to try and help others.'' Under the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill, federal agencies would have to consider alternatives to any action that would have a harmful effect on the environment of another nation or of areas such as <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> that are outside the jurisdiction of any nation.

<HEAD>Man Shot In Head With Nail Gun Should Be OK, Doctor Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A nail accidentally fired from a nail gun penetrated about 1 -LCB- inches into a carpenter's brain and nailed his cap to his head, but the doctor who removed the nail said he should n't suffer any serious effects. `` I've had worse headaches,'' said carpenter <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Grangruth </PERSON>, who said the headache was the only complication he suffered. `` I did n't actually feel it go in,'' he said. `` I heard the gun go off. `` I tried to take my hat off and it would n't come off. Then I knew it had gone in.'' Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Himango </PERSON> said he used pliers Monday to remove the 2-inch nail from the frontal lobe of <PERSON> Grangruth </PERSON>'s brain at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grangruth </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Barnum </PERSON>, was kept in intensive care for observation. `` If he were to pick a place to put a nail in, he picked exactly the right place to put it in,'' <PERSON> Himango </PERSON> said. The same injury to other parts of the brain could have caused functional damage or death, <PERSON> Himango </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grangruth </PERSON> was working on a garage Monday in <LOCATION> Hermantown </LOCATION> when a co-worker, perched on a ladder, lowered his arm while holding the gun's trigger, said police Officer <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Perich </PERSON>. The co-worker did n't realize <PERSON> Grangruth </PERSON> was standing below Although the co-worker was holding the regular trigger, a nail gun wo n't fire until a safety trigger at the muzzle also is depressed by pushing it against the work surface where the nail is wanted. When the gun touched <PERSON> Grangruth </PERSON>'s head it went off, with 120 pounds of air pressure driving an 8-penny galvanized nail _ about an eighth-inch thick _ through his baseball cap and into his forehead. <PERSON> Grangruth </PERSON> and his co-worker went to a nearby house to call an ambulance. <PERSON> Perich </PERSON> found <PERSON> Grangruth </PERSON> alert and a little pale, but not bleeding. `` He was sitting on the couch talking,'' <PERSON> Perich </PERSON> said. `` He walked around with the nail in his head.''

 Hundreds of supporters saluted defiant peace activist <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> with balloons and a trumpet flourish Tuesday as he became the first Israeli to go to jail for meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. `` There is no replacement for dialogue; no guns or stones will solve the problem,'' <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said before stepping through an iron gate into <PERSON> Eyal </PERSON> <PERSON> Prison </PERSON>, 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. He also called on Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to follow his example and meet Palestinian leaders `` to continue the search for peace.'' Nearby, a protester hoisted a huge red-and-white balloon that said: `` Dialogue, Not Bloodshed.'' A trumpet blared, and young supporters sang `` Give Peace a Chance.'' The six-month sentence of the 63-year-old <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> comes at a time when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coalition government is deeply split over whether to meet with a PLO-sanctioned delegation in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to discuss proposals for bringing peace to the Israeli-occupied territories. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> on Friday jettisoned a proposal for such talks by its coalition partner, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It said the plan could lead <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to indirect talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist group and refuses to meet. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has proposed a meeting with the Egyptian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign ministers within two weeks to try to revive stalled peace efforts, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday. Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had proposed the three-way meeting be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to work on terms of <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, left-wing <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> legislators said they would try to change the 1986 `` Anti-Terror Amendment'' under which <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> was convicted for a September 1988 meeting with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. The law provides for a maximum three-year sentence for unauthorized meetings with members of a terrorist organization. Several <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> activists have previously been sentenced to six months for meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders in <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, in November 1986, but they remain free awaiting rulings on appeals. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, sentenced on Oct. 3 after pleading guilty to the charges, did not file an appeal. Before entering the minimum-security lockup Tuesday, <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> vowed to continue his peace efforts in an emotional speech to 700 supporters. `` They clipped my wings only for a little while, but they know I will be back on the air,'' said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> is owner of the `` <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>,'' an unauthorized radio station that broadcasts to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and neighboring <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states from a ship in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The Indian-born <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> became known as a crusader in 1964 when he made a dramatic flight to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to appeal for peace. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Tuesday, an Arab assailant who allegedly collaborated with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities fatally shot a 16-year-old Palestinian in the chest in the refugee camp Fawwar, claiming the youth stoned his car, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed the fatality but gave no details. Elsewhere in the occupied territories, soldiers shot and wounded 11 Palestinians during clashes with stone-throwing demonstrators, the reports said. During the 22-month-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation, 587 Palestinians and 40 Israelis have been killed. Palestinians have killed more than 120 suspected collaborators with the Israelis. Also Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as saying 40,000 Palestinians have been detained during the uprising and more than 15,000 wounded.

 First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>'s annual Halloweeen fund-raising drive off to an early start Tuesday, depositing quarters in the collection boxes of a witch, a soldier, a Dutch girl, a king, an astronaut, a football player and the Statue of Liberty. The costumed children came calling at the White House to help Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> draw attention to National UNICEF Day, better known as Halloween. These trick-or-treaters emerged from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portico </LOCATION> of the presidential mansion with Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and her dog Millie. After depositing a quarter in each of their orange collection boxes, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> found she had three left. `` What do I do with the three extra quarters?'' she asked the children, brought to the White House by <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> officials from six states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. She resolved the problem by slipping the coins into the boxes of three of the masqueraders. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is honorary chairwoman of the annual fund-raising drive for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund. A <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> minister, Rep. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, initiated the practice in 1950 of having children raise funds for <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> instead of soliciting candy on Halloween. <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>'s charges raised $ 17; since then, trick-or-treaters for <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> have pulled in $ 90 million. Organizers hope to raise $ 3 million this year to help provide safe drinking water and basic health care for poor children in developing countries.

<HEAD>White House Accused of Violating Laws on Record-Keeping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Researchers seeking access to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration computer tapes Tuesday accused the White House of `` wholesale violations'' of federal record-keeping laws. Lawyers for the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archive </ORGANIZATION> and organizations of librarians and historians made the accusation in a procedural motion submitted to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON> ruled on Sept. 15 that private citizens have the right to challenge White House decisions to erase the computer tapes, which are of the kind discovered by investigators in the Iran-Contra affair. The lawsuit was filed on the day before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left office and sought to prevent scheduled destruction of 12 days worth of secret electronic memos in a system used in the Executive Office of the President. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> issued a temporary restraining order in January barring the destruction of the tapes before the case went to <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>. The tapes, known as PROFS tapes after the initials of the computer system, have since been preserved under court order. In the PROFS system, the tapes automatically record all communications for use in restoring the system if the computer `` crashes.'' In the Iran-Contra affair, memoranda that had been erased in computer terminals of the participants were discovered by investigators on the backup tapes. No one knows what is on the tapes at issue in the case before <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>'s Sept. 15 ruling opened the way for further proceedings in the case, including the pre-trial discovery process in which plaintiffs and defendants exchange information about their cases. The plaintiffs hope to obtain more information in discovery about what is on the tapes. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 27 asked to have the case transferred to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, arguing that prolonged lower court proceedings would interfere with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s performance of his constitutional duties.

The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argued in September that the case presents `` a threat to the president's authority.''

<HEAD>Many Homeless Suffer From Alcoholism, Drug Addiction, AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly one-third of the nation's homeless people are impaired by alcohol or drug dependency, and about one in five suffer severe mental illness, according to a survey of both public and private relief agencies. The survey, which estimated the overall homeless population at up to 2 million _ an 18 percent increase since 1987 _ also indicated that from 28,000 to 32,000 homeless people have AIDS or diseases such as AIDS Related Complex. Moreover, the AIDS group is likely to increase by 87 percent in just the next year, it said. The report was issued late Tuesday by The Partnership for the Homeless, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the nation's largest private service organization for the homeless, and was based on questionnaires circulated to more than 500 public and private agencies in 46 citie and localities. The survey was released three days after upwards of 100,000 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in behalf of the homeless as well as all Americans yearning for more affordable housing. The Partnership proposed a `` national agenda'' for dealing with the issue, including these steps: _ An increase in the minimum wage, now $ 3.35 per hour, to $ 4.85 over the next three years _ Modest increases, graduated for family size, in the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor _ Uniform minimum amounts for welfare benefits, which now vary greatly from state to state, beginning at one-half the poverty level in 1990 and rising to at least the poverty level four years later Coupled with other steps, including a $ 680 million increase in direct housing assistance, the Partnership said the plan would necessitate a $ 2.8 billion boost in 1990 over current government spending. `` This is a watershed opportunity to begin a new decade with a comprehensive attack on all the root causes of homelessness,'' said Partnership President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have made it clear that they want some swift and effective action taken to address a problem that has become a national disgrace.'' The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> group, which has conducted similar surveys since homelessness began to surge early in the decade, said the latest results found little or no increase in the number of homeless families, reversing a four-year trend. The family portion of the homeless population has steadied at 31 percent, the survey said. The survey found shortages of emergency shelter for the homeless in all 46 localities, and virtually all reported turned homeless people away from shelters and other relief services. Overall, it said, the emergency needs of 37 percent of the homeless go unmet. The report said 21 percent of the homeless are impaired by mental illness, which afflicts mostly single men -LRB- 25 percent -RRB- and single women -LRB- 28 percent -RRB-. About 11 percent of homeless youth are mentally impaired, it said. Drug and alcohol dependency afflicts 31 percent of the homeless, including 17 percent of those in the family group, it said. The report said less than 6 percent are homeless by choice, down from 7.3 percent in the 1987 survey. The survey reported the biggest increases in the numbers of homeless in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, 70 percent; <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 67 percent; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, 60 percent, and <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, 50 percent. No city reported a decrease, and only in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, were no increases reported. It said also there were increases in the `` hidden homeless'' _ families doubled or tripled up with other families in substandard housing _ in all but one city, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Corvalan </PERSON> on Tuesday returned from 13 years of exile in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and immediately declared support for the opposition's presidential candidate The endorsement, however, could prove an embarrassment for the candidate, <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>. His main opponent has been accused <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> of forging an alliance with the extreme left. Upon arrival at <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>'s international airport, <PERSON> Corvalan </PERSON>, 73, said he would participate actively in the campaign for December elections. More than 200 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> activists waved party banners, cheered and tossed red carnations at <LOCATION> Corvalan </LOCATION>. He told reporters, `` I come prepared to participate in all the upcoming battles, the first and the principal one being the election.'' `` I will do what I can for the victory of the sole opposition candidate, <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Corvalan </PERSON>'s return was seen a potential setback for <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> backed by 17 parties. His leading opponent, <PERSON> Hernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchi </PERSON>, a former finance minister for the military government, has repeatedly accused <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> of ties to the extreme left. <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> was nominated by a coalition with parties ranging from the center-right to socialists that defeated President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in an October 1988 referendum. At that time, voters rejected a proposal that <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remain the country's leader until 1997, forcing him to call the national elections scheduled for Dec. 14. The pro-Moscow <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was excluded from the opposition coalition largely because of its ties with urban guerrilla organizations. It nonetheless has called on its ranks to support <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>. `` Right now, there has to be just one united front, to give a decisive blow to the dictatorship and move forward with the full democratization of the country,'' Corvalan declared at the airport. A former senator, <PERSON> Corvalan </PERSON> was the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s secretary-general for more than 30 years until early this year, when a party congress decided to replace him with <PERSON> Volodia </PERSON> <PERSON> Teitelboim </PERSON> He was a close ally of former President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist whose elected government fell when <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a 1973 coup. <PERSON> Corvalan </PERSON> was immediately arrested and imprisoned with many other leftists. In 1976, he was freed and expelled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in exchange for the release of Soviet dissident <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukovsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Corvalan </PERSON> was officially exiled until Sept. 1, 1988, when the government lifted bans on the return of political enemies.

<HEAD>Lebanese Peace Talks Reported Going in `Vicious Circles'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIF, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Arab mediators urged members of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s parliament Tuesday to speed up talks aimed at ending their nation's 14-year-old civil war, but a conference source said talks just ran in `` vicious circles.'' He quoted a member of the three-man <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediating committee as telling the 63 deputies: `` You have often said you would solve your country's problems in 10 hours if left alone with no external forces meddling. But we see you have spent 10 days here without achieving results.'' The source spoke on condition of anonymity and would not say which mediator made the comment. The three are foreign ministers Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghozali </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Abdul-Latif </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Filali </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>. Mediators held separate meetings with groups of legislators, trying to gain agreement on a proposed reconciliation charter. Talks began after a cease-fire took hold in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Sept. 22 that ended six months of artillery duels between Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian forces and an alliance of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and Moslems militias The shelling killed more than 900 people. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Tuesday, snipers exchanged gunfire along the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> capital's dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> and the first battle fatality was reported since the truce took effect. First Lt. <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslan </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem, was killed and three soldiers were wounded in a clash between Moslem troops and Christian army units. An 18-member task force in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> is formulating a draft for political reforms. Deputies were reported to be moving slowly toward a peace plan after hard-line Christians conceded that immediate Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would allow militias to take control of Moslem regions. The presence of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is the main issue that has threatened to undermine the talks. The Arab committee proposes a phased <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> withdrawal from the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> area to be completed in two years. A total pullout would depend on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ending its occupation of a security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and conclusion of a Syrian-Lebanese security pact. The Moslems and their Syrian backers have said <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> should withdraw its troops only after a political settlement of the civil war has been achieved. Before the Christians agree to political reforms, they want guarantees of a Syrian pullout within six months. Acknowledgement by <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> legislators that a quick Syrian withdrawal could spur more turmoil raised speculation that a compromise was in the works. Later, however, `` sharp differences on the Syrian role were renewed, and it was as if the deputies were back at the starting point,'' one source said. Another said, `` They keep moving in vicious circles, going back on what they had indicated they will approve.'' Syrian troops have been in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> violated its mandate by backing the Moslems in the civil war. Moslems say they now make up 55 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s population and want more political power than was accorded them in the unwritten national covenant going back to independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, when Christians were in the majority. In <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, State Prosecutor <PERSON> Rallis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavrielides </PERSON> said in court Tuesday that six Lebanese men being tried for illegal arms possession there all confessed they went to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last May to assassinate <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Under <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> law, arms possession carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Plotting to kill, the charge that was dropped, is punishable by a lesser maximum of 14 years imprisonment. <PERSON> Gavrielides </PERSON> said the accused confessed they intended to shoot down <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s helicopter. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was to pass through <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> to attend an Arab summit meeting on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but canceled the trip.

 Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> complained Tuesday that interference by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> undermined the ability of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to handle last week's Panamanian crisis. `` It's really not their bailiwick,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He contended the lawmakers `` can not contribute anything in a positive nature while the crisis is still being managed.'' `` We had situations here where members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> were literally calling -LRB- executive branch -RRB- agencies downtown, or even people in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, as these events unfolded, demanding information. That creates all kinds of problems,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>, who served more than 10 years in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> before becoming defense secretary this year, declined to name any names. The secretary's remarks came in the wake of a barrage of criticism from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> about the way <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials dealt with last week's abortive coup against the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> argued that administration and military officials were forced to answer the congressional queries, even though they were trying to do their jobs in a crisis environment. The defense secretary said a second problem was created when lawmakers got information _ `` under these circumstances, it usually tends to be just a small piece of the total picture,'' and public statements based on that information sometimes were found later to be inaccurate. Not only will lawmakers make `` potentially embarrassing'' mistakes, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> contended, they `` certainly complicate our lives when they run out and make public pronoucements in front of the press, knowing only half of what there is to know.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> cited as a case in point the assertion that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was offered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, repeatedly has contended that was the case, although <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and other administration officials say they've found no evidence that such an offer was ever made. `` The president is the commander-in-chief. He's the one who has to manage a crisis. You can not have every member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> involved,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. The secretary said that while members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have legitimate oversight roles, `` they ought to refrain from trying to intrude in the process while it is still unfolding.'' On budget issues, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said he would recommend to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a veto of the defense authorization bill if funds for strategic programs such as the B-2 Stealth bomber and the Strategic Defense Initiative are inadequate and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has added too much money for weapons he has proposed for cancellation. In response to calls from <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers that the administration take a stand on final budget total for SDI, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the Pentagon was seeking the $ 4.5 billion approved in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version of the defense authorization bill. But acknowledging the realities of current <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> egotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which approved $ 3.1 billion, he said, `` It's not a matter of our dictating a particular number and saying this is absolutely got to be -LRB- it -RRB-.'' Questioned about congressional warnings that a fleet of 132 B-2 bombers at an eventual cost of $ 70 billion is impossible in the current fiscal climate, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> retorted that if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accepted his budget there would be no problem in finding the money. `` We showed them how to do it,'' he said, referring to the budget he proposed in May that included cancellation of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>' V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D Tomcat jetfighter _ weapons that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to keep alive.

He said that security concerns would not stand in the way of a summit. `` That could be worked out.'' As for a meeting Nov. 20 meeting of lower-level officials for preliminary discussions, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` I'm sure that's fine with us.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the most likely site for a summit would be in one of the countries that extended the invitation. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> already had considered having a drug summit in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. `` We've looked at all kinds of options _ I do n't think that would be an obstacle from our point of view.''

 Rape and incest victims are victimized again under a state law that requires them to report the crimes before they can get publicly funded abortions, a lawmaker said Tuesday while pushing for change in the law. New legislation would eliminate the reporting requirement. It is part of a nine-part package of bills designed to reduce abortion restrictions in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and offer an alternative to proposals for further controls. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled a hearing on a series of abortion-related bills Friday. The sponsor of the reporting requirement repeal, state Rep. <PERSON> Babette </PERSON> <PERSON> Josephs </PERSON>, said the requirement serves `` no law-enforcement value.'' The law is especially tough on young girls who have been raped by a male relative and do not have family support to report the crime, she said. `` Unable to obtain an abortion, she puts her own life at some risk, probably because of her young age, and has a child who's unwanted,'' she said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON>, a counselor at the Choice Hotline in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said many women fear retaliation from their attackers if they report the crime. Callers to the hot line reported having problems with police who doubt their stories, she said. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Smink </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the number of Medicaid-funded abortions dropped from 436 in fiscal year 1987-88 to 36 the following year. The Abortion Control Act of 1988, which included the reporting provision, was signed into law March 1988. The legislature's chief abortion opponent, state Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, said the reporting requirement is designed to catch rapists and prevent fraudulent reporting of a crime to obtain public funding for an abortion.

<HEAD>Azerbaijan Group Calls off Rail Strike</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of a political movement in the southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> suspended on Tuesday a rail strike that choked off supplies of fuel, food and housing supplies to neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, a member said. `` We decided in a directive to open the railroad to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> as of 22:00 -LRB- 10 p.m. -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Ingilap </PERSON> <PERSON> Aslanov </PERSON>, a member of the grass-roots <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and of the group's strike committee, in a telephone interview from the Azerbaijani capital <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. He said the strike was suspended until Oct. 23 to give Soviet legislators in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> a chance to respond to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s demands to remove special <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> administration of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> area _ the source of a bloody ethnic dispute between Azerbaijanis and Armenians. Soviet troops moved into the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics last week to break the blockade that has been strangling <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the disputed territory of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. About 400 trains with 60,000 cars were reported idled. Official news media said Tuesday that in the previous 24 hours authorities managed to push 1,748 carloads of supplies through to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. But Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> told the Supreme Soviet legislature that did not include oil products. A fuel shortage has stranded ambulances and halted harvesting in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s fields. Reports said freight arriving in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> under military guard was damaged. <PERSON> Aslanov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> wanted the issue of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> taken up by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the country's highest-ranking executive body, but settled for demanding that the Supreme Soviet legislature review the question. If it does not do so by Oct. 23, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> will call a general strike that once again will include the railroads, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leadership made the decision after thousands of people gathered Sunday on the main square of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, he said. The People's Front says the rail strike started Sept. 4, but Armenian officials say the flow of goods by rail through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> dried up almost three months ago. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, opening the fall session of the Supreme Soviet on Sept. 25, called for firm steps to break the transportation deadlock. After hearing Tuesday from <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON>, the Supreme Soviet once again called on <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to end their dispute. <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> said `` blown-up bridges and continuing strafing of trains'' still makes transport difficult in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians and Azerbaijanis have engaged in ethnic violence for 19 months, largely over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Armenians want control of the area, a section of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> where most inhabitants are Armenian. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> wants to retain control, and seeks an end to the special administration from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that was imposed in January in an effort to calm the situation. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that factory-built temporary houses for victims of last December's Armenian earthquake were smashed into piles of metal, broken glass and crushed window frames during transit Prefurnished rooms for the earthquake reconstruction project arrived with ovens, sinks, pipes and beds ruined, the newspaper said. `` They simply can not be restored,'' Pravda said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said it is proving particularly hard to restore transport of supplies in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. The regions of <LOCATION> Martuninski </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gadrutski </PERSON> have been cut off since a bridge was blown up Saturday, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> also said weapons were found hidden in sacks of flour on an Armenian helicopter relief flight. The pilot denied any knowledge of the weapons.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has proposed a meeting with the Egyptian and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign ministers in the next two weeks to try to revive stalled peace efforts, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Tuesday. The Israeli officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had proposed a five-point plan. They said that according to the plan, the three-way meeting would be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the participants would try to work out the terms of <LOCATION> Palestinian-Israeli </LOCATION> talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in recent telephone discussions with the Israeli and Egyptian foreign ministers, outlined the `` framework for getting to a dialogue'' and suggested a meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. She said the two governments had not yet responded to the idea of a meeting. `` The secretary is working with the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the government of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, trying to produce a framework that would meet <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s basic concerns about beginning a dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. The Israeli officials said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal focuses on working out an agenda for the talks in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, and reaching agreement on the difficult issue of who will represent the Palestinians. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> initiative came after Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc voted down a proposal in the inner <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to accept an Egyptian call for talks with Palestinians in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> Palestinians have criticized the decision, saying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is blocking the peace process. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> first outlined his ideas to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> in telephone calls beginning Friday, after which they were presented in writing by <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said. As part of the consultations on the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposal, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, met with <PERSON> Abdel-Meguid </PERSON> Tuesday and then flew to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to consult with <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> were `` taking this proposal seriously'' but would not automatically accept <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s ideas or even his invitation for talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have to agree to everything just for the sake of agreement,'' he said. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Naveh </PERSON>, an adviser to Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> there could be `` an opening'' for holding such talks in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, but said no formal invitation had been offered or decision made. Another government official said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accepted the idea of talks with Palestinians, but wanted the right to veto proposed Palestinian negotiators. He said the problem with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s proposal had been its indirect effort to involve the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We ca n't sit for dialogue with a delegation that gets its authority from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or is part of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the official. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> officially views the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist organization and refuses to deal with it. The government official also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not agree to an open-ended agenda, which was demanded by the Palestinians. He said talks should be limited to implementing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan, set forth in May, to hold elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is studying <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal. He spoke on condition of anonymity and did not elaborate. Earlier Tuesday, 30 right-wing members of the 120-seat <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament, warned <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> they opposed talks with Palestinians in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> and would oppose him in parliament if he went forward with that plan. They expressed fears that the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposal, like the <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> plan before it, would drag <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> into indirect talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Eytan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> member, described the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposal on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio as `` a new initiative to bring the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> into the game.'' Energy Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said his party would accept the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal and warned that the ruling coalition could dissolve if the idea was rejected. `` If <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal is rejected by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, I think the basis for this government will not exist,'' he said. `` Without it, there is no justification to go on with a deadlocked government.''

 The presidents of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, where the illegal cocaine trade has its roots, invited President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Tuesday to attend a drug summit within 90 days. He accepted immediately. In a brief communique at the end of a five-hour meeting on a common anti-drug strategy, the leaders said <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders also should take part in the summit, to be held in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. They pledged to continue `` all-out war'' on drug trafficking. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` The president will go.'' He said 90 days was `` within the time frame we have been considering. It's reasonable.'' In their communique, Presidents <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zamora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> said both the production and consumption of cocaine must be addressed. The statement appeared to reflect Latin American concern over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s emphasis on police and military actions against the trade. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> suggested details of the summit be worked out at a meeting Nov. 20 in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, of lower-level officials. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no objection to participation by Europeans and security concerns would not stand in the way of a summit. Of a planning meeting Nov. 20, he said: `` I'm sure that's fine with us. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has been promoting inclusion of European nations as active participants in a war against the cocaine traffic. If the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is successful in slowing the flow of cocaine over its borders, he says, smugglers will shift their focus to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The Peruvian president read the communique to hundreds of reporters gathered in <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION> for the closed-door summit, but did not answer questions. A battalion of 300 soldiers guarded the Las Dunas Hotel, site of the meeting, and 3,000 plainclothes policemen circulated in this desert city of 350,000 people 185 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Heavy security was ordered in case of attacks by the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION>, a Maoist guerrilla group that has fought Peruvian governments since 1980 and works with traffickers in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, source of more than 60 percent of the world's coca leaf, the raw material for cocaine. A bomb exploded before dawn Tuesday in Trujillo, a northern city where five <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> foreign ministers were meeting to prepare the agenda for a summit of the Group of Eight countries that begins Wednesday in <LOCATION> Ica </LOCATION>. It went off at the offices of a public housing agency, damaging the building but causing no injuries. Police said no group claimed responsibility. <ORGANIZATION> Ica </ORGANIZATION> suffered two brief blackouts Tuesday morning, but officials said technical problems caused them, not sabotage. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> have said military-style repression of the drug trade should be accompanied by more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid to provide alternative crops or sources of income for the hundreds of thousands of peasants who grow coca. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> began a crackdown on Colombian cocaine barons Aug. 19 and has received $ 65 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to help in the effort. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> has been especially vocal on what he considers the limitations of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan, which includes $ 261 million for the three countries, mainly in the form of weapons. `` If <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> produces 60 percent of the coca leaf, how is it possible the Peruvian government is assigned $ 60 million when $ 8 billion is to be spent on the fight within the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>?'' he asked foreign reporters last week. `` This does n't seem serious to me.'' <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> produce more than 90 percent of the world's coca Colombian drug cartels turn semi-refined coca paste from the two countries into pure cocaine and smuggle it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Hundreds of thousands of peasants in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> live by growing coca. Officials of both countries say there is little hope of eradicating the crop unless the growers have another way of making a living. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> says it needs stable world prices for coffee, its main legal export. Otherwise, the Colombians say, the cocaine-dependent economy could collapse if the war against drug trafficking was successful. `` It's not a problem of donating some helicopters, sometimes very old helicopters, or donating rifles or bullets,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` It would be enough to offer a good price and a guaranteed market for the products that could substitute for coca.'' <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has an added worry because of support the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> has among the peasants who grow coca. The rebels protect the peasants against a U.S.-financed coca eradication program, in return collecting a `` tax'' of 10 to 15 percent of their earnings. Peruvian officials fear Shining Path ranks will expand swiftly if the government succeeds in reducing the cocaine trade without providing alternate sources of income to peasants. `` We have a double problem in the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> _ coca cultivation and subversion,'' <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said. `` Unless coca substitution is gradual, all we will acheive is to make poor peasants even poorer and push them into the arms of the subversive movement.''

 Some of the military forces involved in the failed coup attempt in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have been flown by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and invited to seek political asylum, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said 42 Panamanians had been admitted on humanitarian grounds. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the group included `` coup members and their families.'' The Panamanians `` had reason to believe the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime would seek them out for persecution, either because of alleged involvement in the Oct. 3 coup attempt, or because of their family relationship with the alleged coup plotters,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The group is believed to include <PERSON> Adela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, widow of the coup leader, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>. She was accompanied by members of her family. Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON>, believed to be the highest-ranking coup participant to escape capture, also was reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> refused to identify any of the refugees, saying the publishing of their pictures might result in their deaths. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> will interview the Panamanians on Friday, said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jervis </PERSON>. `` I assume some will ask for asylum'' while others may cite some other legal basis for remaining in this country, he said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the Panamanians are being received by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which provides assistance to refugees and people given asylum. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> are debriefing them. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Franken </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> said from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that his group assured the Panamanians that their whereabouts would not be divulged. `` Those that have relatives somewhere in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we will try to reunite them,'' he said. `` Those that do n't, we will try to find resettlement sites around the country. These people came in virtually with what they have on their backs.'' Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said there had been dissension and confusion among the coup leaders and an argument about what to do with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> ruler <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it was clear that <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> `` had no intention, ever,'' of turning <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said an unnamed officer taking part in the coup insisted that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> be given to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and argued with <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the officer eventually gave up the dispute and left the military headquarters because he feared that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had or would become aware of his opinions. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the officer was among those who met later with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, second in command of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the area. Later the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying that `` there was no mention to Gen. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> that there had been any internal debate'' among the coup plotters. The spokesman said it is n't clear to what extent those claiming to have held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for several hours really had him under their control. `` You have someone who was one of the coup plotters saying, ` Well, we ought to' turn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He does n't prevail, and he leaves. And he communicates -LRB- to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- that the people holding Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> still have no intention of turning him over to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` There was never a request for us to come and get him, they never offered him to us.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> acknowledged that he had erred last week by saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were deployed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at two key points merely to safeguard Americans and to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. In fact, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been asked by the rebels to station the forces to block reinforcements for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he had not been aware of the facts when he made his original statement. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also had said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had only third-party contact with the rebels before the coup, when, in fact, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were in touch directly with <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said he did n't know if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been aware of the direct discussion with <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the administration's handling of the matter and the decision not to provide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military force to the rebels. Amid charges that the administration was operating in a void, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` had plenty of information, he made the decision that he thought was best and the decision we still think is right. We do n't have any questioning about the correctness of that decision.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> seemed to back away from administration complaints about congressional interference in foreign affairs, particularly in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We do n't have any specific complaints,'' he said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had no plan for additional economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, it was announced in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON>, a 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> veteran, would replace <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maisto </PERSON> as charge d'affaires, the acting head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy. <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> has served in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> during the dispatch of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops there in 1965.

 Some opposition politicians on Tuesday predicted political instability as a result of compromises made at a historic Communist congress that dissolved the old party and formed a new Socialist group. The four-day congress that ended Monday overwhelmingly approved a new party line calling for `` a constitutional state based on a multiparty system where the source of the power is the will of the people expressed in free elections.'' It adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break with the Leninist mold. But still unclear is whether the new party will divest itself of all remnants of Communist rule, and how fast. The congress elected <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, formerly <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman, as president of the new party. It named a 25-member presidium, where reformers are in the majority. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a key reformer on the presidium, had complaints about the new party, Hungarian radio said Tuesday. It quoted him as saying in an interview with a Finnish newspaper that `` too many differences among the reformers'' exist. The opposition initially reacted to the new party with skepticism, and some people privately said they were not impressed by the change because economic problems persist. Speaking at a rally of about 600 people Tuesday, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> acknowledged that the new party had image problems. `` Some still feel that the Communists are incapable of democratization,'' he conceded. He told reporters later that `` major changes are required for the party to win the people's trust.'' In his speech, <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said three issues divided the party: party chapters at the workplace, the workers' militia, and the assets of the disbanded party. Radical reformers demand ending party representation at the workplace and abolishing the workers' militia, an armed unit of the old party now likely to come under army control. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said some delegates to the congress felt the new party should not accept the assets of the old. But he said that would have made the new party `` poorer than the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the largest independent opposition party.'' <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Biro </PERSON> of the Democratic Forum expressed skepticism about the political changes. `` I do not consider fortunate the agreement between the various forces, although I am glad that the left wing of the party, which does not wish to accept democracy, can not feel at home in this successor party,'' <PERSON> Biro </PERSON> told the Mai Nap newspaper. He was apparently referring to the congress' decision to reject radical reformers' demands that diehard Marxists be shut out of the party. `` The best solution would have been a clear split, with the left wing of the party going off on its own,'' <PERSON> Biro </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` Judging by the composition of the presidium, such a split should not be ruled out.'' `` We suspect that no essential change occurred'' at the party congress, said <PERSON> Tibor </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidos </PERSON> of the opposition Free Democrats. `` Despite the role of the platforms, the real decisions were made in camera by the platform leaders. We fear that this party will remain a source of instability in the country.'' <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockenbauer </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, said he believed unity was achieved at the congress through compromise on the part of radical reformers and could lead to `` the new party's loss of credibility in the public view.'' A <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> taxi driver said: `` They can talk till they drop. All I know is that I work 14 hours a day to feed my two kids.'' Political observers here agree effective dismantling of Communist control is a long-term task. To achieve credibility before elections to be held by next June, the new party will have to relinquish its hold on the media, dissolve the workers' militia, surrender its privileges and dissolve its chapters at the workplace. It will have to open its books, turn its assets over to the government and have them shared at least in part by the new political parties. The <ORGANIZATION> Ferenc </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muennich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> group, said it will discuss its future Wednesday. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION>, another conservative group, said the old <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> remained functional and urged true Communists not to join the new one.

Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Anglican churches in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> called for stronger economic pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, however, at a separate meeting with delegates to the party's annual four-day conference in this seaside resort 200 miles northwest of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> praised Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s position on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which supports mild sanctions. He said tough sanctions would not help end apartheid, the government policy of racial separation. `` Political propaganda has attempted to establish the myth that black South Africans are pro-sanctions and support the politics of violent confrontation inside the country,'' he said. `` Nothing could be further from the truth.'' <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> said money from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> was being used to support those who favor of violence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Launch of Soviet Module Delayed Because of Guidance Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet space officials said Tuesday that the delay in the launch of a module for the space station Mir was prompted by worries about its guidance and docking system. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted chief cosmonaut <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Solovev </PERSON> as saying the module, which had been scheduled for launch in mid-September, will instead blast off Nov. 28. Two modules are to be flown to Mir, and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say which one was affected by the delay. One module was to carry quail eggs to be hatched in an experiment on weightlessness as well as a `` space motorcycle'' to be used in short trips between objects in space. The second module includes a telescopic camera for studying the stars and equipment to grow vegetables and crystals for electronics. <PERSON> Solovev </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> that some elements of the module's guidance and docking system have proved unreliable in ground tests. He said scientists decided to delay the launch even though the system has worked in the past. The Mir station was unmanned for more than four months earlier this year to cut down on costs and give scientists a chance to prepare the modules. Cosmonauts <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> blasted off Sept. 5 for a six-month mission aboard Mir.

<HEAD>Timman, Speelman Draw Sixth Game; Timman Leads 3.5-2.5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> on Tuesday agreed to a draw with <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> after 53 moves in the sixth round of their World Chess Championship Candidates' semifinal and retained a one-point lead. With two games remaining, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> leads 3.5-2 .5 A win scores 1 point and a draw .5. `` For <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>, time is beginning to run out,'' said <PERSON> Leontxo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> chess commentator. Following a blunder on the 17th move, <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>, playing white, struggled a pawn down in an endgame for the rest of the game. In the other semifinal, former world champion <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> took a surprise timeout against fellow Soviet <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> to postpone their fifth game until Thursday. <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> is leading 2.5-1 .5 after four games, but he has been off form throughout the contest His only victory came in the third game when the heavily outranked <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON> blundered horribly in a favorable position. Following <PERSON> Yusupov </PERSON>'s timeout on Sunday, the two Soviets will have had a four-day break before resuming the second half of their duel. The winner of the candidates cycle will challenge world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> for his title in a 24-game match beginning in October 1990. The winning semi-finalists will face off in the candidates' final next March. The most dramatic moment Tuesday came when <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON> pondered over his 17th move. After 21 minutes, <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>'s move let the Dutchman win a pawn with a simple trick. `` <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> sees 12-move tactics in positions like this. What's he doing falling for a two-mover,'' said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Tisdall </PERSON>, an international master who acts as <PERSON> Speelman </PERSON>'s chief second. `` He would n't fall for this trick in a blitz game,'' he said. Following a series of exchanges, <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> emerged a pawn ahead in an ending with rooks and pawns, but he was unable to create any serious winning prospects. The seventh game is scheduled for Thursday with <PERSON> Timman </PERSON> playing white. Neither player has so far used his one allocated timeout. If either contest ends in a 4-4 tie, two further games will be played followed, if necessary, by sudden-death tiebreakers at increasingly high speeds.

 A federal appeals court Tuesday upheld the right of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> to deny financial aid to private groups supporting abortions in foreign countries. A three-judge panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> ruled against constitutional challenges filed by three family planning organizations, two foreign and one based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that had sued AID in 1985 challenging the policy. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration decided in 1984 that it would no longer contribute to non-government organizations which perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations. In 1988, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court Judge June Green ruled that the policy violated the constitutional right of the U.S.-based group, <ORGANIZATION> DKT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, to associate with the foreign organizations. The foreign groups refused to comply with AID's abortion-related restrictions. They are the Parivar Seva Sanstha based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Programmes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The appeals panel reversed Green in a 2-1 decision, while upholding other portions of her decision favorable to AID. `` AID essentially says <ORGANIZATION> DKT </ORGANIZATION> is just as free to associate'' with the foreign groups `` as they ever were. They just ca n't do it on our money,'' said the appeals court opinion by Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON>. `` The only thing that presently prevents DKT'' and the foreign groups `` from associating ... is the unwillingness or inability of <ORGANIZATION> DKT </ORGANIZATION> and its prospective partners to fund the project,'' said the opinion. <PERSON> Sentelle </PERSON> said that if <ORGANIZATION> DKT </ORGANIZATION> and the foreign groups are willing to finance the project with their own money or from a source other than <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign aid funds `` then they can undertake the project immediately.'' The appeals court returned the case to <PERSON> Green </PERSON> with instructions that it be dismissed. In a dissent, Judge <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> said AID has `` unconstitutionally deployed its puissant purse to restrain the privately funded speech and association of domestic non-governmental organizations engaged in family planning work overseas.'' AID has continued its policy while appealing Green's decision.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> turned away free-speech arguments Tuesday and allowed the use of a federal racketeering law against 26 anti-abortion protesters in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The court let stand a successful lawsuit against the protesters by the operators of an abortion clinic in that city. Similar lawsuits, each invoking the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act -LRB- RICO -RRB-, have been filed against `` pro-life'' activists in cities such as <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Using the federal law lets those who win suits collect three times whatever financial damages they prove, a feature not available in many suits filed under state law. In the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> case, the clinic operators were awarded about $ 2,600 in tripled RICO damages. In a series of past rulings, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has permitted broad use of the law _ allowing lawsuits by anyone whose property or business is harmed by a `` pattern'' of illegal activities. The litigation strategy has proved troubling to some abortion rights advocates, who fear that political protesters will be labeled `` racketeers'' and held financially liable for nothing more than expressing their views. For example, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Califa </PERSON> recently wrote: `` The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> believes that civil RICO's potential for chilling First Amendment rights of expression is enormous. But in upholding a $ 108,000 award against the 26 <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> protesters last March, the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said their actions `` went beyond ... constitutional rights of speech and protest.'' The tripled damages under RICO formed only a small part of the total damages. Of the $ 108,000, $ 65,000 went to attorney's fees and more than $ 40,000 went to the clinic as non-RICO damages. The protesters on four occasions from 1984 to 1986 unlawfully entered the Northeast Women's Center in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. According to trial testimony, protesters threw medical supplies on the floor, damaged equipment, assaulted the clinic's employees and harassed patients. Tuesday's action does not preclude the nation's highest court from granting review in some future case in which more peaceable anti-abortion demonstrators are sued under the racketeering law. `` This is one battle in a long war,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON>, one of the 26 <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> protesters and executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>. `` We intend to continue our efforts to non-violently save children and mothers from abortion at the abortion facilities. This case will not deter that one bit,'' <PERSON> McMonagle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiryak </PERSON>, the abortion clinic's lawyer, said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> action `` shows that our society will not tolerate the use of fear and intimidation by religious fanatics to impose their will on women seeking abortion services.'' In their appeal, the 26 protesters decried `` an unprecedented and dangerous expansion of'' the federal law primarily aimed at fighting organized crime. They said the law was being used to stifle political expression. `` Under the 3rd Circuit's interpretations of RICO ... <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was a racketeer when he trespassed on private property and conspired with others in an attempt to change the business policies of owners of segregated lunch counters,'' the appeal contended. `` So, too, is anyone participating in a sit-in against apartheid with the goal of changing the investment policies of a university,'' the appeal said, arguing that no RICO violation should be found if no economic profit motive exists. Only Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who cited a split among federal appeals courts over the for-profit requirement in RICO cases, voted to study the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> protesters' appeal. The votes of four justices are needed to grant such review. In other action, the court: _ Agreed to use a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case to clarify when sentencing judges may hand down extra prison time for habitual criminals _ Said it will decide in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case what retroactive effect to give its ruling last June that allowed states to execute mentally retarded killers if jurors are allowed to take into account the defendant's mental state _ Agreed to resolve a dispute in the federal prosecution of nine <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> men accused of robbing $ 7.2 million from a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> depot in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> six years ago _ Set aside a $ 1,000 fine against an <LOCATION> Easton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, newspaper for publishing a bookmaker's telephone conversations that were tapped by police _ Agreed to referee a battle over patent rights for medical devices, granting an appeal by <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that seeks reinstatement of a $ 26.7 million award won, and then lost, against a competitor

<HEAD>History Professor Receives First Tenure Bid in 19 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> expert on Vietnamese history said she's been offered tenure, nearly two decades since the school made its last such appointment within the history department. `` It's a milestone, and I hope it's also a precedent,'' associate professor <PERSON> Hue-Tam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> said in an interview Friday. `` I hope it will be the first of many more such promotions.'' <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> said she had been offered a lifetime post, but the school administration had not completed contract negotiations with her. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> officials said a tenure appointment would not be announced until it becomes official. The last junior professors tenured in the history department received their promotions in 1970. In recent years, critics have insisted the tenure system favors established scholars over young professors from inside <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. The history department, in particular, was at the center of controversy three years ago when a pair of popular American history professors were denied tenure. Last year, the department formed a committee to improve the status of junior professors. The committee recommended such measures as more internal promotions to make junior faculty feel more like valued members of the department. <PERSON> Tai </PERSON>, 40, received her doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, and published a book in 1983 on peasant politics in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. A second book on radical politics in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is scheduled for release soon, she said. The history department voted to tenure <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> in 1987, but an advisory committee expressed reservations because she had not finished her second book. Rather than being forced to leave <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> said she received an extended contract so she could finish the manuscript. If <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> accepts the university's offer, she will be the third tenured woman in the history department. <PERSON> Tai </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s vigorous tenure system is particularly hard on women, since female scholars often have young children and family responsibilities. Women comprise about 8 percent of the tenured professors in the faculty of arts and sciences, and 27.7 percent of the junior faculty.

 A federal judge Tuesday night rejected a request to block the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis and its nuclear-powered cargo, saying `` this court will not substitute its own judgment'' for that of space experts. Three environmental groups had asked that the liftoff be scrubbed on the grounds the nuclear generators, used on 22 previous missions, posed unacceptable risks. `` Countdown has already begun, and the government states that the mission is ready for launch,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>. `` The court concludes that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has complied with requirements of the National Environmental Protection Act.'' After the judge ruled, though, the mission was postponed, perhaps until Monday, because of a faulty engine control system. It had been scheduled for launch on Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and two other environmental groups had sought to stop the launch on grounds that deadly plutonium-238 would spread across the skies of central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in case of an accident. `` It is not the function of this court to decide whether the government's decision to go forward with the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> is a good one,'' he said in a written opinion. Instead, he said, he only needed to rule whether the environmental impact statement filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Natiional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has enough information `` to allow the agency to take a hard look at the issues and make a reasoned decision.'' Never before had a court been asked to stop a manned launch. <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said that granting a temporary restraining order requested by the three citizens' groups would have a costly adverse effect on the public interest _ $ 164 million just to maintain the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> program until the next launch opportunity in 18 months. Long delays have already raised the cost of the Galileo mission to $ 1.5 billion. The three groups contended <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> failed to follow environmental rules and should be stopped from launching Atlantis because `` there is a very high probability of an accident'' that could spread deadly plutonium over central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. To gain momentum for its six-year trip to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe will be sent looping around <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and twice around <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The citizens groups contend the greatest danger will be when the probe comes within 600 miles of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in December 1990 and within 200 miles two years later. But <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says the chances of an accident then are 5 in 10 million. The probe will carry two electrical generators, each carryign 24.7 pounds of plutonium-238. These generators produce electricity from the heat generated by the radioactivedecay of the plutonium. `` An accidental plutonium release at various stages of the mission might cause an increase in cancer rates _ although it is disputed whether increase would be significant,'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said in his 17-page opinion. `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> concludes that the residual risks associated with the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> are two to three times less than many of the risks associated with everyday life.'' One of the plaintiff lawyers, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, said after the judge's ruling, `` We thought we had a very strong case in terms of the violations of the National Environmental Policy Act.'' <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, had had argued earlier that, `` The so-called estimates of risk are very tenuous themselves because they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- do n't have good historical data.'' `` Columbus did n't have much experience either,'' said <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> at the hearing, the day after the federal holiday honoring the discoverer of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` He was n't going to contaminate the world,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> countered. The coalition, which has threatened to disrupt the launch physically if it does n't succeed in court, claims `` irreparable harm'' can result if the shuttle should have a launch explosion similar to the one that destroyed Challenger and killed its crew of seven in 1986. `` There is great disagreement as to the likelihood of a plutonium release,'' said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> lawyer arguing the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> case, accused the citizens groups of waiting until the 11th hour before bringing their suit and sitting out the environmental hearings in the past few years. `` Some of the scientific missions planned for <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> would have to be scrapped with a delay of even a few days,'' he told Judge <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> hopes to get a close-up view for the first time of two asteroids, Gaspra and <PERSON> Ida </PERSON>, but has said the launch must be by mid-October to make the rendezvous. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has sent 38 of RTGs _ for radioisotopic thermoelectric generators _ into space on 22 missions. Some, like <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, had more than one RTG. Three of the RTGs were involved in accidents, but only one resulted in a release of plutonium _ by design, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says. Since then, the agency contends, the RTGs have undergone a design change and `` the most comprehensive analysis ever performed'' shows it would prevent plutonium release even in an accident like that of Challenger. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> argued that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> failed to consider other times and launch vehicles for <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>. The opportunity for a launch to Jupiter comes again in 1991 and in 1993. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it can not get a single-use Titan 4 rocket from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> for such a launch until 1995 and that the plaintiffs had not shown anything would be gained by a delay. The citizens groups argued that two major environmental studies disagree on the risk involved in the Galileo launch, but government attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said `` both reports, using different approaches, calculate very low risks.'' The other two groups involved are the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the Foundation on Economic Trends.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday night postponed the launch of space shuttle Atlantis for several days because of a faulty master control system in one of the spaceship's three main engines. The flight had been scheduled for Thursday. Officials said the launch could be rescheduled for as early as Monday, but they would not have a definite date for a day or two. The delay was announced shortly after a federal judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rejected a request by three anti-nuclear groups that the launch be scrubbed because <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> will carry a plutonium-powered planetary spacecraft bound for Jupiter. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Richie </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, one of the groups, said the decision would be appealed. Launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said the decision to delay the launch came after engineers had tested the suspect master controller for several hours and could not learn why it had given a false signal during a check Monday night. <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said the controller was being replaced and that work was starting immediately. Earlier, officials had said that a changeout would mean a delay of about a week. But officials said the task might be accomplished sooner and <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said, `` We expect to have a new launch date in the next couple of days.'' The countdown, which began Monday, was halted. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> heard 2 -LCB- hours of arguments before issuing his ruling. The anti-nuclear groups had asked that the liftoff be scrubbed on grounds that radioactive plutonium 238 particles would spread over east-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> if Atlantis exploded. The plutonium is in two nuclear-powered generators that provide electricity for the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft bound for Jupiter. `` The court concludes that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has complied with requirements of the National Environmental Protection Act,'' <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> said. Never before had a court been asked to stop a space launch. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys representing <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had replied that the $ 1.5 billion, six-year <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> mission to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> carried `` very low risks'' and that the two nuclear generators aboard the probe were well shielded and similar to 38 that have flown on 22 previous space missions. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> test director <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinbach </PERSON> reported earlier Tuesday that during overnight testing there was an erroneous reading in a computer-operated controller in one of Atlantis' three main engines. The device, the size of a 17-inch portable television, controls all engine functions during liftoff. Subsequent tests did not reproduce the bad reading, but because it was not thoroughly understood, officials said they might have to replace the unit. `` We have to ascertain that we completely understand the problem and that there is no chance it will re-occur in flight and put us in jeopardy,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION> which gives final clearance for launch. The controller has two main channels, and it is in the backup channel that the problem occurred. The backup B channel would not be used unless there was a failure in the A channel. `` The worst condition is that we would shut down an engine and have to abort the flight and we want to make sure there is no probability of that,'' <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said. The five astronauts who are to fly Atlantis on the five-day mission received briefings Monday on the flight plan and status of the countdown. The anti-nuclear groups said earlier that if they lost in court they would attempt other means to stop the liftoff. `` We're going to attempt to put people on the launch pad if the court does n't prevent the launch,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagnon </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, one of the three groups that filed suit, said. After hearing the judge's ruling, he said, `` On our side, we're sad because the court did n't rule in our favor, but on the other side, we feel that we've succeeded in bringing the issue to the public that they are planning to put nuclear power in space ... We're going to go with our plan to put people on the launch pad.'' Reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough. `` We have patrols out in the area near the pad,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wistrand </PERSON>, deputy director of the space center's security office. `` We've installed various types of of tactical intrusion devices. Hopefully, if they try this tactic, we'll be able to detect and apprehend them before they are successful in getting to the pad.'' He also noted there are alligators and rattlesnakes in the swamps near the launch pad that could deter intruders.

 A Panamanian newspaper executive said Tuesday that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has stamped out freedom of the press and put <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> through `` the darkest moment in its history.'' `` Liberty of expression does not exist,'' <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, told the annual assembly of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Free journalism is incompatible with the regime of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The only hope of restoration is with the fall of <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON>.'' About 450 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> were meeting in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION> for the group's 45th general assembly. The organization's main objective is to protect freedom of the press. In other remarks, the owner of the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> said his daily may close its <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> office after the slaying Tuesday of two employees by traffickers angry about its anti-drug crusade. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> also said the entire 102-year-old newspaper may have to close eventually because of financial problems caused by the bombing of the main offices by drug traffickers last month. `` I do n't know if we'll be able to continue operating in the city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> under the circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION>'s editorial board. <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, the newspaper's administrator in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, was fatally shot in the neck in her car, police there reported. Her mother was injured in the shooting, which occurred at a traffic light. An hour later, the newspaper's circulation manager, <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Soler </PERSON>, was shot and killed near his home. Drug traffickers killed <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cano </PERSON>, in 1986. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION> has been singled out by the traffickers because it is `` frank ... and independent,'' said Cano, noticeably shaken by Tuesday's events. He said the company is trying to get bank loans to cover the estimated $ 2.5 million in damage caused by the bombing by drug traffickers last month. The newspaper needs financing within the next 60 days, he said, `` or we'll cease to exist.'' <PERSON> Cano </PERSON> said he would ask the journalists' organization to send a message to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government asking that journalists receive more protection. The group's press freedom committee released a resolution `` energetically condemning'' Tuesday's violence and asking the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government for `` quick action'' in capturing the attackers. Colombian traffickers have been warring with the government for nearly two months over a crackdown on drug lords. In his remarks, <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> was shut down and its offices remain occupied by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s troops. He said <PERSON> Panorama </PERSON> <PERSON> Catolico </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> newsletter circulated at Sunday Mass, is the only independent news medium still operating within <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Beliz </PERSON>, owner of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Siglo </ORGANIZATION>, was recently arrested, tortured and expelled to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON> said. `` In regard to the number of national and foreign journalists that have suffered beatings, jailing, torture, shootings and exile, the list is long and unending,'' he said. <PERSON> Eisenmann </PERSON> called for `` multinational cooperation'' in dealing with the Noriega-controlled government, which he called `` the first narco-military regime in the world.'' He did not give details of any plan, however. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> began his press crackdown in February 1988, when federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. He denies the charges. Since then, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Panamanian opposition groups have been trying to force him from power. A military coup against him failed last week.

 State lawmakers Tuesday convened a special session on abortion that drew thousands of chanting demonstrators and national attention, although the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s Democratic leaders predicted no new restrictions Republican Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> called the 3 -LCB- - day session soon after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in July upheld a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law giving the state more authority to regulate abortions <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s proposals include banning public financing and use of public resources for abortions, expanding regulations for abortion clinics, requiring viability tests on the fetuses of women who are at least 20 weeks pregnant and requiring physicians to tell women seeking abortions about the development of their fetuses. Both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> met for about a half-hour Tuesday and referred numerous bills, many of them abortion-related, to committees, which began work. In the first vote of the session, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected by a 9-3 vote a seven-day waiting period so a woman could undergo pre-abortion counseling. The panel also rejected by the same margin a ban on use of public funds, employees or facilities for abortions. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> defeated the first four bills Tuesday, proposals which would have pushed viability requirements from 24 to 20 weeks, ban public resources for abortion, create a state center to promote adoption as an alternative to abortion, and force women to wait a week and undergo counseling before having an abortion. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Malchon </PERSON>, predicted late Tuesday that four other bills her panel was scheduled to debate Wednesday will also be defeated. The House HRS committee, meanwhile, heard testimony but planned no action until later in the week. Despite widespread criticism by Democrats that the session will accomplish nothing and may result in unconstitutional law, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> repeated his view that the entire package should be considered. `` Having a hearing on each of these bills is important to the people of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` All of these, I think, deserve a good debate.'' As uniformed police closely guarded the doors to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chambers, pro-choice and anti-abortion demonstrators marched around the Capitol and chanted, putting forth their messages on their chests, in their songs and in the air. The pro-choice side sang `` America the Beautiful'' and had a banner-trailing airplane saying `` Keep Abortion Legal.'' Anti-abortion protesters wore a T-shirt saying, `` Spoken As a Former Fetus ... I'm Glad I'm Here. <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiracofe </PERSON> said two arrests were made Tuesday. A 14-year-old boy was charged with a misdemeanor because of a derogatory message on his jacket that referred to the governor, and 49-year-old <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlander </PERSON>, a pro-choice supporter, was jailed on a charge of aggravated battery after he allegedly struck a man in the face with a video camera. Police raised their estimate of people who attended the demonstration, from 8,000 people to between 10,000 and 11,000 people. There was plenty of jeering on both sides, but no other reports of violence. Inside, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, both Democrats, promised that both houses would give <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s proposals due consideration. There had been talk of ending the session a few minutes after it begins, but <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said that would n't happen. `` I think they'll all be considered,'' he said of the abortion proposals. `` We will abide by the rules of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and I will enforce those rules fairly.'' Both Democrats predicted no new restrictions on access to abortions, especially since the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled last week that the state's privacy law protects a woman's right to an abortion. The court knocked down as unconstitutional a 1988 parental-consent law for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> minors seeking abortions and protected women's abortion rights in the first trimester. `` If the effort is simply to restrict the ability to choose an abortion, that is not a generally well-received idea,'' <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said. `` The issue is can you really do anything in this area without violating privacy over and over and over again?'' Since his initial, more sweeping proposals, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has focused on enacting tougher health regulations on abortion clinics. Three <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> clinics have been closed in the last two weeks by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and Rehabilitative services after inspectors found unhealthy conditions. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> repeated Tuesday that he was not backing off but suggested that negotiations with legislators were focusing on the new clinic rules. `` Right now there is a lot of conversation about everything,'' the governor said. `` Our staff is leading discussions. We've got a full package out there. We're pushing all pieces of legislation.'' <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said they were not convinced tougher abortion clinic regulations were necessary, particularly since the state successfully closed the three clinics. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said the session could wind up as soon as Wednesday night, depending on what bills emerge from comittees. He said most legislators find the session difficult politically and morally and would like to finish as soon as possible. <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> agreed, saying, `` The sense I get from my members is that the sooner we can resolve the issues in front of us, the better they'd like it.''

<TEXT>
 The son of B-movie actress <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>, who was found bludgeoned to death nearly three years ago in her deteriorating home, was convicted Tuesday of involuntary manslaughter in his mother's killing. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, 25, was convicted in the death of <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>, 59, who appeared in such low-budget 1950s films as `` Wasp Woman,'' `` Machine Gun Kelly'' with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> and `` Tomahawk'' with <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, early in their careers. Roman's first attorney, <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, argued that <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>, who was born a dwarf, sustained brain damage from experiments to boost his growth. That first trial ended in a mistrial because <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> became ill. Roman was convicted on the same day defense and prosecution attorneys presented final arguments in a non-jury trial before Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Schempp </PERSON> Defense attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasting </PERSON> said he was pleased with the verdict because Roman originally had been charged with murder. Roman could receive up to four years in state prison when he is sentenced Nov. 29 in <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Cabot </PERSON>'s body was found Dec. 10, 1986, after Roman called police to the dilapidated <LOCATION> Encino </LOCATION> home they had shared. She had been bludgeoned with a barbell. Roman first told officers that he had been beaten unconscious by a man dressed as a Ninja warrior and awoke to find his mother slain. In court, he later admitted he `` made the whole story up'' and pleaded innocent by reason of insanity. In the second trial, Lasting argued that Roman's mother had a mental condition and that she had initiated the violence that led to her death.

 Hometown support for Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has dwindled markedly since he admitted employing a male prostitute he'd previously hired for sex, according to a survey published Tuesday. Of 300 registered voters polled, 74 percent said they would have voted for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> before the disclosure of his relationship with <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, but 56 percent of them said they now would vote to return him to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` If congressional elections were held last week, over one-half of <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s voters would choose to re-elect ... <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, but his hometown support has slipped significantly,'' The Tab weekly newspaper study concluded. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s district includes the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, his hometown. Sixteen percent of those polled Oct. 2 said they would not have voted for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> before the relationship was disclosed in August. That number grew to 23 percent following the disclosures, the survey said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> declined to comment Tuesday on the survey. Of the poll participants, 47 percent said they would not vote for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> because of his admitted poor judgment in his relationship with <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>; 19 percent cited <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s admission he hired a prostitute; and 7 percent noted his sexual preference. But 37 percent of those questioned said the above factors would not sway their votes, according to the poll conducted by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>. The telephone survey, with a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percent, questioned 132 registered Democrats, 134 Independent and non-affiliated voters and 36 Republicans. A spokeswoman for the local election commission said the breakdown for 46,582 registered voters as of April 1 was 23,109 Democrats, 18,203 Independent and non-affiliated voters and 5,270 Republicans. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a five-term <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman and outspoken liberal who was re-elected overwhelmingly in 1988 after disclosing his homosexuality, sent a letter to constitutents last month apologizing for `` some serious mistakes in judgment years ago.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader accused the White House Tuesday of trying to scuttle congressional talks aimed at ending the partisan stalemate over a Republican-backed plan to cut the capital gains tax. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders of both parties met for nearly two hours but reached no agreement in their dispute, which has delayed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> work on a deficit-reduction bill. Unless the budget-cutting measure is passed by Monday, spending cuts in many defense and domestic programs will be automatically triggered by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. The bargaining, which began last week, resumed as congressional experts estimated the size of the spending cuts that would occur Monday. Their non-binding estimate: $ 41.3 billion, out of a $ 1.2 trillion budget. The sticking point in the deficit-reduction talks has been GOP efforts to have the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on a plan to reduce the capital gains tax rate, which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to fight for during his election campaign. Leaders of both parties have been maneuvering for parliamentary advantages in how that vote will occur. They have been exploring ways to keep the capital gains cut _ along with other controversial provisions _ from being attached to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 14 billion deficit-reduction bill, which is considered must-pass legislation. Asked Tuesday if the administration would accept a stripped-down deficit-cutting measure in exchange for a separate <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on capital gains later, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We believe the capital gains provision should be a part'' of the bill. After Tuesday's meeting of congressional leaders, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>'s comments had `` complicated'' the talks. `` It appears that the White House is intent on torpedoing this discussion,'' he said. He added, `` The administration does n't really care about the deficit.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week approved its own $ 11 billion deficit-reduction bill that contained a two-year capital gains tax cut, an extension of child-care programs, a rollback of Medicare benefits for elderly people with serious, long-term diseases, and other controversial provisions. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provision would make the maximum capital gains tax rate 19.6 percent for two years, instead of the current maximum of 28 percent -LRB- 33 percent for some taxpayers -RRB-. Democrats and Republicans agree that slimming down that bill _ and figuring out a way to deal with the numerous initiatives in contains _ is such a difficult task that avoiding the Gramm-Rudman cuts is all but impossible. `` You're not going to avoid'' the automatic cuts, said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` I think we're all pretty much in agreement on that.'' The Gramm-Rudman cuts will be triggered Monday if the projected deficit for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 is not below $ 110 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> projected Tuesday that the shortfall will be $ 141.3 billion, necessitating cuts of $ 41.3 billion, divided evenly between defense and domestic programs. The office said many domestic programs would take a 10.7 percent cut and many defense programs would take a 15.6 percent cut. Some programs in both areas are exempt from spending reductions under Gramm-Rudman. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> projections are merely advisory. The White House's Office of Management and Budget issues its binding projections Monday They are expected to require about $ 16 billion in cuts, divided equally between defense and domestic programs.

 <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> broke off its $ 1.5 billion merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and said it will sue the Australian media conglomerate for breach of contract and fraud. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors voted to cancel the buyout because <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Australia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> failed to deliver a $ 50 million letter of credit as required last month, <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbakow </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We have done everything we possibly could,'' <PERSON> Barbakow </PERSON> said. `` We really wanted this deal and we did everything we possibly could to hold it together and come up with an approach that they could perform under. And they could n't work it out. `` Obviously, we are looking at all our alternatives, which could include a sale'' to another party, <PERSON> Barbakow </PERSON> said. The film and television studio, subject to an intense bidding war that spanned almost two years, said it would bring a $ 50 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> in federal court alleging breach of contract, fraud and other damages. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> was to have delivered the irrevocable letter of credit for $ 50 million by Sept. 22, one week after <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> outbid media mogul <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> by $ 100 million. `` Almost every day, <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> assured us that the letter of credit would be immediately forthcoming. We believe it is now clear that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> repeatedly misled us regarding its ability to furnish the letter of credit,'' <PERSON> Barbakow </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Barbakow </PERSON>'s allegations, saying in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Brisbane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> dated Oct. 11 that <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> had unlawfully terminated the agreement <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> said in his letter that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> had met the terms for the letter of credit but <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> asked for `` additional letters of credit and substantial liquidated damages.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Saks </PERSON>, a spokesman retained by <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION>, said that <PERSON> Skase </PERSON> would not elaborate on the remarks made in the letter. <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> is an operator of resorts and an Australian commercial TV network. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s assets include a film production and marketing company, a domestic film distribution unit, a one-third interest in a worldwide film distribution company, an international TV distribution concern and <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> home video. The deal was valued at $ 1.5 billion. Including the <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> junk-bond debt that <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> would have assumed, the total deal would have cost <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> $ 1.9 billion.

 An investigation is under way into the cause of a fire in an electrical transformer and generator at the <ORGANIZATION> Shearon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION>, officials said Tuesday. The fire was in a structure separate from the plant's reactor. `` It did not involve any of the nuclear portions of the plant,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He said a fire prevention specialist and an electrical engineer would work with the <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to try to determine the cause. Company officials said the fire Monday night did not pose a threat to the public. No one was injured. `` Since the fire was located on the steam side of the plant in the turbine deck and at the transformer, it remained external to the concrete buildings which house the nuclear systems of the plant,'' said R.B. <PERSON> Richey </PERSON>, nuclear project manager. `` At no time was there any danger to the public.'' The turbine deck is about 300 feet from the reactor building. <ORGANIZATION> CP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L spokeswoman <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> said hydrogen gas leaked when the fire spread through lines running from one of three transformers to a generator. She said there was a hydrogen gas fire, but there was no explosion. Ms. <PERSON> Bean </PERSON> said officials do n't know whether the fire started in the generator, which uses hydrogen gas as a cooling agent, or in the transformer. The fire was reported about 11:20 p.m. The fire was completely out and the hydrogen leak was contained by 2:43 a.m. today, CP & amp; L officials said. The <PERSON> Fuquay </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Holly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> fire departments were called to the scene at the plant, which is located 15 miles southwest of the Raleigh city limits. Because of damage to equipment, the plant was closed for a refueling outage scheduled to begin next week, the company said. Refueling, inspection and maintenance are expected to keep the plant down for eight to 10 weeks. The nuclear plant began commercial operations in May 1987. The $ 3.9 billion, 900-megawatt plant has one nuclear reactor. The plant is 15 miles southwest of the city limits.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it expects to receive a patent this week for a genetic engineering process that has revolutionized medical and agricultrual research. The `` DNA microinjection process'' was developed by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, a molecular geneticist at the university, and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON>, a researcher at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Bar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Microinjection is a microsurgical technique in which genetic material with a new, desirable trait is injected into an embryo shortly after fertilizaion. It is being used to develop genetically modified animals that could boost agricultural production and improve medical and pharmaceutical research and manufacturing. In microinjection, the developing embryo incorporates the new gene into its genetic makeup, passing on the improved trait to future generations of so-called `` transgenic'' animals. `` Transgenic animals are emerging as a fundamental tool in medical and pharmaceutical research and product development, chemical safety testing and in the improvement of the health and value of livestock animals,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, N.J.-based <ORGANIZATION> DNX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the only business licensed by the univeristy to use the process. `` Since the patent covers a fundamental and widely used technology, we expect to establish a broad commercial licensing program,'' he said. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoppe </PERSON> assigned the patent to <ORGANIZATION> OU </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s royalties will go to the <ORGANIZATION> OU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which supports research by the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biotechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> is director of the center. In 1981, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> led a team first that used the technique to transfer a gene for rabbit hemoglobin _ the material in red blood cells that carries oxygen thoughout the body _ into a mouse embryo, passing rabbit blood traits to the mouse. Pigs, rats, mice, goats and other animals have since been altered using the technique. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> was first interested in the concept for boosting agricultural production, such as by producing cows that give more milk or animals that are disease-resistant. He said there is even more potential in medical research, including development of mice and other research animals that can develop human diseases such as diabetes, hepatitis or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and can be used to test medications. Sheep have been bio-engineered to produce milk carrying a vital human blood clotting factor that hemophiliacs need, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said. Mice have been altered to produce milk containing TPA, a protein prescribed for heart attack victims. The process works because it is natural for chromosomes, the cell's long strands of genes, to be damaged. While the cell repairs itself, the foreign genetic material is incorporated into chromosomes. The altered egg is then implanted into a surrogate mother. <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said DNA microinjection was the technique employed by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Leder </PERSON> to develop the first patented transgenic animal, the `` Harvard mouse.'' <PERSON> Microinjection </PERSON> also is used in the development of improved livestock, much of which is done by <ORGANIZATION> DNX </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> DNX </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1984 as the <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s private-sector partner to develop commercial applications of prototype organisms produced by OU scientists.

 <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leaders jailed 25 years ago with <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> will be freed unconditionally soon, but <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> will remain in prison, President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Tuesday. They are among eight aging, longtime prisoners <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said would be released to `` contribute to the spirit of reconciliation which is presently evident in our country.'' He said <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, regarded by many black <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> as their leader, was told of the proposed releases in advance. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, spokesman for the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> anti-apartheid alliance, was with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> at his home on the <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Verster </PERSON> prison farm north of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> when the releases were announced on state television. `` Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> said he would greatly enjoy his sleep tonight after all his efforts to secure their release,'' Morobe said, and quoted <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as saying to South Africans: `` The people are going to be greatly endowed by the leadership who are coming out of jail.'' <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION> and a few other black anti-apartheid leaders were at the Mandela house, including <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, wife of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s close friend and <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> colleague, the 77-year-old <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, a leading political strategist of the banned <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cassim </PERSON> <PERSON> Saloojee </PERSON>, a member of the group, read a statement from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 71, saying `` My release is not an issue at this stage.'' <PERSON> Saloojee </PERSON> added: `` His deepest concern is that all the other comrades be released.'' In <LOCATION> Blackpool </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> welcomed the announcement of the releases, calling it `` a major step in the right direction.'' The releases had been expected as ammunition for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> to use at the forthcoming <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> summit against imposing further economic sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The summit, in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, begins Oct. 18. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> acknowledged the decision was `` taken against the background of requests and representations from various sources over a long period.'' He said the views of moderate blacks, including leaders of tribal homelands whom the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejects, had `` carried special weight.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is to meet in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> with three of the most prominent black South African clergymen: Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>; the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>; and the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Council of Churches. They have said they want to establish before the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> conference whether <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> `` is serious about dismantling apartheid and entering negotiations to bring about a truly democratic <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' After the release announcement was broadcast, <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said: `` This was one item. The greater part of the agenda has to do with creating a climate conducive to negotiation. `` If we do not get a clear indication of what Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is going to do, and his aim is just to release leaders to come and live in an apartheid society, then we will continue calling for sanctions in this country.'' <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said he understood <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s position `` that his release is not the critical thing. His release without a package to end the apartheid system would be meaningless. I understand him to be saying his release can not be a substitute for the freedom of the people.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said the men would be freed `` as soon as the necessary formalities can be dealt with, which can take some time.'' A prison official said privately the process can take from an hour to two weeks. According to the president, `` all relevant factors were brought into consideration, including the fact that most of these prisoners had already served many, many years of their sentences and are already advanced in years. ... A favorable climate currently exists in which the release can take place.'' The most prominent prisoner on the list is <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, who ran day-to-day operations of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> as its secretary-general in 1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign. He was sentenced to life in June 1964, along with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and other leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s internal military wing, for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the white goverment. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> already had spent two years in prison. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s other co-defendants to be freed are <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathrada </PERSON>, 60; <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mlangeni </PERSON>, 63; <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Motsoaledi </PERSON>, 65; and <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mhlaba </PERSON>, 69. <PERSON> Wilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkwayi </PERSON>, 66, who briefly took command of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> military wing, Spear of the Nation, after <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s co-defendants were arrested in July 1963, is to be released from a life term he received after a separate trial in 1964. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s announcement also named <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, an 80-year-old, partially blind diabetic with one leg who has spent most of his five-year prison term in the hospital and was due for release next year. <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON>, the country's oldest political prisoner, was the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> province and, during the appeal of his terrorism sentence in 1983, was elected a co-president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. The judge said he did not want to send <PERSON> Mpetha </PERSON> to prison but that the Terrorism Act, since repealed, required it. No information was immediately available on the eighth man, <PERSON> Jafta </PERSON> <PERSON> Masemula </PERSON>. Two other co-defendants of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, were freed previously. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, the only white convicted in the trial, was deported in 1985. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> was released two years ago in what the government said was a test case for the possible release of <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION>. He was banned from speaking in public, talking to the press or leaving his hometown, even though the government said his release was unconditional.

 An electrician who fell 12 stories through a glass atrium and into a basement cafeteria died in a hospital Tuesday. <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, 24, had just finished changing the neon on a sign atop Medical Center Tower I and was gathering equipment when the accident occurred early Monday afternoon. `` He backed right over the edge of the building,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilough </PERSON>. <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON> already had removed a safety harness and was walking backward, gathering rope, when he stepped off the roof and plummeted through the glass ceiling of a four-story atrium.

<HEAD>Jane's Says More Effective NATO Battlefield Weapons Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> must improve the effectiveness of its conventional weapons to counter the vastly superior number of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact troops and advances in Soviet technology, according to a <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s reference book published Wednesday. Editors <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> of `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Battlefield Surveillance Systems'' said the superpower agreement to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is a major step toward greater reductions in nuclear weapons by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But they warned that `` as important as it is to the continuing peace process, the INF carries with it some serious concerns for both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies. `` <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces are already vastly superior numerically to those of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, and this advantage in numbers is further enhanced by the recent rapid growth in Soviet technology.'' The editors said in the preface that despite the new Soviet policies of openness and economic reform, `` the post-INF climate must not allow complacency to override vigilance.'' `` On the contrary, the current imbalance of conventional forces demands nothing less of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> than a major improvement in the battle management effectiveness of its conventional weapons, and the key to this is constant, round-the-clock surveillance.'' <PERSON> Hooton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Munson </PERSON> said the dangers of inefficient or inadequate battlefield surveillance were demonstrated all too clearly in July when a pilotless Soviet MiG fighter plane flew halfway across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before crashing in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The Soviets said their radar operators were distracted by a military flight exercise and failed to notice the plane that flew across <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> after the pilot ejected into the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. `` Not until the runaway was, literally, eyeballed by a Dutch-based pair of <ORGANIZATION> USAF </ORGANIZATION> F-15 pilots, after a 21-minute air search, did a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ground station become fully aware of the true situation,'' the editors said. `` This time the overflight was accidental; but what if, next time, it is not?'' They said surveillance equipment to detect thermal heat from soldiers and equipment, even when concealed by darkness, mist and battlefield smoke, is being developed. However, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to decide which of three such systems being developed by its member countries it should use, they said. The new generation of airborne battlefield surveillance radars will reduce the likelihood of a surprise attack on the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, but will not prevent it, the editors added.

<HEAD>Environmental Ballot Issue Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Environmentalists and prominent state Democrats on Tuesday proposed a sweeping environmental protection initiative for the 1990 state ballot. The key goals are a phase-out of cancer-causing pesticides, reducing gases and chemicals that cause the global warming, and protecting the coast with tough water standards and oil-spill prevention and cleanup measures. `` This is a moment in history when we are waking up to the reality that we are killing ourselves,'' Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> told a news conference to unveil the Environmental Protection Initiative of 1990. The drafting committee included members of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voters </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toxics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> and the Citizens for a Better Environment. The committee also included <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON>, who is running for governor, <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, and a representative of Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s office. `` The point of the initiative is to end what we consider to be a decade of environmental neglect and begin a decade of environmental action through programs for preserving a clean ocean, clean food, clean atmosphere and a clean government,'' <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON> said. The group plans to begin collecting signatures next month to get the issue on the ballot. The initiative would create an elected statewide office of environmental advocate to make certain <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s environmental laws are observed. Among other aspects, it would create a $ 300 million bond program for acquiring ancient redwood forests and to fund reforestation efforts. The initiative's advocates say it would protect the state's food supply by phasing out cancer-causing pesticides by 1996 and by making regulatory agencies require improved chemicals by 1997. The initiative would protect the coastline with tough, health-based standards for discharge of toxic pollutants into state waters. It would also require public sewage treatment plants to meet federal Clean Water Act standards by 2000. A $ 500 million fund for prevention and clean up of oil spills would be established, and on that same front, the initiative would create a spill prevention policy allowing drilling leases within the three-mile state limit only in the event of a national energy emergency.

 President and Mrs. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a performance of the Joffrey Ballet at the Kennedy Center Tuesday night that included the world premiere of a balletic salute to vaudeville commissioned in honor of the presidency.

 Communist officials met opposition leaders in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and talks were expected soon in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> in the first sign of a shift in the East German government's hard-line stance, news reports said Tuesday. Prominent Lutheran official <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Furian </PERSON> meanwhile said in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` must give up its grip on total power.'' Also in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, pro-democracy activists said at least 500 protesters arrested in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> were freed the past two days. The activists, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said those freed were among about 1,000 people arrested in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> during demonstrations last week and over the weekend. The activists did not say if any of the demonstrators faced charges. Officials in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> have said all demonstrators not involved in violence will be released. Some Communist Party officials showed increasing signs of willingness Tuesday to talk with pro-democracy activists. But East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> reiterated his hard-line position. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> seemed to hold out a carrot of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic aid Tuesday if East Germany follows the reform path of its neighbors. In an interview on `` CBS Evening News,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` It's time for perestroika -LRB- reforms -RRB- to come to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' `` We're prepared to assist economically, improve our relations with those countries that do move forward toward political pluralism and to more of an open society from an economic standpoint. `` We simply hope that countries like <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will opt for that approach rather than moving backwards to the approach that's failed communist regimes in the past, the approach of repression by force. Conflicting reports emerged as to whether the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> had taken up a dialogue with the central government or whether the contacts remained on the local level. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network, quoting high-level church sources, said talks about the unrest `` had begun with central offices'' in the East German government. It did not elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> said talks between local Communist leaders in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and pro-democracy activists also are set to begin. It gave no timetable. Talks between Communist officials and opposition activists already have been held in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. Communist officials in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> first met with opposition leaders on Monday. Mayor <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Berghofer </PERSON> said another meeting was scheduled for next week. The 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has given no indication he is about to change his hard-line ways. In a meeting Monday with Chinese Vice Prime Minister <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> repeated allegations that Western `` imperialists'' are poised to threaten his country. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> recalled the events of June in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, when troops crushed a pro-democracy movement. `` In this respect, there is a fundamental lesson to be learned from the counterrevolutionary revolt in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the present defamation campaign against the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- and other Socialist states,'' the East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s statement appeared to signal a willingness to crush dissent, if necessary. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolpe </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, earlier Tuesday denied a West German radio report that said high-level talks had been held between church leaders and government officials in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. But he said `` working groups'' did exist on several levels to discuss the current situation. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Christof </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziemer </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said topics discussed were election reforms, travel restrictions and release of those arrested during demonstrations. The events in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> were the first significant sign of any breakthrough in the country's hard-line stance, although <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state media ran lengthy commentaries Tuesday denouncing the unrest and accusing many of the demonstrators of having `` lengthy criminal backgrounds.'' <PERSON> Hans-Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sievers </PERSON>, a Lutheran pastor in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, said in a West German radio interview he believed the decision by <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> officials to work for dialogue `` was certainly not made alone without discussions with others.'' But he said it was too soon to tell whether that might signal a change in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s course. Several of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s most influential party leaders signed a declaration Monday saying they would work for a dialogue between the government and opposition groups. Among the signatories was <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Woetzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief and his top ideologue, <PERSON> Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pommert </PERSON>. No violence was reported Monday night in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, when 70,000 demonstrators paraded in the country's largest single pro-democracy protest since a 1953 uprising was put down by Soviet troops. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ruling Politburo also met Tuesday for the first time since the demonstrations. It was the first Politburo meeting since Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> to undertake reforms during a lengthy meeting in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Saturday. At least 50,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS grafs 12-13, `The Disciplinary ..., to CORRECT spelling

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Because lawyers <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenhach </PERSON> hid a broken rifle butt in a 1982 murder case, lawyers in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> today have clearer guidelines for handling evidence that could hurt their clients. For their trouble, the <PERSON> Stenhach </PERSON> brothers have tarnished reputations and a wounded law practice to rehabilitate. But at least they do n't have criminal records or jail sentences. `` Hopefully this is the end of it, and we can get on with our lives,'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenhach </PERSON> said. The men from <LOCATION> Coudersport </LOCATION> spoke at a news conference Monday, after the deadline had passed for the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to try to have them disbarred. The Stenhachs were defending <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> against a first-degree murder charge in 1982 when <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> told them where to find the butt of the murder weapon. `` If we turned it over to prosecutors, we would be accused of ineffective counsel,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenhach </PERSON>, 38. `` If we did not, it would be withholding evidence.'' The brothers decided that turning over the evidence would violate their client's rights. They kept the butt in their office. The judge in <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>'s trial learned about the rifle butt and ordered the Stenhachs to surrender it, which they did. It was never entered as evidence. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> was convicted of third-degree murder. The Stenhachs were arrested 10 months later on charges of conspiracy, tampering with evidence and hindering prosecution. They were convicted and each was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $ 750. <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned the conviction in 1986, saying the laws were too vague. The court ruled, however, that defense attorneys must turn over physical evidence although prosecutors may not tell the jury where the evidence came from. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling stand in 1987, but in April 1987 the court's Office of Disciplinary Counsel charged the men with seven violations of the professional code. The Disciplinary Board dismissed the charges, saying the Stenhachs `` have suffered greatly yet with humble dignity. We believe that they have acted in a manner entirely consistent with the highest standards of this profession.'' `` Throughout the whole thing, my brother and I always had a gut feeling, a good feeling, we would be exonerated, and that kind of helped us through,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stenhach </PERSON>, 33. The dilemma the <PERSON> Stenhachs </PERSON> faced is `` one lawyers think about a lot during law school and hope they never confront during practice,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingess </PERSON>, one of 10 lawyers from <ORGANIZATION> Kirkpatrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Lockhart </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> who donated their time to help the Stenhachs. The <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defenders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> also supported the brothers.

 Consumers may soon be paying higher prices for prescription drugs as more generic products are pulled from the market and cost-conscious buyers are left with fewer low-priced options, some industry observers say. Dozens of drugs have been recalled in the wake of allegations and admissions of cheating on safety tests required for <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> approval. The scandal is likely to produce a shakeout in the industry and result in more rigorous safety testing required for approval. Some generic drug makers and industry observers say this will force prices up, but others say the industry will remain competitive enough to withstand the financial pressures without price increases. A more immediate concern for consumers, however, is the possible effect of the recalls.

 The millions of elderly Americans moving to new retirement homes do n't arrive empty-handed, say researchers who calculate that states like <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> wind up billions of dollars to the good.

<HEAD>`The Road To War' Historical Series Premieres on Cable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's said that those who forget history are doomed to watch it on cable. That is n't all bad. And if you're up for a first-rate new history series, tune in tonight to the debut of `` The Road To War.'' Airing on the A & amp; E Network, this eight-part series, a co-production of A & amp; E and the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, studies the origins of World War II in the two decades that preceded <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in September 50 years ago. What makes this `` Road'' different from previous series about the war, such as the excellent `` The World at War,'' is that it examines the social and political events leading to World War II in each major nation involved. Each nation gets a separate, one-hour look. In order of appearance, they are <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, with the final chapter entitled `` Global War,'' a summing-up of sorts. Another plus: As tonight's opening `` <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'' shows, the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> team has gone to extraordinary lengths not only to unearth rarely seen newsreel and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> propaganda footage, but also appears to have struck new, crisp-looking prints of them and restored as much as possible their sound tracks. All that gives a strange sense of immediacy when woven in with interviews of now-elderly Germans _ military men, diplomats, civilians, even a benign-looking former Nazi storm trooper. They witnessed <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rise to power, many met him, and, in the case of one Socialist member of the Reichstag in 1932-33, went to a concentration camp because of him. Older viewers will find familiar the documentary's re-telling of how <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s sufferings after its defeat in World War I led to the political triumphs of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then his persecution and murder of Jews, his lust for domination and war. But regardless of the age of the viewer, this chapter is still a valuable history lesson, one made striking with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> `` newsreel'' footage that includes: _ Shots of storm troopers at night burning what a Nazi narrator calls `` un-German and immoral books.'' _ Pictures of fleeing refugees, identified as as `` ethnic Germans ... being driven out of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'' _ the scenes staged to incite German support of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s propaganda, his claim that he had cause to invade <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. There's brilliant editing, too, in `` <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' particularly then-and-now scenes of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The contrasts are made as one hears old recordings of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s frenzied speeches after his `` unification'' of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1938. It's also very, very eerie and unsettling to hear a well-dressed, obviously educated, now-60ish witness of those times in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, explain in her soft, matter-of-fact way, why she and others there supported <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. One reason, she says without apparent shame or regret, `` was all about the Jews ...'' It gets worse as she continues, saying, `` first of all, it was their behavior, and their appearance ... they really did n't belong to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, in a way.'' Incredible.

 <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> had something in common with <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Both were in charge of programs to help the poor. Both got a lot of criticism for the way they ran them. In the case of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s housing secretary, critics have said the poor people were n't getting the help. In the case of <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, the trouble was that they were getting the help, and critics of <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> did n't like it <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s troubles have been in the news recently as congressional investigators probe his administration of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s housing subsidy programs. The story of <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, the social worker who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and later became <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s most trusted wartime aide, is told tonight in a 90-minute PBS documentary airing at 9 p.m. EDT. `` <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> kept the WPA free of scandal and became one of the most vilified public servants in modern times,'' narrator <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> says. Businessmen said the New Deal agency undermined the morals of workers and created boondoggles for the lazy. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said if he deserved any criticism it was `` that I did n't do enough when I had the chance'' to help the down and out. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION>, who appears on the program, said in an interview, `` There is a difference between having idealists in government and having people who are there either to promote their own careers or to make contacts so they can make more money after their government service. Idealists have many faults, but they rarely steal.'' Among others who reminisce about <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> on the documentary is the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., a young senator in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deal </LOCATION> days, who talked to the filmmakers in one of his last interviews `` You never heard of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> trying to make any money, getting Roosevelt to approve some project over there, getting some fellow a contract. He would n't any more have asked for that than he would have asked for the Lord to come down in person,'' says Pepper. <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON>, who met <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> when she was <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>'s daughter-in-law and <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> came on a wartime mission to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, is interviewed on the program, for which two <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON> family foundations provided part of the funding. She said the foundations took no part in planning for the documentary, but were called on for help when the producers needed to send three staff members to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to obtain Soviet newsreel footage. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> had a brusque manner and a talent for getting at the heart of things, which prompted <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> to tell him jocularly that the British crown was going to name him `` Lord Root of the Matter.'' The producers originally chose this for the title, but dropped it in favor of the more down-to-earth: `` <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>: At <ORGANIZATION> FDR </ORGANIZATION>'s Side. `` You know, people today, the young, do n't know who <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> is,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON> said. `` And he really was a giant, that tiny little man, and he did a yeoman's job.''

<HEAD>Who Says Corporations Need Big Debts?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 At a time when many corporations have loaded up on high-cost debt in the form of junk bonds, eight large concerns stand out from the field. Over the past decade, they have had almost no long-term debt. All are successful companies, too, and their success is recognized in the stock market by relatively high price-earnings ratios. That is, investors are willing to pay a premium for shares of these debt-free companies. The significance of low corporate debt rises whenever the economy is thought to be facing a period of falling corporate profits, because low-debt companies generally are in a better position to survive. In contrast, high-debt companies, especially those loaded with costly junk bonds, face greater dangers during a time of lower corporate profits, because it takes cash to paythose high-interest charges. The eight companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Crown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cork </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Seal, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flavors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Fragrances, <ORGANIZATION> Longs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tambrands </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tootsie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> <PERSON> Markets </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrigley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> _ are the stars of a larger grouping. These eight emerged from a study by mathematician <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, who screened <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> listings on one variable: companies whose long-term debt over the past 10 years averaged less than 5 percent of capital. He found only 34. <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> is head of <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-based company he founded after leaving college teaching. It publishes an array of investment information, including <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Values </ORGANIZATION>, a 17-issues-a-year newsletter. It was for that publication, obviously conservative, that he sought the lowest-debt companies. <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> is hardly a purist; he recognizes that in expanding economies a company leveraged with debt might do very well. But among other things, he also wanted to show that companies can succeed with low debt. The 34 companies have done very well and investors know it, the proof of which is their willingness to pay a premium. The average price-earnings ratio of the group is 17 times the previous year's earnings, well above the norm Not only is that multiple higher than most <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> stocks, it also applies to companies that must pay very low dividends _ about 2 percent on average late this year _ simply because they finance growth from within. To his surprise, <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> found five of the 34 _ The GAP, Longs, H & amp; R Block, <LOCATION> Melville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Weis </PERSON> _ are retailers, a category that usually borrows heavily to finance real estate investments or long-term leases. While <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> demonstrates that growth can be obtained without large debt, there is little mystery to the popularity of junk bonds, temporary though that popularity might be. Corporate borrowers like the quick capital that junk bonds raise. Buyers like the high returns. And, judging from the tax code, Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> likes to lend his support to the idea. The latter's involvement in junk bonds is seldom noted, but it is there, allowing issuers to lower their costs through tax deductions. For a company paying 40 percent combined state-federal tax, a 13 percent cost becomes 7.8 percent. That latter rate, observes analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is low enough to make debt bearable for the corporation. And from the investor viewpoint, the 13 percent rate is higher than the long-term return on stocks. But still, as <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> points out, debt is n't a necessity for corporate performance _ or for investor performance either.

 <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> almost did n't play <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` The Final Days'' because, through a misunderstanding, he was asked to read for another role. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> portrays the former president during the Watergate crisis that led to his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.

He pulled his pants up above his waist. `` I noticed that he wore his pants high,'' he said. `` His jacket was always buttoned and he often had his hand on his hip.'' He demonstrated and suddenly he was transformed into <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. `` Once I had that I was able to get on to the emotions,'' he said. `` I saw him as a man who had suffered a great loss. I was n't concerned about the politics What concerned me was: How did he get through this dilemma? I tried to make him a human being.'' Two clues gave <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> `` the key to the man,'' he said. `` I looked at his resignation speech and thought it was a little bizarre. <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> gave me the clue. He'd talked to people who had been there. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> had finally taken off his mask and showed himself as vulnerable and suffering. And when he got down on his knees with <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, I think that process restored him to his roots. So, having those clues, I was able to portray him.'' <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> has protested the portrayals in `` The Final Days,'' which tells of his last days in the White House. In a letter to sponsor <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, his spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the company should change its slogan to `` Reach Out and Smear Someone.''

<TEXT>
 One day on the set of `` On Golden Pond,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> was standing in front of a mirror combing her hair, when she felt co-star <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> reach over and tug at her cheek. `` How do you feel about this?'' <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> asked, peering from behind. `` This is your box that carries your persona. What do you want this to be?'' Image is what <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> meant. What kind of a person does a face suggest? <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> did n't have a ready answer, even though neutrality is impossible for this self-styled crusader. At age 51, she's still in training. Memoirs do n't interest her. A house in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> will have to wait _ there's too much to do. Her outlook remains shaped by possibility, and by now her public knows that it's never too late for a new <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. `` It literally does n't occur to people, maybe even women more than men because women do n't have as many options for change, that you can become very, very different, and it's never too late and it can be very profound,'' she said in a recent interview. `` You just have to stay open to life and not allow yourself to settle in. Anything can happen. I feel fortunate that I have this characteristic of openness. `` People say, ` Have you fulfilled your dreams?' I never had any dreams. My projections of the future were maybe I'd OD at 25 and end up lonely and self-destructive. I never had dreams, I never expected anything, so everything was a surprise to me.'' Relaxed Jane: She sat on a sofa at the Regency Hotel in jeans and blue flannel shirt, occasionally resting her black booted feet on a coffee table and nibbling chocolates. She talked about open participation and activism. Something's wrong Well, let's form a committee, organize, protest. Do something! Get involved! It starts with each of us. We can change the world! No wonder a special screening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of her new film, `` Old Gringo,'' was a benefit for the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and co-star <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> were there. So were the Kennedys: <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. Wealth, glamour, power and idealism: <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Kennedys </PERSON>. Feasts for the tabloids. The latest? The drug bust of <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON>, the daughter <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> had with her first husband, French filmmaker <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON>. The 21-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student was arrested Oct. 6 with a friend, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Feegal </PERSON>, outside a reputed drug den in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. At her arraignment, she pleaded innocent to obstructing governmental administration, loitering for the purpose of purchasing drugs and disorderly conduct. Patrician Jane: She was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1937, the daughter of a highly respected film actor, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, and his wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>, a descendant of Lady <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, a wife of King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>. She committed suicide in 1953 although her children were told it was a heart attack. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> learned the truth a year later from a gossip magazine. Her brother, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, also went into movies, leaving a testament to the 1960s with the haunting `` Easy Rider.'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> went to private schools on both coasts and wound up partying at <ORGANIZATION> Vassar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. Unsure of a career in acting, her confidence grew in the late'50s under the guidance of Method acting guru <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON>. Thespian Jane: There was Broadway and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the early'60s. She had great reviews in bad shows, but her career was going nowhere. She escaped to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and made <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON>'s `` La Ronde'' in 1964, a vulgarization of the 1950 classic about love and sex starring <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Signoret </PERSON>. She and <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> married a year later. Sex Kitten Jane: She was dubbed `` La BB Americaine'' by the French press, a reference to <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardot </PERSON>, who was once married to <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON>. Among <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s roles over the next three years: a woman who seduces her stepson -LRB- `` La Curee'' -RRB-, a business executive's mistress -LRB- `` Any Wednesday'' -RRB- and an erotic space maiden who takes on a sex robot and wins -LRB- `` Barbarella'' -RRB-. <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Jane: In 1968, around the time of `` Barbarella,'' students in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> nearly toppled the government, and opposition at home to the Vietnam War overflowed. At first, she defended the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' involvement, but soon changed her mind _ completely `` I've taken many paths; I've broken all the rules,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` I left <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> and went to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the time when I should n't have. I came back, not as an actress, but as an activist.'' Nearly 20 years later, her celebrated visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, when she appeared on Radio <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> and begged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers to stop the bombings, still is n't completely forgotten. Last year, a <LOCATION> Waterbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, vet tried to circulate bumper stickers that read, `` I'm Not Fond' a <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Jane,'' while the actress was there filming `` Stanley and <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>'' with <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> apologized last year on national television to veterans who may have been hurt by her actions, but her effort at reconciliation was rejected by both the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. And her name is still invoked by conservatives in political campaigns: `` Do you want <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> running this country?'' `` I'm a good scapegoat,'' she said. `` I can be painted in to an image which causes a lot of hostility. I may not be that person but that's irrelevant.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and Jane: She divorced <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> in 1970, and met activist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayden </PERSON>, a founding member of the radical Students for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. She married him three years later, and they had a son, Troy, now 16. They separated earlier this year. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>: `` Fun With <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'' was a 1976 satire with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON>. But in real life `` <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'' meant President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and the `` enemies list,'' a collection of actors, authors and activists deemed subversive by the administration. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> was in the elite: wiretapping, harassment of friends, a failed drug bust and agents reporting on <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON>'s kindergarten class. `` Sometimes, I literally feel like somebody who walks through a field of gunfire and does n't get hit,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` I do n't shy away from ambushes and I do n't particularly have any armor. I just go through it and the shots miss me. It's not like I'm protecting myself. I just live my life and I do n't think about it.''

 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION>: `` ... about it.'' Oscar Jane: Politics and all, <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> honored <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>. In 1969, she earned an Academy Award nomination for her role as a Depression-era marathon dancer in `` They Shoot Horses, Do n't They?'' Two years later, when she won the best actress <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> as a prostitute in `` Klute,'' she gave a surprisingly subdued acceptance speech and snubbed the traditional Governors' Ball. `` I have not bought in to my celebrity,'' she said in the interview. `` I'm not a snob, I do n't just like people who are famous My friends are n't famous. I do n't live like a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> star. `` Everybody could n't believe my father and <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Hepburn </PERSON> did n't know each other _ as if <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> is this little community where everybody knows each other. Very often, father was quite reclusive.'' She won the actress trophy again in 1978 for `` Coming Home.'' There were other Oscar nominations for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s political princess: actress in `` Julia'' -LRB- ting actress in `` On Golden Pond'' -LRB- r981 -RRB-. Capitalist Jane: In 1977, <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and producer <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> formed <ORGANIZATION> Indochina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION>, an independent company that would make `` thought-provoking and commercial'' films. Two of their projects, `` On Golden Pond'' and `` Nine to Five,'' each grossed over $ 100 million. `` I have an instinct for what's happening,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` I've only had one failure _ ` Rollover' was the only film that did n't work I do n't know, it's timing, timing. ` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Syndrome,' then Three Mile Island. ` Nine to Five.' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretaries </ORGANIZATION> formed right after it. ` On Golden Pond,' my dad was going to die. ` Coming Home,' the first real film about vets.'' Deltoid Jane: In the late'70s, the onetime revolutionary empress became a leotard liberal with her entry into the fitness market. Today, she has eight videos on the market, and all have been in the Top 20 selling videocassettes. It began in 1979 with a fitness studio in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. Two years later, `` <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s Workout Book'' was in the stores with more than a million copies in hard cover alone. The video is the biggest seller ever, earning close to $ 40 million. Did she worry that her movie career would be forgotten? `` In the very beginning I did, because when I started the workout business I was not making many movies,'' she said. `` I thought that might overtake the other. But I realized pretty quickly it was n't the case And even if it did, I am pretty much someone who lives not according to image. I do what I want.'' Whither <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>? `` Old Gringo'' was conceived in 1980 when <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> met <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuentes </PERSON>, the celebrated Mexican author, and saw herself for the part of schoolteacher <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> spinster whose life is transformed during the Mexican revolution. <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> once said that <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON> was the only actress whose name alone could guarantee a film's financial backing. That's changed over the years, and <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> was an actress who helped when she and Oscar-winner <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> starred in `` <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>,'' a critical and commercial success. `` There's certainly more than one woman now, but it's definitely double-tiered, there's no question. Forty years ago, it would have been unthinkable,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` ` Old Gringo' went through a number of administrations and the first few just humored me. Sometimes that happens in studios. They want to keep a star happy.'' <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON> was supposed to play the role of iconoclastic author <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> <PERSON> Bierce </PERSON>, but could n't get medical insurance for the strenuous location work. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> stepped in. `` He and my father are the two male legends I have worked with,'' <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said. `` There's a kind of combination of smoothness of craft, depth of experience, combined with the willingness to really work hard, probe deep and not take it for granted. `` You could expect that at a certain point in someone's life, but not many would be ready to still do that _ turn themselves inside out. It's very painful; it's risky. My dad did it in ` Golden Pond.' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> did it here.'' And what's next for the ever-changing <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>? `` Stanley and Iris'' is due for release later this year. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> is also considering an American remake of the popular Spanish comedy, `` Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.'' And the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedys </ORGANIZATION> pop up once again. <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> has the rights to <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>'s Pulitzer Prize-winning book on <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, `` A Bright Shining Lie,'' a recipient of the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Book Award. All that money and eight years of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> have softened <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> just a little. She's no subversive, but do n't expect a book called `` Second Thoughts.'' Neo-liberals do n't appeal to her. Causes never run out. Retirement is doubtful: After more than nine lives in the public eye, she has no interest in landing gently on her feet. `` I am in the streets, in theaters, in restaurants, in grocery stores. I run in the park. I run in streets. I talk to people. I take buses. I wo n't have it any other way,'' she said `` Could I give it up some day for life on the farm? Yeah, absolutely. But I would n't retire, I'd probably organize the neighborhood.''

 Forbes magazine says its estimates of the net worth of what it considers the 400 wealthiest Americans are `` deliberately conservative.'' The magazine said its basic principle in compiling the estimates was to `` think in terms of how much a prudent buyer ... might be willing to pay for a person's net assets.'' Among the factors used in compiling the estimates, which <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> released Monday: _ Blocks of publicly traded stock were priced at the market close Sept. 8 _ Privately held companies were valued according to estimated revenues and earnings and to prevailing price-earnings ratios for publicly traded companies in similar businesses _ If earnings and cash flow were n't known, the magazine said, it adopted valuations typically used in particular industries _ For trusts and other inter-family arrangements, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said it worked on a case-by-case basis `` applying common sense. `` The fortunes of the very rich are, of course, very difficult to calculate,'' <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. `` Often it is n't even clear exactly who owns a great fortune.''

<TEXT>
 Americans paid an unusual amount of attention to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> in the past year, tuning in to news ranging from the rescue of stranded whales to the cleanup of the nation's largest oil spill <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> wants to hold their attention. The newswoman-entrepreneur owns <ORGANIZATION> Alaskan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newslink </ORGANIZATION>, a Juneau-based television news service that has provided reports from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to stations across the country since last spring. <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> came up with the idea almost by accident. Last April she met a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> news producer and reporter in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. They noted how much interest there was in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> news, how expensive it was to send a TV crew here and how there was no inexpensive alternative. `` You hear of businesses getting started on cocktail napkins. That's what happened,'' she said. Just days before, <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> had been on vacation out of state when the Exxon oil spill occurred. She recalled how a television news report made it sound as if <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s entire coastline was threatened by oil. `` I do n't think they had any perception of how large the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> was,'' she said. `` I realized there was a need in the market for immediate news access to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> from the perspective of an Alaskan reporter.'' Her first national story had nothing to do with oil. It was a feature on <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>'s Fourth of July celebration. What makes fireworks in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> so special? In July it does n't get dark enough to have a good fireworks show until about midnight, so the city holds its annual display in the early morning of July 4 `` I picked up the phone and called ` Good Morning America,''' she recalled. `` I told them I can offer you video of the first town in the country where fireworks have occurred.'' They bought it, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> viewers across the country had fireworks with their breakfast. Later that day, <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>'s fireworks were shown on the `` CBS Evening News.'' The Alaskan Newslink had hit the big time. Last month, when <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> completed its summer oil-spill cleanup, <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> was one of a small army of `` stringers,'' as free-lance reporters and photographers are known, covering the story in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. She found a free-lance TV cameraman and did reports for several big-city stations, including ones in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, paying a local public TV station to use their satellite uplink equipment. `` I produced, wrote and edited my own piece. I did my own reporting and a personalized standup,'' she said. `` I also got in the truck and drove up to the top of the hill and satellited it all off.'' In two days she earned about $ 2,000 profit. Not bad for a 31-year-old mother of three whose previous news experience was a stint as a weather reporter at <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>'s KJUD-TV. Her extensive business and marketing experience has helped _ she formerly was <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> sales manager for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ and she said she's learned a lot about news by seeking advice from professionals. One of those professionals is in her own family. Her uncle, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sias </PERSON>, is president of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, part of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to selling her own reports, <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> has a contract with Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>'s office to notify news directors in the Lower 48 when the state's news reports are available via satellite. <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>'s office has been providing free video reports on spill-related topics, and part of <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON>'s job is to report how they've been used <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> said she worked especially hard to make her spill reports balanced because of her business relationship with the state. `` News directors are very smart,'' she said. `` The first time you put together a public relations type of video, your business is over.'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, managing editor of <ORGANIZATION> KPIX-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kuhn </PERSON> has become `` a great resource'' to his station for video that otherwise would be unavailable. `` She's found a real need and she's filled it,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said it is in talks with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> about a possible cooperative operating agreement, setting the stage for a tug-of-war between <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> over the British automaker. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was considering buying a minority stake in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> as part of such an arrangement. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> announced three weeks ago that it wanted to buy up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, and left open the option of making a full bid for the British company. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the approach was friendly, but <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> called <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s interest unwelcome The money-losing luxury car company maintained that it wanted to remain independent, but it also said it might be interested in building ties with a major auto company. It was widely believed to be holding talks with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s brief statement said: `` <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> are in discussions concerning the possibility of the two companies entering into certain manufacturing, marketing and other commercial joint venture arrangements. As part of these arrangements, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> is considering taking a minority interest in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> declined to elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pekarek </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> confirmed his company has had discussions with <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> for several months regarding possible joint manufacturing, marketing and other ventures. `` In this connection, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is discussing the possibility of acquiring a minority interest in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> to assist <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> in remaining an independent British owned manufacturer,'' <PERSON> Pekarek </PERSON> said, refusing to elaborate. From <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said the announcement by <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> `` does not affect our view in any way'' about the advantages in a <ORGANIZATION> Ford-Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> association. `` We believe <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is uniquely qualified to assist <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> because of our long commitment to he <LOCATION> UK </LOCATION>, our British research, research and development capability, our sourcing to <LOCATION> UK </LOCATION> suppliers, and our continuing investment in our <LOCATION> UK </LOCATION> manufacturing facilities,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> statement said. The announcement came after <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> finished at 685 pence, or $ 10.82, a share, down 46 pence, or 73 cents, on active trading of 10 million shares. Dealers said the price fell on speculation that an alliance with <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> could discourage a hostile bid by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> or any other auto maker for <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. Trading has been very heavy since Friday, when <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, which previously owned 1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, received <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory clearance to buy up to 15 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> received early clearance from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve major share acquisitions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>'s rules of association prohibit any shareholder from taking more than a 15 percent stake before the end of 1990 and give the British government a `` golden'' share with which it may block any bid for the formerly state-owned company. These conditions were imposed when the British government privatized <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. Analysts have said <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> needs to link up with a major car company to provide the economies of scale necessary to remain competitive.

<HEAD>ALPA Vote Could Be Last Straw for Eastern Pilots</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Results of vote will not be released until Wednesday.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After eight months of a bitter walkout by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilots, a nationwide vote of pilots to be counted today could be the proverbial last straw for the striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> fliers. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> ballot on continuing strike payments to the Eastern pilots, if negative, would withdraw financial support from the beleaguered strikers and force them to pull down their picket lines after numerous setbacks in their fight against Eastern boss <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. At the same time, an upcoming <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote on Eastern could turn into a disappointment for the striking pilots, Machinists and flight attendants if their request for a blue-ribbon investigative commission is defeated. The 40,000 or so <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members were balloted last month on whether they wished to keep paying about 3 percent of their wages to their colleagues at Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which is trying to emerge from bankruptcy protection as a smaller carrier. Pilots at the other airlines have provided strike benefits to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots averaging about $ 2,400 a month per flier since the walkout began March 4. But the number of pilots paying those special assessments has decreased as the strike has worn on _ some have unilaterally decided to stop paying _ according to <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>, which represents pilots at nearly all the nation's major carriers. If the <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> vote is negative, `` It would be in everyone's best interest to go about their business and relocate to other airlines,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an airline analyst at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think the strike basically is over,'' he said Monday. `` Neither side has won; they've just sort of mortally wounded each other.'' The mail-in ballots, which had to be postmarked by midnight Sept. 25, are expected to be counted today and the results announced Wednesday. Eastern spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said the airline would have no comment on the matter until after the vote had been announced, and <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was unavailable Monday because of the Columbus Day holiday. The striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots, whose ranks have dwindled to around 2,400 from 3,600 when the walkout began, remained defiant. `` I feel confident,'' said <PERSON> Skip </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, head of the Eastern pilots union. Asked what might occur if the majority of <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> members vote to stop the payments, he replied, `` It ca n't happen; I ca n't even give that any consideration .... If <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> were able to beat us, there's no telling who's next.'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said the vote likely wo n't be 100 percent in favor of sustaining the benefits, but he insisted that the majority will opt to do so. If the pilots abandoned their <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> colleagues, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s bargaining position with all the carriers would be weakened, he warned The pilot leader cited strong support, especially from counterparts at mega-carriers <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Also this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> could vote on a bill, supported by the pilots, to set up a commission that would investigate the Eastern dispute. In a cloture vote last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided to cut off debate on the bill. But the White House and the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> have lobbied heavily against the bill, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is likely to veto it. In that case, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could n't muster the votes to override his veto, the pilots could suffer another crushing blow to morale. `` It would be terrible,'' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said. `` We're looking to the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a fair shake.'' In the latest setback for the pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> received permission last week from a federal bankruptcy judge to dip into $ 75 million held in escrow and to sell a $ 30 million note that it owns. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> also postponed until Dec. 15 a hearing on the unions' request for a special trustee to be appointed to run Eastern in place of current management, which is controlled by parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Consideration of the Eastern unions' request has been put off several times by the judge.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Lower, Gold Little Changed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was slightly lower against most major foreign currencies in early European trading today, and the British pound continued its slide. Gold prices remained little changed. Currency dealers in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the dollar had drifted lower in thin trading because of the absence of Japanese traders marking a national holiday. They predicted the dollar will move higher in the next few days, now that central bank intervention appears to have tapered off, except for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> which is trying to shore up the sagging pound. `` There's no intervention going on at the moment and it does n't look like there's anything else on the horizon that could bring the dollar down,'' said <PERSON> Jens-Uwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, senior trader at Manufacturers Hanover in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> `` And at the same time there's lots of commercial demand.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound fell to $ 1.5689 from $ 1.5775 late Monday. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8863 West German marks, down from 1.8865; 1.6480 Swiss francs, up from 1.6457; 6.3975 French francs, down from 6.4005; 2.1288 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1310; 1,384.00 Italian lire, unchanged; and 1.1745 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1749 Financial institutions were closed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> today for Sports Day, a national holiday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 143.30 yen. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 362.40 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 362.75. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 362.30. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 362.30, compared with $ 362.80 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 1.54 to close at a bid $ 363.08.

<HEAD>Other Unions Pledge Support as Boeing Machinist Strike Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM COUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The sixth day of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>' strike brought good news for pickets with some 25 other unions pledging support for the walkout against the aerospace giant. The union had asked for help in case the strike proves to be a long one, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, Local 751. The unions that voted support represent 125,000 workers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. No contract talks were scheduled as of Monday. There have been no talks since 57,800 Machinists walked out Oct. 4 after rejecting a three-year <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> contract offer. The strike affects <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> plants in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, at <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and several other sites. `` This was a real upbeat meeting,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said after Monday's one-hour session with other labor leaders `` People are willing to do whatever they can do monetarily. They're going to form a hardship fund, that type of thing.'' Other unions expressed solid support, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials, meanwhile, said they did n't know how to interpret the meeting and union support. `` I still do n't think anybody at this point knows how long a strike it will be,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Another <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>, said the company was waiting for more specific demands from the union before resuming negotiations. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> angrily dismissed <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s statement. `` ... The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> people who were involved in the negotiations know what our position is. They're just playing games,'' he said. Federal mediator <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> left a recording on his answering machine saying no talks were scheduled. In an <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> hotel north of here, recruiters from <ORGANIZATION> Intertec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, said they were deluged by hundreds of people answering their newspaper ad for aircraft maintenance workers. The visit was planned before the strike. `` When I got to town Sunday night, there were already 15 people waiting at the hotel,'' recruiter <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tubert </PERSON> said Monday. `` We hired 10 of the 15 people.'' <PERSON> Tubert </PERSON> said many <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> machinists were among those interested. He said some of the people <ORGANIZATION> Intermec </ORGANIZATION> has hired on this trip were strikers but he did not have exact figures. The two-year-old company is looking for licensed supervisors and mechanics and must hire 100 people before Jan. 1, he said. In <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered, hundreds of strikers rallied early Monday before joining pickets for a peaceful show of force at plant gates. There was a similar rally in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, where the 747s and 767s are built. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has delivered two planes since the strike began: a 747 to <ORGANIZATION> Malaysia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and a 757 to <ORGANIZATION> Ansett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian leasing company which will pass the plane on to <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Before the strike, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> committed to delivering 57 jetliners before the end of the year. Five consecutive years of record orders have given the company a backlog that stretches into the late 1990s. That backlog and the steady stream of overtime that workers have been asked to work were behind Machinists' demand for better wages and less overtime. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s offer featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, annual bonuses of 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990. Mandatory overtime would have been reduced from 200 hours per quarter to 160 hours and the cost-of-living formula improved to account for virtually all inflation. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said a Machinist in a middle skill grade, such as an engine mechanic, could see pay go from $ 34,389 this year to $ 43,138 in 1992, counting seniority and cost-of-living increases, but excluding $ 13,000 in bonuses and any overtime. Workers, who have seen bonuses but no increases in their base wage for six years, say that's not enough. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 356 million on sales of $ 9.07 billion for the first half of 1989, and had profits of $ 614 million on sales of $ 16.96 billion in 1988. The strike is the Machinists' first against <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> since 1977 when there was a 45-day walkout. Industry analysts say what happens at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> will affect labor talks at other aerospace plants. Talks have been extended in a Machinists contract that expired Sunday with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The union's contract with <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitor for jetliners, expires Oct. 22.

<HEAD>Airlines Haven't Picked Up Many Abandoned Braniff Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Only a few airlines serving <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> have stepped in to provide service lost when <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> cut its routes drastically almost two weeks ago. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> has added flights to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> has added two flights to <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. All three cities were eliminated from <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s schedule when the bankrupt carrier decided to operate with 20 departures out of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> airport. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had 93 flights in and out of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> daily before filing for bankruptcy protection. But airlines have not responded by adding flights to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and at least 15 other cities where <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had direct service. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, less than two weeks ago. About 2,800 of the company's 4,800 workers were laid off as part of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to reorganize as a small carrier. Additional cities that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> dropped as destinations from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> include <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>; Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> Many of those cities have direct flights from <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> by other airlines, but some of the other cities can only be reached by changing planes. For example, there now is no direct flight out of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudeikis </PERSON>, executive vice president of <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, travel agency <ORGANIZATION> Brennco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` People get used to having those direct flights,'' she said. `` It just gets to be a pain when they're not available any more.'' Given that most airlines have a limited number of aircraft already used in other routes, it appears unlikely that the other cities dropped by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> will be picked up soon by another carrier, Ms. <PERSON> Sudeikis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Mark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION>, said carriers that had direct flights to some of the cities eliminated by <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> had not experienced shortages. `` The other airlines have easily absorbed the demand,'' <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said, noting that this is an off-season for air travel. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> added that <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s cutbacks had not had an impact on air fares, either. `` It's probably too early for that,'' he said. Cities to which <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> retained its service but that have been the targets of expansion by other carriers are <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Both <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> have added flights to both of those destinations since <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy.

 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Thomson-CSF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, a major <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> defense equipment manufacturer, said Tuesday they might make a joint takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Ferranti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Signal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a troubled British defense electronics concern. In a brief announcement, British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF confirmed they were talking with <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> about a possible bid or other areas of cooperation. British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF did n't indicate what they might be willing to pay for <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON>. Analysts noted that a bid was n't likely to be made at much more than 70 pence, or $ 1.10 a share owing to the company's difficulties. <PERSON> Ferranti </PERSON> shares were down 1.5 pence at 58 pence in early afternoon trading on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Airline Plans Purchase of West German Airplanes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has purchased 33 twin-engine, turbo-prop airplanes from a West German manufacturer amid speculation that the carrier is a takeover target. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Midway, said the company has signed a letter of intent to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Dornier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> 328 airplanes for $ 244 million. She said the airline holds an option on an additional 40 planes, which seat 30 people each. Midway started a decade ago as a discount carrier serving the Midwest. Since then, the airline, the nation's 16th largest, has grown from three destination cities to 51. Analysts say the rapid growth of the company makes it an attractive takeover target. <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced in August it might seek control of the airline. The Pittsburgh-based engineering company has since increased its stake in Midway to 9.6 percent of the carrier's outstanding stock But Midway officials say they see no cause for alarm. `` We consider it a normal business investment and treat it accordingly,'' Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. She said Midway has not held talks with <ORGANIZATION> Ampco </ORGANIZATION> officials. Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said the airline will begin receiving the new aircraft in April, 1993. The planes will replace the Dornier 228, a 19-seat airplane Midway now uses on its feeder routes into <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, the airline's base of operations on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION>. During the transition to the new aircraft, Midway will lease 12 <ORGANIZATION> Embraer </ORGANIZATION> 120 aircraft from Dornier, Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The airline recently introduced first-class service and earlier this year ordered 74 new jets from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a deal worth about $ 2 billion. Midway also recently acquired <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> gates and routes out of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Belgium Raises Interest Rates For 4th Time in 2 Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The central bank Tuesday raised short-term interest rates for the fourth time in two weeks. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s three-month treasury bill rate, considered the key rate, was raised by a quarter of a point to 9.55 percent. The one and two-month rates were raised to 9.55 percent each from 9.2 and 9.25 percent respectively. The central bank did not comment on the rate increases. But foreign exchange dealers said they appeared aimed at supporting the Belgian franc, which was under pressure from the strengthening Deutsche mark following last week's interest rate increase in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank raised its key lending rates 1 percent, to help stem its booming economy. That brought the discount rate to 6 percent and the Lombard rate to 8 percent. The 1 percent rate hike was matched by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> announced smaller increases. Analysts said the increases were part of a coordinated effort by major industrialized nations to pressure the dollar, which lately has defied intervention by central banks from major industrialized nations.

<TEXT>
 Slick magazine ads will get more of the money <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spends to market its luxury Chrysler-brand cars in 1990 than will television spots. The strategy differs from previous years when 60 percent of the advertising budget went to broadcast and 40 percent to print media. This year's split will favor print media 70 percent to 30 percent for broadcast. `` We think luxury car prospects do n't view as much general-interest television as the population at large,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamdasek </PERSON>, national advertising manager for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> brand, said Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials, like those of other automakers, refuse to divulge specific amounts in advertising spending. <PERSON> Jamdasek </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will continue advertising its luxury models on television, notably around professional football, basketball and golf events and on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 60 Minutes.'' Magazines that will carry advertising for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars include <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, Fortune, <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> advertising, which is geared to a younger, less affluent market, will be heavily focused on broadcast, spokeswoman <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Laseki </PERSON> said. For Dodge and Jeep brands, advertising will be split on a 75-25 percent basis, with the majority going for broadcast ads. Advertising for Eagle brand cars will be split 65 percent for broadcast and 35 percent for print.

<HEAD>Court, in N.J. Case, Rejects Effort to Limit Tax Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today rejected, by a 6-3 vote, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration appeal aimed primarily at limiting tax deductions for some real estate investors. The court let stand a ruling that favored investors in the purchase of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> apartment complex. Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> voted to hear arguments in the case, but they fell one vote short of the four needed to grant such review. The case stems from the purchase in 1978 of the Summit House garden apartment complex in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, by <ORGANIZATION> Pleasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Prussin </PERSON> were among the partners in Pleasant & amp; Summit who bought the complex for $ 7.76 million. All or almost all of money came from loans to the Prussins. The couple claimed losses on the property, in depreciation and other deductions, of more than $ 762,000 for 1978 and 1979. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 disallowed the losses and said the Prussins owed the government about $ 400,000. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said the fair market value of the apartment complex was $ 4.2 million at the time of the purchase, not the $ 7.76 million claimed by the investors. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> officials said the transaction was intended to be a tax shelter, creating big deductions by inflating the purchase price. The 3rd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, in at least a partial victory for the Prussins, ruled last November 1988 the claimed deductions should not be disallowed completely. The Prussins should be allowed to claim a deduction based on the fair market value of the apartments, the appeals court said. It ordered a trial judge to determine the 1978 fair market value. The government appeal said the 3rd Circuit court ruling will `` produce grave inequities in tax administration and cause a substantial disruption in the efforts of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to achieve a prompt and fair disposition of a large number of tax shelter cases, especially cases involving real estate shelters.'' The appeal said that at least $ 630 million could be at stake in tax deficiency payments the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is seeking. The case is Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs. Prussin, 88-2133.

The examiners looked at 52 real estate loans that <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> had made since the 1984 exam. There were no credit reports on the borrowers in all 52 of the loan files. ...

 While skepticism remains over <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 7 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, one of the company's largest stockholders said today it has sold all its holdings in parent <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to cash in on the higher stock prices generated by the billionaire's offering. Windsor Fund manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said his mutual fund sold the last of its 425,000 shares Monday, getting $ 104 per share, or $ 44.2 million. The sale cleared out <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>'s holding in <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>, which at its height was 4 million shares during the quarter ended July, 31, 1988. Overall, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> was the second most actively traded stock on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Monday, inching up 87 -LCB- cents in composite trading to close at $ 104.62 -LCB- as 1.2 million shares changed hands. By late morning today, <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> had fallen $ 1.87 -LCB- to $ 102.87 -LCB- per share. <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said he had begun selling last Thursday, getting $ 107 a share hours after <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 120 offer was made public _ the stock's highest price before slipping back <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s cash offer for the airline's 58.9 million shares has been met with suspicion by many in the financial community who see it as a ploy to drive up the price and enhance <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s own holdings. American, the nation's largest and most profitable airline, has had little to say about the offer beyond its initial response that the bid would be considered `` in due course,'' although the company said it preferred to remain independent. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said he would put up $ 1 billion of equity in the deal, and believes financing is readily available for the remainder. However <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, who has managed the conservative Windsor Fund for 25 years, said, `` I have a hard time taking Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> seriously. $ 120's a very full price, and I do n't know where the financing is going to come from.'' `` This is n't loose change,'' he said. He also questioned <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 1 billion equity commitment. The developer's wealth is estimated in the latest issue of Forbes magazine at $ 1.7 billion, and <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said, `` I kind of wonder if he's really going to bet everything on AMR One, it's cyclical, two it's well run to start with, three the pilots and other prima donnas are very important on this and what if they do n't go along and finally, is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> going to sit on its hands and see the third biggy disappear.

 At a time when many corporations have loaded up on high-cost debt in the form of junk bonds, eight large concerns stand out from the field. Over the past decade, they have had almost no long-term debt. All are successful companies, too, and their success is recognized in the stock market by relatively high price-earnings ratios.

With her hard earned money the Genny girl can travel to her favorite resort in a floral printed linen suit, take a stroll in a breezy silk sun dress with halter top, sit by the pool in a raspberry pink tank suit and rainbow colored chiffon shirt jacket, and dance till the wee hours of the morning in a bright tangerine outfit with draped tie skirt and beaded bustier top. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON>, the eccentric pony-tailed German who designs the Fendi label, never travels with the pack.

Neither town nor country, the <LOCATION> Fendi </LOCATION> warm weather collection presented in an elegant downtown palazzo Monday night caters to the woman who has a wardrobe full of clothes but just ca n't resist <PERSON> Karl </PERSON>'s latest fling. Astrology is the name of <ORGANIZATION> Lagerfeld </ORGANIZATION>'s new game with signs of the zodiac appearing on the pockets of blazers, the prints of party dresses, and on the handbags and luggage of the Fendi's famed leather line. The <ORGANIZATION> Fendis </ORGANIZATION> call this new look `` personalized fashion,'' guaranteeing that the client's individual birth sign will appear on the item. <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON>, who designs his own prints, draws inspiration for his demure party dresses with short petticoated skirt from the drawings in children's picture books and the abstract black and whites of a De Chirico painting. For a quieter look <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON> presented a series of sand or black silk jersey outfits made up of a long tunic top worn over a matching long narrow skirt or tights. A lover of the unconventional, <LOCATION> Lagerfeld </LOCATION>, who also designs for <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> as well as having his own label, paraded his 40 models down a runway which wound its way through the seated guests, to the `` tune'' of a woman deep in the throes of love. The suggestive sounds shocked some of the Fendi aficionados, used to the warm family atmosphere that has become the trademark of the five Roman sisters. What no one banked on was that a power failure would turn off the lights and the music for several minutes. While <PERSON> Lagerfeld </PERSON> has happily reconciled his peripatetic designer's life _ he is based in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, teaches design in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, and designs for <ORGANIZATION> Fendi </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> _ the fashion crowd is eager to find out how Milanese <PERSON> Gianfranco </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> is faring since he accepted the post of designer for the famed Dior house in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. His spring-summer ready-to-wear collection, his first Italian production since his triumphant debut in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in July, was one of the most-awaited events of the Milan fashion week.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Hit 23-Month Low On Harvest Selling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices slumped to 23-month lows as a harvest-related sell-off continued this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Grain futures were narrowly mixed. The early decline in the soybean market followed a steep drop on Monday in a reaction to fine harvesting weather over the weekend. Dry conditions are expected to continue in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> this week, speeding the corn and soybean harvest along and keeping pressure on prices. Further selling was based on indications of better-than-expected corn and soybean yields and expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will increase its harvest estimates in a crop report due out Thursday afternoon. One survey of traders' expectations shows pre-report estimates averaging 1.91 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.39 billion bushels of corn compared with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s September estimates of 1.89 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.32 billion bushels of corn. In early trading, wheat futures were -LCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.06 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.34 a bushel; oats were unchanged to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.40 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4 \ cents lower with November at $ 5.53 -RCB- a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .25 cent to .62 cent higher with October at 72.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .40 cent higher with October at 83.15 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent lower to .50 cent higher with October at 47.10 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .40 cent higher with February at 46.97 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Monday.

 The stock market was lower at midday today, as many traders cashed in their profits from a robust recent advance. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 4.75 points at 2,786.66 at noon EDT. The blue-chip barometer has n't posted a daily loss so far this month. Declining issues edged out advances by about 7-to-6 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 728 issues down, 568 up and 505 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 70.97 million shares at noon, up sharply from 42.74 million traded by the same time on Monday, which had been its slowest pace in more than two months. Analysts said the market maintained its lackluster tone of Monday. Most of the attention was focused on stocks of companies involved in takeover bids. `` I guess it's sort of a profit-taking session,'' said <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's not exactly a bubbly session.''

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Aerospace operations in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> began shipping products to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> today after <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> officials determined the company had corrected serious procedural and quality control problems. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> personnel returned to inspecting equipment ready for delivery, lifting the government sanctions that held up more than $ 16 million in partial payments to <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON>, DCAS administrative contracting officer in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> had allowed only essential products to leave <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> since February, when the company was caught violating a number of defense department regulations. The Syracuse operation was allowed to continue limited manufacture of products. The company received the severe and rare sanctions because it was found to be mixing production on contracts for both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and foreign governments, whose specifications were less stringent, on the same production line. <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> said the company had corrected the problem of comingling by making the specifications and procedures required by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contracts the standard for all its production lines. The company also has guaranteed it will repair or replace any product in the field that is shown to be deficient. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Grasso </PERSON> said the company will now attempt to increase production to recoup time lost during the sanction period. In an effort to improve the <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> operation, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> announced a restructuring in September, creating separate divisions for its radar and sonar operatons. Now, <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s radar division is based in <LOCATION> Moorestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, while its sonar and related underseas systems are built in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>. The government-imposed sanctions affected all but 12 of GE-Syracuse's 1,100 defense contracts.

<HEAD>Chevron Files Suit for Permission to Send Tankers Through Channel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Chevron </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> and 17 other oil companies filed suit to overturn a <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> decision and allow oil shipments from offshore fields through the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION>. The suit, filed last Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, seeks to overturn an August ruling by the commission that blocked the shipments from the Point Arguello oil fields. The commission's ruling blocked a temporary county permit allowing tankers to operate between the Point Arguello project's marine terminal near <LOCATION> Gaviota </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s refinery in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segundo </LOCATION>. `` We believe the <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ignored numerous prior findings made by itself and the county in previous permit proceedings and approvals concerning our project,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, offshore district land supervisor for <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>, which is leading the legal fight. Commission officials could not be reached for comment on the suit Tuesday. A person at the commission's main office in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said no one with information on the action was immediately available to discuss it. The head of <ORGANIZATION> Get </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION>, a local citizens group opposed to offshore oil development, criticized the move, however. `` I think it's a bad move on their part and wo n't get them anywhere,'' said GOO President <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Feniger </PERSON>. The consortium has invested about $ 2 billion in the project. Oil officials believe the field contains about 300 million barrels of crude. Permission to ship the crude is one of the last remaining obstacles facing the project, which has yet to produce any oil. The League of Women Voters of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and GOO appealed the granting of the county permit to the commission, arguing <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> did not demonstrate that it could adequately handle a massive oil spill like the 10 million-gallon <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> spill in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> last March. The opposition groups also complained that a proposed pipeline project would not be in place before the tankers were to begin shipments and that the company had not explored other options for transporting the oil. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> had once agreed to build a pipeline but the proposal was scrubbed when elected officials and communities along the route filed legal challenges, said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON>. The county <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> said it approved a permit for the tankers last May because supervisors believed <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s Marine Emergency Management Plan adequately addressed the possibility of a disastrous spill. Point Arguello is about 40 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, which is about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> is the sea passage between the mainland and a string of pristine islands that provide homes to various wildlife.

<HEAD>President Says Company Had First-Qtr Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says the company posted another loss in the first quarter of its fiscal year, but he says the company will become profitable after some jobs and assets are cut. `` We have built up some layers of bureaucracy and processes that probably are not essential to the ongoing conduct of our basic business,'' company president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The computer manufacturer posted a loss of $ 374.7 million for the final quarter of the last fiscal year, leading to the resignation of <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, son of company founder <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, as president. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> became president Aug. 23. For the first quarter that ended Sept. 30, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> should show an operating loss in the range of $ 30 million to $ 70 million, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said, however, he expected the company to begin showing a profit by June 30, the end of its fiscal year. `` I would expect that we would have the operating earnings into the black,'' he said. But <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the profits would not be enough to offset earlier losses, making it necessary for <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> to cut more of its workforce. The company has reduced the number of employees by 20 percent to 25,000 since Jan. 1. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> declined to say how many more may lose their jobs. He said the company plans to sell about $ 800 million in assets not considered vital to its future, including real estate, credit subsidiaries and telephone switchboard units. He said he hopes to sell $ 400 million to $ 500 million of the assets within the next six months. The money will be used to reduce debt and interest payments. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said revenues for the first quarter of this fiscal year were about 13 percent lower than the $ 684 million for the first quarter of last year. The company had a restated profit of $ 13.1 million that quarter.

<HEAD>Study Says Most of Nearly 3,000 New Businesses Survive After Three
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An overwhelming majority of nearly 3,000 businesses that started up three years ago have survived, a survey released Tuesday said. The study by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> division and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> said that 77 percent of the 2,994 fledgling businesses in its survey are still in business after three years of operating. Sixty-five percent of those entrepreneurs said their level of personal satisfaction equaled or exceeded their original expectations, the study said. `` This study helps debunk the myth that most new businesses fail,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Barsa </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The study said the successful businesses had six common characteristics: self confidence; an initial investment of at least $ 50,000; emphasis on service rather than price; hard work; full-time devotion; and product knowledge. Success rates varied by industry, with the manufacturing sector having the highest survival rate, 82 percent, according to the study. That was closely followed by construction, 79 percent; service, 75 percent; and retailers, 73 percent, it said.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Hit 23-Month Low On Harvest Pressure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices sank to 23-month lows Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as a harvest-related sell-off stretched into the fourth straight day. Corn futures also retreated under harvest pressure while wheat and oat futures were narrowly mixed. The corn-and-soybean harvest is advancing rapidly under near-perfect fieldwork conditions and analysts said the higher-than-expected yields are hastening and extending the normal seasonal drop in prices. Many traders are betting that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will revise upward its harvest projections in a crop report slated for release after the close on Thursday. Last month, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimated 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean production at 1.89 billion bushels and corn production at 7.32 billion. But most analysts expect Thursday's numbers to be substantially higher. One news service survey shows analysts' soybean estimates ranging from 1.86 billion to 1.96 billion bushels and corn estimates ranging from 7.29 billion to 7.52 billion bushels. At the close, soybean futures were 4 \ cents to 7 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in November at $ 5.52 -LCB- a bushel, the lowest close for a near-month soybean contract since Nov. 11, Wheat futures were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 4.06 -RCB- a bushel; corn futures were -LCB- cent to 2 cents lower with December at $ 2.33 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.40 -LCB- a bushel

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it posted a 6.5 percent rise in its third-quarter profit due to strong demand for paper and specialty products and acquisitions.

 The <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it will introduce an electronic trading system next month to extend its trading hours in hopes of attracting more international business. With a Nov. 30 launch date, the LIFFE will beat the much larger <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures exchanges to the punch with an automated trading system. But the LIFFE system, at least initially, will extend the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> exchange's trading day to just 11 hours compared with the 24-hour capability of systems being developed by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Officials of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges said they would have to study the <ORGANIZATION> LIFFE </ORGANIZATION>'s system to weigh its potential impact on their own businesses. But at first blush, the <ORGANIZATION> LIFFE </ORGANIZATION>'s system looks like competition for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed trading network, dubbed <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> BOT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>. `` Competition is n't the worst thing _ it's often good for the overall market,'' <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON> said. `` The Board of Trade looks at this as something good for the industry.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LIFFE </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, announced the exchange's plans at a futures and options trade show in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. As planned, the system would operate from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> time for trading of Euromark and West German government bond futures. An early trading session, from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> time, would be added in the first half of 1990, as would all the exchange's other futures and options contracts. Some of those contracts, such as <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures and international currency futures, compete with products offered by the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges. Futures exchanges around the world are trying to extend their trading hours to capture more foreign business. The LIFFE system resembles the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> system, allowing traders sitting at computers to identify and trade with each other. The Board of Trade announced plans for <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> in March but has not set a launch date. The Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, is also working with the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on a possible joint venture in electronic trading. The Merc is working separately on <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, a blind trade-matching system slated for a launch early next year. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Sydney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the French futures exchange <ORGANIZATION> MATIF </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to offer some of their products for trading on <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>.

 The dollar ended sharply higher Tuesday after <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> hinted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates would remain firm in the near term regardless of the currency's movements. Gold prices slipped here and abroad. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 361 a troy ounce, down $ 2.10 from Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold also at $ 361 an ounce, off $ 1.50. Currency dealers attributed the dollar's rally mainly to remarks from <LOCATION> Greenspan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said `` attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates may lead to destabilizing international capital flows, and ultimately have to be abandoned.'' He said paying inordinate attention to intermediate targets in setting monetary policy `` may not promote the attainment of long-term goals.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been under pressure from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to take action to bring the dollar down from its steep rise against foreign currencies this year. It has also been urged by some officials to ease its grip on credit to steer the economy clear of recession. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said many dealers interpreted <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s remarks to mean that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> probably would n't push down interest rates any time soon, thereby keeping the dollar from declining. `` The market was poised to move up and that was a nice catalyst,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The British pound, meanwhile, continued its sharp drop Tuesday despite last week's hike in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s interest rates. One dealer said there is a lack of confidence in sterling. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it cost $ 1.5580 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.5775 late Monday. Sterling fetched $ 1.5520 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from $ 1.5775 Monday. <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> markets were closed Tuesday for a national holiday. But in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 143.25 yen, down 1.02 yen from Monday. The dollar stood at 144.50 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, up from 142.85 yen Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.9083 West German marks, up from 1.8875; 1.6670 Swiss francs, up from 1.6485; 6.4655 French francs, up from 6.3995; 1.17625 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17525; and 1,394.875 Italian lire, up from 1,383.25 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Monday: 1.8965 West German marks, up from 1.8865; 1.6545 Swiss francs, up from 1.6457; 6.4300 French francs, up from 6.4005; 2.1290 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1310; 1.1735 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1749; and 1,382.40 Italian lire, down from 1,384.00.

 Production at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> assembly plant will stop for about three months to retool the factory for the next generation of Escort subcompact cars, the company said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union said it anticipates fewer than 100 layoffs because of the changeover. The Wayne assembly plant west of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s principal source for the Escort, will stop production Nov. 22 and resume in late February or early March, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitcoff </PERSON> said. During that time, the plant will undergo an extensive retooling for the new Escort, which will be introduced to the public next spring as a 1991 model. The retooling is part of a $ 1.5 billion project <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> is undertaking for the new generation of Escort and Mercury Tracer cars. Along with the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> plant, Escorts and all Tracers will be made at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s Hermosillo, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, plant, which stopped production in late August. <PERSON> Pitcoff </PERSON> said the plant would not build 1990 Tracers since it had no facilities to install passive restraint systems required by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for 1990 model year cars. There are about 3,300 hourly workers at the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> plant. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, financial secretary of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union Local 900, said during the down time, workers will be retrained on the new production processes. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> currently makes Escorts at its <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, plant in addition to the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> factory. <PERSON> Pitcoff </PERSON> said he did n't know when Escort production would stop at the Edison plant to make way for changing the plant to producing Ranger small pickup trucks. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> needed the new source for <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> after deciding to build the Explorer sport-utility vehicle at its <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> assembly plant. In the 1989 model year, 366,354 Escorts were sold, making it the best-selling car in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the fourth-straight model year. `` This changeover -LRB- at <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> -RRB- jeopardizes our string of continuous model and calendar year sales titles for Escort,'' <PERSON> Pitcoff </PERSON> said. Escort was the best-selling car during the 1987 and 1988 calendar years. The Honda Accord was the second-best selling car in the country during the last model year with 362,437 being driven off dealer lots. The Ford Taurus was third at 360,237 sales.

 A major institutional investor in <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it has sold all its shares to take advantage of inflated stock prices in the wake of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 7 billion buyout proposal for the company that owns <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. Since last Thursday, when <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 120 per share offer was made public, <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> has sold its 425,000 shares, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, who has managed the fund for 25 years. `` We're out as of yesterday,'' <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said Tuesday. Meanwhile, little additional information emerged on <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s bid, revealed last Thursday in a letter to the company. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> he was serious about acquiring the airline, although he would not reveal any details of his financing. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> also said he would leave the airline's headquarters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>'s stock fell in trading in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, closing down $ 3.25 a share at $ 101.50, reflecting speculation that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s offer is a ploy to increase the value of his <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> stock and not a serious offer for the airline. `` I have a hard time taking Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> seriously. $ 120's a very full price, and I do n't know where the financing is going to come from,'' <PERSON> Neff </PERSON> said. `` This is n't loose change.'' At one time, the Windsor Fund held 4 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> stock, and airline said in its annual report institutional investors hold about 80 percent of its 58.9 million outstanding shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this week that some institutional investors were considering backing <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, despite <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>'s reputation as one of the industry's top executives <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had pitched his bid somewhat in the institutions' direction, promising to give them an immediate payoff in a company that has never paid a dividend since the holding company was created in 1982 `` This is the whole essence of the strategy,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a bank holding company in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is saying `` he wants to pay you off right now,'' while <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> has essentially said he would `` deliver more profits down the road than if I paid out 4 percent in a dividend.'' Most observers are awaiting some response from <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>, which has said nothing beyond its initial promise to review the offer `` in due course'' while adding it preferred to remain independent. The most-often mentioned alternatives include finding a friendly buyer, putting together a management-labor buyout deal, selling a large chunk of stock to employees or establishing a special dividend through a restructuring. <PERSON> Neff </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, office, said he had raised the issue of the dividend with <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON> many times. `` It's been a sticky issue,'' he said. AMR officials refused to discuss the policy, referring questions to the company's 1988 annual report, which includes almost a full page in defense of the no-dividend policy. `` The airline business is very capital intensive, and the funds that would be required for payment of a dividend are being used instead for capital expenditures,'' the report says. Noting that the company has averaged $ 1.03 billion in capital expenditures annually since 1983, and anticipates to spend $ 1.9 billion a year for the next five years, the report says, `` To pay a dividend in the midst of this capital spending seems counterproductive. Every dollar paid out as a dividend is one more dollar that would have to be financed, assuming a constant cash position.'' AMR denies the policy short changes stockholders, saying `` Reinvestment of earnings, with resultant share appreciation, is more beneficial to shareholders than receipt of dividends, especially on an after tax basis.'' Other profitable airlines, however, do pay dividends. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 1.20 last year and has paid a dividend during the last 40 fiscal years while growing to become the nation's third largest carrier behind <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe that it's part of our responsibility to stockholders to maximize their stake in the company,'' <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said. `` It's best for us to return a portion -LRB- of profits -RRB- through dividends.'' <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, paid dividends each quarter going private recently in a $ 3.65 billion buyout. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> also has paid dividends.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> announced Tuesday he was resigning as chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as part of a series of top-level personnel moves. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON>, 62, made the unexpected announcement to shareholders at the consumer products giant's annual meeting, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. He has been the company's chief executive for the last nine years and leaves office effective Jan. 2. Succeeding <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> as chairman and chief executive will be <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON>, who now is vice chairman of the board and president of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s international operations. Company president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> will give up most of his responsibilities for <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s domestic operations to oversee the international business. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> announced the changes at a shareholders' meeting punctuated by a demonstration by animal-rights activists. Several dozen picketed outside the company's headquarters while others questioned <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> during the meeting about <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s use of animals for product-safety testing. The company in recent years has been a target of animal rights activists, but maintains that marketing certain products without animal testing would be unsafe. Nine shareholders expressed concerns about animal testing Tuesday to <PERSON> Smale </PERSON>, who declined to say how many animals are being used in product testing. He said the company had reduced the number of animals it uses by one-third in the past five years and will continue seeking alternatives. Shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split that will become effective Oct. 20, increasing the authorized number of common shares from 500 million to 1 billion. After resigning his executive position, <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> will remain a <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> employee and will serve as a director and as chairman of the board's executive committee. `` By January, I will have been president and then chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Gamble for nearly 16 years,'' <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> said. `` I will have been the chief executive officer of the company for nine years. I've reached the conclusion that for me as well as for my family it's time to turn this responsibility over to someone else.'' <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> has led the company into new product lines and oversaw an $ 805 million reorganization two years ago aimed at streamlining management. During <PERSON> Smale </PERSON>'s tenure, the company acquired <LOCATION> Richardson-Vicks </LOCATION>, some major brands from <PERSON> G.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Noxell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Those moves gave the personal care-products giant a wide base in over-the-counter drugs and beauty products <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> had sales of $ 21.4 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30 and net earnings of $ 1.6 billion. <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> also helped the company branch out into foreign markets. Roughly 39 percent of its sales in the last fiscal year were based outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Smale </PERSON> said the figure should top 50 percent in a few years. <PERSON> Artzt </PERSON>, 59, has been vice chairman of the board and president of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> since 1984. His first major promotion was in 1969 when he was named vice president of the food products division. <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> also announced the selection of three vice presidents to the posts of executive vice president. Group vice president <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hintz </PERSON> will be responsible for the company's domestic paper products, cellulose and chemicals, and food and beverage businesses; <PERSON> Durk </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jager </PERSON>, also a group vice president, will be responsible for domestic soap, detergent and health and beauty care businesses; and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dirvin </PERSON>, senior vice president, will continue to oversee most of P & amp; G's staff functions, such as sales, advertising, marketing services and public affairs.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Plunge on Canadian Strike Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices staged a dramatic turnaround Tuesday, rising to new contract highs early in the session before plunging on reports that a 3-month-old strike at a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> copper mine was nearly settled. `` It was a very violent day,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, a metals analyst with the futures brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. On other commodity markets, soybeans sank to 23-month lows while grain futures were mixed; energy futures rose strongly; precious metals retreated; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Copper futures settled 2.6 cents to 3.6 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 1.2805 a pound, 5.65 cents off its intra-day high of $ 1.337. The market opened with strong gains, continuing the upward course that copper prices had taken since mid-year, when strikes and other production problems at major mines around the world began threatening supplies. But in the afternoon, reports surfaced of significant progress in a strike at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Copper </LOCATION>'s mine near <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, B.C., where workers walked off the job July 6 in a contract dispute. <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Killough </PERSON> confirmed there had been a breakthrough in negotiations over the weekend. `` We resolved all issues apart from pensions and wages and we are close on those,'' <PERSON> Killough </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We can see some light at the end of the tunnel.'' The mine's normal output is just under 1 million pounds per day, <PERSON> Killough </PERSON> said. Problems continue at large copper operations in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, but analysts said Tuesday's whipsaw price movement suggested further selling was likely. `` Regardless of the news, this should have follow-through to the downside,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. Soybean futures sank to 23-month lows on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as a harvest-related sell-off stretched into its fourth straight day. The corn-and-soybean harvest is advancing rapidly under near-perfect conditions and analysts said the higher-than-expected yields are exaggerating the normal seasonal drop in prices. In addition, many traders are betting that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will increase its harvest projections in a crop report slated for release after the close on Thursday. Soybean futures settled 4 -LCB- cents to 6 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in November at $ 5.52 -LCB- a bushel, the lowest settlement for a near-month soybean contract since Nov. 11, 1987. Wheat futures were 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with December at $ 4.07 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.33 \ a bushel; oats were unchanged to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.40 -LCB- a bushel Oil futures prices advanced on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid supply fears that prompted speculation <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> may cancel some of its crude oil shipments this month. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> canceled two planned cargoes of crude last month. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 15 cents higher with November at $ 20.17 a barrel; heating oil was .70 cent to .87 cent higher with November at 59.64 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .73 cent to 1 cent higher with November at 55.99 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures prices fell on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the dollar strengthened against other major currencies. Gold settled $ 2.10 to $ 2.30 lower with October at $ 361 a troy ounce; silver, falling for the fourth straight day, was 2 cents to 3.4 cents lower with December at $ 5.03 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle were .33 cent to .90 cent higher with October at 72.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .38 cent higher with October at 82.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent lower to .62 cent higher with October at 47.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .02 cent to .22 cent lower with February at 46.55 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 A powerful new personal computer using a new computer standard governing the accessories used in and with the machine was announced Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Dubbed the HP Vectra 486 PC, the floor-standing, 60-pound unit uses a new standard developed by a consortium of nine computer companies. Last year, the group broke away from the latest standard of <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in a challenge to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s control of design standards for PCs that is based on its own, called Micro Channel, which is used in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s PS-2 computers The Vectra 486 _ the first to use the new standard dubbed Extended Industry Standard Architecture _ `` marks the beginning of a new era in the PC industry and for <ORGANIZATION> HP </ORGANIZATION> as a supplier of high-performance PCs,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Puette </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION>'s personal computer group. The computer that will be available early next year comes in three standard models priced at $ 13,999, $ 16,999 and $ 19,999. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, editor of Microprocessor Report, predicted that competition would drive prices down later in 1990. The Vectra 486 comes with two megabytes of memory, a floppy disk and choice of hard disks with various capabilities. It also has eight slots designed for add-in boards built for EISA. `` In the past, users were forced to discard expensive DRAMs -LRB- dynamic random access microchips -RRB- when upgrading their PC's memory,'' said <PERSON> Puette </PERSON> `` With the new memory subsystem of the HP Vectra 486 PC, HP is the first supplier to protect users' initial investment in PC memory.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> is an international giant in computers and electronics. The Palo Alto-based company posted revenue of $ 9.8 billion in its 1988 fiscal year. It has 95,000 employees.

<HEAD>Investment Advisor Company Reveals 10.24 Percent Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based investment management concern increased its stake in British advertising conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to 10.24 percent, it was disclosed Tuesday. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it paid $ 79.7 million over the last two months to buy 3.4 million ordinary shares of <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>, the world's largest ad holding company. That increased Southeastern's holdings to 5.3 million American Depository Receipts -LRB- ADRs -RRB- _ or 16.1 million ordinary shares _ constituting 10.24 percent of the outstanding shares. Instead of buying shares in foreign companies through overseas securities markets, an American individual or company can buy shares in the form of ADRs, which represent a receipt for foreign shares held by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank. ADRs entitle the shareholder to all dividends. Southeastern, an investment advisor to individual and institutional clients including retirement plans and endowment funds, said it was buying the shares for `` investment purposes on behalf of client accounts.'' Southeastern said it was making the public filing because it `` has been contacted by one or more third parties'' about restructuring transactions `` other than a change of management or control'' of London-based <PERSON> Saatchi </PERSON>. In the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> said it had an investment philosophy of `` identifying undervalued situations'' and `` has no present intention to seek control of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Saatchi </LOCATION> -RRB- or otherwise to participate in the management.'' Southeastern also said that it `` will not initiate any acquisition or buyout proposal'' that involves securities in the portfolio of the registered investment company it advises, but is open to proposals from other entities.

<HEAD>USX Adopts Takeover Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors adopted a shareholder rights takeover defense on Tuesday, saying it wanted to deter coercive takeover tactics. Adoption of the plan, which was effective Tuesday, came less than a week after takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> disclosed that he was studying the feasibility of making a bid for the Pittsburgh-based steel and oil giant. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> controls 13.06 percent of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, including an additional 4.25 million shares acquired last week. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> fell 50 cents to $ 38.12 -LCB- a share Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Shareholder rights plans, commonly known as a `` poison pill,'' generally are aimed at thwarting hostile takeovers by making them prohibitively expensive. The <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> plan would take effect once a person or group acquired at least 15 percent of the company's common stock. Under the plan, shareholders would be issued one stock right for each common share they already hold. The <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> board could give shareholders the option of exchanging the rights for common stock, at the ratio of one share of common stock for each right, thus increasing the number of shares a raider would have to acquire. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> said the plan was designed to prevent someone from gaining control of the company without offering a fair price to all stockholders. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who owns <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said his group was considering making proposals for `` business combinations'' with <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>. He made the comment in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> last Thursday.

 A Taiwanese businessman made more than $ 16.5 million by trading on inside information he bought from a junior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a federal securities fraud indictment unsealed Tuesday charges. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a fugitive believed to be in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, was charged with 493 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud and fraud in connection with a tender offer. The indictment was filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> almost a year ago but remained under seal as investigators continued their search for <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said. The $ 16.5 million in illegal profits described in the indictment makes the case the second largest insider-trading case behind the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal in 1986. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-jailed stock speculator, agreed to return $ 50 million in alleged illicit profits and pay $ 50 million in penalties to the government. Authorities decided to unseal the charges against <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in hopes publicity surrounding the case would help apprehend him, <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said. He added that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not have an extradition treaty with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> covering the offenses in the indictment. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> faces up to five years in prison on each of the 493 criminal charges and tens of millions of dollars in fines, <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> said. The prosecutor also said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, through his attorneys, agreed to pay $ 25 million to settle a civil complaint brought by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in June. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 39, was accused of paying the <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> analyst, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, $ 200,000 for non-public information about upcoming mergers, takeovers and leveraged buyouts involving companies represented by the investment firm. The indictment identified 16 deals between June 1987 and July 1988, long after the Wall Street insider trading scandal made headlines, in which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> earned more than $ 16.5 million. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> allegedly carried out the illegal transactions by trading in more than 40 accounts at eight foreign and domestic brokers, the indictment said. Some accounts were in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s name but most were listed in the names of relatives and other third parties. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> entered into a cooperation agreement with prosecutors in September 1988 and pleaded guilty to three counts of fraud in connection with his scheme with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, 25, who no longer works for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION>, originally was sentenced to three years in prison but his term was reduced to eight months and he was recently released. He joined <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> in June 1988, working in leveraged buyouts before transferring to mergers and acquisitions.

 Stock prices lost ground Tuesday as many investors decided to cash in on the market's recent gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, falling for the first time this month, declined 6.08 points to 2,785.33. Led by blue-chip issues, <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> had advanced to record highs recently. Many market strategists have expected the Dow average to show some resistance as it approaches the 2,800 mark, which it has never surpassed. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of stocks listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 831 down, 652 up and 493 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 147.56 million shares, up from 130.72 million in Monday's session, which had been the lowest level in more than two months. Analysts said Tuesday's retreat was due mainly to profit-taking. Although volume picked up sharply from Monday's sluggish pace, the market remained featureless, they said. `` Dull, dull, dull,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisler </PERSON>, an executive vice president of equity trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's no overriding theme right now.'' Traders are watching interest rates, especially in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and looking toward corporate earnings reports for the third quarter due out soon. `` You could see some surprises, both on the downside and the upside,'' <PERSON> Meisler </PERSON> said, referring to the company reports. Among actively traded issues on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent AMR tumbled 3 -RRB- to 101 -RRB-, apparently reflecting investor skepticism about a $ 120-a-share offer made last week by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T was down -RCB- at 43, <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 | to 102 \ and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> lost 1 at <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> jumped 1 -LCB- to 52 ~ amid renewed takeover rumors, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> was up -RCB- at 63 -RCB- and <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> gained -LRB- at 45 -RCB- Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 176.78 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 6.29 billion, or 0.18 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.34 to 199.00. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index slipped 0.76 to 409.73, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.67 at 359.13.

 <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, suffering from a sales slump, unveiled a system of office software Tuesday designed to allow computers made by different companies to share information and work together. The action marks the latest move toward equipment that is compatible across the computer industry, easing some of the confusion for customers who have had to struggle with diverse systems, analysts say. `` With any large company, the most important and hardest business problem is that they have all these different types of desktop computers, and they want all these people to work together,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ancona </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for business and office information systems. The new system will be compatible not only with <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s VAX computers but with popular systems from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, as well as software from <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. Workers using this system `` can share computing software, and transmit data, documents and pictures,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>, president of the Maynard-based company, said in a statement. `` It's just common sense.'' The software, which was presented Tuesday at an office computer convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, will be available next year. Digital, the world's second-largest computer company behind <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, was long known for the compatibility within its VAX system. Digital promoted this with the slogan `` Digital has it now,'' a jab at its giant rival, whose systems until this year lacked that capability. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> now has software that can run across the full range of its machines. But company officials and analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s move takes compatibility further by linking computers from different companies. `` We believe that reflects the reality of the market,'' <PERSON> Ancona </PERSON> said. `` It would be arrogant to tell a customer that if you buy our computer, you have to throw out everything else you've invested in.'' `` I think DEC's made a very significant step forward,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a computer research firm based in <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>. `` Digital is saying if you do n't have a Digital PC -LRB- personal computer -RRB-, it's fine,'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. `` Their concern is the underlying system.'' Computer software, which runs the machines, is becoming a more lucrative market than the computers themselves, which are becoming less expensive, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said. Also, Digital can employ the integrated system to introduce its products to customers using other brands of computers, and possibly persuade them to use more <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> equipment, said <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Monosson </PERSON>, publisher of The Monosson Report in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, which monitors activities at Digital. The introduction of the new system comes as the company tries to reverse a sales slump. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings slid 22 percent for the year that ended July 1, and the company has frozen salaries and transferred hundreds of employees from manufacturing to sales jobs. Last week, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, who was in charge of sales and was long regarded as the No. 2 man at <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>, resigned. Analysts noted that he had fallen out of favor amid the company's slowdown. Part of the company's slump could be blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s rapid introduction of new products, which confused sales people and customers, analysts said. But that will not be the case with the new system, <PERSON> Ancona </PERSON> said, since the programs will build on the VAX system, not depart from it. `` There has been confusion ... it would be complicated about what they had and did n't have,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Cambridge-based management and technology consulting firm. `` But now they're able to give a more simple message about what they're doing,'' he said.

<HEAD>Levi Strauss Decides Against Sponsoring Channel One Launch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Levi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strauss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of eight advertisers who bought commercial time during last spring's test of the Channel One news show for teens in the classroom, has decided against being a sponsor when the service goes national in the spring. The San Francisco-based apparel maker said Tuesday it felt that sticking with media vehicles like network and cable television would offer a more efficient and less expensive way to reach the audience of young men aged 14 to 24 that it targets with ads for its Levis 501 jeans. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chew </PERSON>, marketing manager for <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, said the controversy that Channel One stirred among some national education groups and others about permitting paid pitches in the classroom played no role in <PERSON> Levi </PERSON>'s decision. `` We never reached the point internally where we discussed the issue of in-school advertising,'' he said. `` I'm not sure how that would have come out.'' Chew declined to say how much <PERSON> Levi </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> was being asked to pay for commercial time on Channel One, but said the company felt it could reach a wider audience at less cost by sticking with traditional media. <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, the producer of Channel One, is currently lining up advertising support and signing up schools for its daily 12-minute news shows that will include two minutes of paid advertising. It hopes to make Channel One available in 8,000 schools reaching 6 million teens by the end of 1990. Whittle spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based media company wo n't discuss in advance which advertisers have signed up for the national rollout of the service, scheduled for March 1990. Whittle Chairman <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> announced last month that after 90 days of advertiser recruitment, Channel One was already more than halfway toward its goal of selling $ 90 million in commercial time the first year. He said some of the companies who were in the test program in six schools last spring would be included in next spring's rollout while others would not. Among other advertised products in last spring's test were candy from M & amp; <ORGANIZATION> M-Mars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; chewing gum from Wm. Wrigley Jr.. Co.; shampoo, deodorant, acne medication and potato chips from <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and mints and cough tablets from <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>K mart Chairman Says New Stores, Ad Appearances Will Help 4th Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opening 43 new K mart discount stores in the fourth quarter could boost the end of a lackluster year at the nation's second-largest retailer, Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> also said at a news conference that he will make some personal appearances in television ads in an effort to lure customers. `` I can go on TV in front of the American public and tell them what we are doing,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> outlined a $ 1.3 billion expansion plan that would increase the number of K marts to 2,500 by 1995 from the current 2,283. Lower-than-expected inflation and interest rates and better-than-expected employment raise the possibility of the kind of strong holiday sales that could rescue an otherwise slow year, <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said. Because the economy seems to be holding up, he said, `` We're more optimistic than we were four months ago. K mart will open 43 new stores this fall and complete expansions of 63 others by the end of October, <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said. He said he already made television commercials being tested in the Pueblo and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> areas of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, and will appear in national television ads during two Christmas specials K mart is producing. One is `` Christmas in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' a movie that will star <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>. The other a special on Christmas entertaining with author <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who also lends her name to a line of K mart household products. K mart bought national television advertising during about 24 weeks this year and will increase that to about 30 weeks next year, keying some ads to products featured in its newspaper circulars, <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said. He said last week that cutting prices to gain customers has reduced profit margins and is expected to lower third-quarter earnings below last year's. The company reported earnings of $ 145 million in its second fiscal quarter, which ended July 26. That was down 10.9 percent from a year earlier, though second-quarter sales of $ 7 billion were up 4.8 percent. September sales of $ 2.6 billion were up 6.1 percent from September 1988, but up only 3 percent when comparing stores open for the full year. From the start of the fiscal year Feb. 1 through Sept. 27, sales reached $ 17.7 billion, up only 4.7 percent overall and a sluggish 1.2 percent on a comparable-store basis. K mart reported fiscal 1988 earnings of $ 803 million on sales of $ 27.3 billion. Profit margins will improve as the company connects 2,200 of its stores to a centralized inventory computer system by the end of next year for greater marketing precision, <PERSON> Antonini </PERSON> said. `` We know what product sells in <LOCATION> Hoboken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, we know the price it sells for, and we know how many sold on Monday,'' he said. `` We never knew that before.''

 Recent commercial agreements will allow <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to double steel exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and increase other types of non-petroleum exports, <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON> said Tuesday. The agreements, reached during President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week, will help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s developing economy and further reduce its reliance on petroleum exports, <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON> said `` The most important thing we've done is set up a program to promote trade, rather than just resolve problems as they come up,'' <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON> said. `` Before it was a passive agreement,'' he said. `` Now we have an active agreement, with dates and deadlines for considering improvements in trade.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Commerce <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> will be visiting <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> next month for further talks on expanding trade. One 30-month agreement more than doubled <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s quota for steel exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, from about 370,000 tons annually to about 800,000 tons, he said. The exact tonnages depend on the mix of steel products involved. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also agreed to consider lifting tariffs on 43 categories of products, including data processing equipment, beer, car parts, plastics, glass and crystal products, toilet paper and other paper products, jalapeno chilis and alphabet blocks for children. He said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> felt it deserved concessions because it had gone so far to free its own market of government control and protectionist rules. `` Right now we have one of the most open economies in the world. That allows us to ask for reciprocity,'' <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON> said. Intellectual property rights remain a sticking point. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry has long complained that Mexicans steal patented ideas, especially in the pharmaceutical field, and some firms refuse to invest in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for fear their patents will not be respected. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wants to resolve the problem in order to modernize its industry, but that nothing would be done to put the Mexican pharmaceutical industry out of business overnight. He said forthcoming negotiations will lead to a higher textile quota for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, adding that the Mexican textile industry's main problem in the past had not been quotas but competitiveness. He said that with the opening of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economy to foreign competion since <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mexican industry has become much more competitive in both quality and price. Under previous protectionist policies that virtually prevented imports of everything from chocolate bars to refrigerators, Mexican manufacturers got away with making shoddy goods at high prices for the domestic market. With regard to steel, <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON> noted that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> exported $ 286 million worth to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the first nine months of 1989, up from $ 232 million in 1988. Steel is <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s eighth-largest export, he said Also reached, said <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON>, was an agreement to push closer commercial relations along the U.S.-Mexico border, including examination of new customs protocols and agreements to allow trucks to circulate freely on both sides of the border. <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> <PERSON> Puche </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s overall non-petroleum exports have risen from $ 4 billion in 1983 to $ 15 billion in 1988, with a further 10 percent increase expected this year. Petroleum has dropped from 90 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s export trade to 30 percent, although that is also partly due to the drop in world oil prices since 1982. He said efforts were being made to push exports to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the Far East, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remains the world's largest consumer market and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s closeness to that market is an advantage.
