 The man accused in the drug-related torture slayings of 12 people at his ranch near <LOCATION> Agua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, will accept deportation to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, his attorney said Thursday. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> <PERSON> Burqueno </PERSON>, accused of murder and other charges in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, agreed to the deportation Thursday provided his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship application remains valid, attorney <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donau </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said following a hearing before Immigration Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarrick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donau </PERSON> said the effect of Thursday's deal `` was to preserve -LRB- <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON>'s -RRB- right to pursue his citizenship application and at the same time set a date when he would be voluntarily returning to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> lawyer said <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> would n't return to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> at least until Oct. 1 because he needs additional time to complete the application process. However, <PERSON> Donau </PERSON> also said he does n't expect the application to be succesful until the charges in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are resolved. <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> is entitled to citizenship, <PERSON> Donau </PERSON> said, because he is a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> veteran. <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> had sought political asylum but that request was withdrawn after <PERSON> McCarrick </PERSON> refused to bar reporters from the courtroom. <PERSON> Donau </PERSON> said his witnesses consequently `` refused to testify if their testimony would be made known to the public at large.'' <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON>, who remained in custody, is working to acquire Mexican legal counsel before facing <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s charges of first-degree murder, concealment of accomplices, criminal association and violation of burial laws, <PERSON> Donau </PERSON> said. Mexican officials have said statements by <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON>, 29, who is believed to be involved in the slayings, placed <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> at the ranch where the bodies of the torture victims were found, four in a septic tank pit and eight others stuffed into a well. <LOCATION> Aqua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> is just across the border from <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>. Authorities believe they were killed on March 24 and 25. <PERSON> Fragoso </PERSON> was arrested April 20 in a mobile home near Three Points, a tiny community about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tapia </PERSON> was turned over to <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> authorities Aug. 10 after he was detained and questioned by authorities in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>.

 They made their beds, again and again. But there was no time to lie in them during a contest for 50 housekeepers from the city's top hotels that was _ dare we say? _ sheer bedlam. `` People have been killed by flying percale,'' cautioned comedian <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON>, the master of ceremonies, before the `` Fastest Hands in the East'' contest for the coveted Brass Bed award got under way on Thursday. Twenty-five beds were lined up in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> ballroom. The sheets, blankets and pillows were piled on tables three feet away. Unconfirmed reports surfaced about training that involved aerobics, high-carbohydrate diets and good-luck charms. Energy levels were raised a notch by an announcement that spending money _ $ 500, $ 300 and $ 200, respectively _ had been added to the top three prizes: a trip to the <LOCATION> Fontainebleau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION> hotel in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, a weekend at the Arrowwood resort in <LOCATION> Rye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and a pair of his-and-hers watches. It was clear that <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahenkora </PERSON> of the Drake Hotel was a force to be reckoned with. She bounced in her chair, smiled confidently and cheered at just about everything. The housekeepers _ all women _ lined up at the head of their beds, hands poised above the linens. Judges with stopwatches stood at the foot of the beds; silence blanketed the room. Nervous contestants had a couple of false starts before <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> blew the starting whistle. Then the sound of snapping sheets filled the ballroom as the contestants sprinted around the beds, deftly smoothing and stuffing. Ahenkora doubled her pillow with a karate chop, swiftly dispatching it into its case. The crowd _ filled with rooting sections of friends and coworkers _ went wild. `` Tuck! Tuck!'' screamed one spectator, reminding a panting contestant to make the required hospital corners. `` Come on, <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON>!'' `` Oh, that's messy!'' The contestants were divided into two groups for the preliminaries. Ten semifinalists went onto the three final heats. To signal the judge that they were finished, they perched or crumpled on the end of their beds. After everyone took a breather, <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> announced the winners and handed out the trophies _ miniature replicas of brass beds. <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Maye </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> <PERSON> Windsor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotel </PERSON> took the top prize, clocking her last three beds in a total time of 3 minutes, 37 seconds. Her friends joyfully tackled her to mark her Super Bowl of Beds victory. In a post-contest interview she revealed her winning strategy: `` Before I came here I made 10 beds in less than an hour.'' <PERSON> Dora </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> of the Empire Hotel was a close second, with a time of 3 minutes, 40 seconds. She also made the neatest-looking bed. `` I'm tired now,'' she told well-wishers. <PERSON> Ahenkora </PERSON> was clearly disappointed with her third-place finish at 3 minutes, 45 seconds. `` I did n't practice,'' she lamented. `` The bed is too soft; you make one side and it pops out on the other side.'' She can try again next year, though; sponsors promised to make it an annual event.

 Islanders say there is a curse on this mysterious 700 year-old ruined city they know as the Reef of Heaven. The curse is so strong, they say, that no one will stay overnight. `` No way. The last person who stayed there was a <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> governor about 100 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Bermin </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON>, director of tourism and natural resources for <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION>, site of the city and one of the three island states that make up the Federated States of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>. `` He was found mysteriously dead the next morning. You would n't catch me there, no way.'' But <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON> is more than happy for tourists to come in daytime to see a stone megalith that is one of the wonders of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. It is the prime tourist attraction of this impoverished, remote island 2,485 miles west of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Few people know about <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdol </PERSON>. No one has fully explained how it was built or who built it. Most Pacific islands never had a Stone age, but at <LOCATION> Nan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mahdol </LOCATION> the walls are made of stone blocks that weight up to 50 tons. Archaeologists believe the stones came from another island and brought to the site on rafts. But how laborers were able to lift them remains a mystery. It takes an hour by fast boat across a lagoon to reach the city. At low tide visitors must wade through a sea grass swamp and climb slippery rocks to the dark gray, moss-covered walls of the ruin. <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdol </PERSON> is a canal city built on 92 artificial islands 15 miles from <LOCATION> Kolonia </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION>. Built near the passage through the coral reef into the lagoon, it covers 160 acres. Huge walls of basalt rock up to 20 feet high enclose a deserted city with burial chambers, vaults made of giant stone slabs and pathways of crushed coral. Scientists believe an advanced civilization built a seawall, a priestly burial place, and adminstrative center, servants quarters, a ceremonial center, a coconut-oil processing area and a communications center where messages were sent by beating log drums. Carbon dating of the ruins indicates the city was built between the years 1285 and 1485. Recent underwater archaeology suggests it might be even older. Legend also says <PERSON> Nan </PERSON> <PERSON> Madol </PERSON> was created by magicians who then flew off into space. Nowadays, people of <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION> are divided over who owns the city. The local paramount chief, <PERSON> Salvadore </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadley </PERSON>, claims it is his. The government also claims it. At stake is who gets the revenues from tourism. `` I do n't ever want to see the day that a paramount chief and the government are fighting one another in court,'' said <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON> the tourism official. `` It goes against all our traditions. But it is our greatest tourist asset.'' Last year almost 8,000 tourists visited <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION>, a lush volcanic island which in turn was ruled by <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It is now the capital of <LOCATION> Micronesia </LOCATION>, made up of the islands of <LOCATION> Pohnpei </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Truk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kosrae </LOCATION>, all formerly part of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-administered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territory </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON> wants to build a road to the shoreline near <LOCATION> Nan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mahdol </LOCATION> to make the trip easier for tourists. He'd like to add a restaurant and souvenir shop. But no hotel. `` No one will stay overnight,'' <PERSON> Wellbacher </PERSON> said.

 A young man and woman who may be the legendary `` lost white children'' of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> say they have a sister, and they introduced her during a visit to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy. All three arrived at the embassy last week for an interview with consul <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in an effort to find their parents. They say they were taken from a white family about 20 years ago by the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> housekeeper, whose sister and brother-in-law raised them as members of the Oromo tribe. The story of two lost white children is told in many variations, usually involving a kidnapping. A representative of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has come to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> in hopes of taking all three to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are prepared to arrange transportation, care and education for them in the States,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Laytner </PERSON>, an author and free-lance journalist from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Laytner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> say that may be difficult because <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadessa </PERSON> and his sisters <PERSON> Tegest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lesa </PERSON> are, at least for now, considered to be Ethiopian nationals `` Anything we do will be legal,'' said <PERSON> Laytner </PERSON>, who carried a letter from former <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Angier </PERSON> <PERSON> Biddle </PERSON> <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a committee director, identifying him as its representative. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is a non-partisan agency to assist, resettle, rehabilitate refugees. It is supported by foundations, corporations, unions, community groups and individual contributors. <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tegest </PERSON> came to the attention of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials when an <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> friend took them to the embassy in June. In their interview with consul <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who retired earlier this month, they did not mention their sister, <PERSON> Lesa </PERSON> _ fearing for her safety, they say now. Meeting with the new consul last week, the three told essentially the same story <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tegest </PERSON> related to Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> through an interpreter two months ago. It was <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' first meeting with the young people, thought to be in their early 20s. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter was allowed to attend the two-hour interview. They say they have no clear recollection of their real parents, but spoke for the first time of seeing a photo album in the grass-thatched mud hut that became their home. Pictures in the album showed them as small children with their white parents, they said. <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> said fire destroyed the hut and photos years ago. They say they do n't know for sure why they were taken to live with the tribal couple. They believe their father became ill and had to be evacauated, and that their mother went with him. Mrs. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and others think the story of the lost white children may have been kept alive by occasional sightings of <LOCATION> Haile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mariam </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lesa </PERSON>. They were kept by the Oromo couple and <PERSON> Tegest </PERSON> was sent to another family as a maid. The embassy has found no record of the youngsters or their parents, but <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said a few vague clues arose after their story came to light. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> and an Ethiopian lawyer hired by the embassy are trying to run down the clues. He said one was a tip in a letter mailed from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> that the father had been a brewery chemist in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. As a result of the article, people sent cash, checks and offers of help to the embassy. `` Initially we discouraged people from sending money because, unless these people are <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, we would have no authority to set up a trust account for them,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. Later, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suggested establishing an account through someone not connected with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. `` We would like to try to set up an account through a benign person here, a missionary or somebody,'' he said. `` There is significant interest in this, serious interest,'' at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The Oromo woman who raised the three recalls her brother bringing them to her and denied they were kidnapped, but was vague about brother's motives. She said he died soon afterward. `` They were beautiful children, very white,'' she told reporters through an interpreter at her farm 50 miles from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. She is in her 70s and divorced. Although they carry her last name, the youngsters bear no resemblance to the black woman who raised them. Their hair is light brown to blond, their complexions a ruddy bronze. They tell of a lifetime of physical abuse by their foster father and other villagers because of their strange appearance. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> ended the interview when they became agitated. The interpreter said they were tired of retelling their story to consular officers and reporters without result, and frightened by the increased hostility of fellow villagers caused by their notoriety. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> overseas service broadcast their story in <LOCATION> Amharic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s official language, and many Ethiopians heard it. Because of what the interpreter said, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> took up an office collection to rent a small apartment in the capital for a month. He had the young people resettled and urged them to return to the embassy for more conversations. `` If only we can jog their memories enough, we may be able to find further clues to their identities and their parents,'' he said. Just before the meeting with <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> ended, <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> said: `` Our thought is that if our parents are dead, why have n't our grandparents, aunts or uncles come looking for us? This is what we always think. This is what we do n't understand.''

 Democracy Central here is an ornate four-story building where the fledgling grass-roots political movement <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> uses high - and low-tech to get its message across in the drive for <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s independence On the third floor, college students duplicate political statements the old fashioned way _ by typing with carbon paper. The copying machine is broken. One floor up, the <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> uses a new fascimile machine to receive a letter from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> signed by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> supporting freedom for the Baltic republics. The offices of <LOCATION> Sajudis </LOCATION>, just over a year old, have all the trappings of an upstart citizens group struggling with meager resources to change the world. There are n't enough phones, chairs or desks, and the staircase is crumbling, but there is no shortage of dedication. Dozens of helpers stream through the offices. Hundreds of people stop daily at the newsstand on the ground floor to pick up a copy of the Sajudis newspaper. The very existence of the office is an important political accomplishment in a country where the government tightly controls allotment of buildings, phones and copying machines. The windows look out on <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>' Cathedral Square, where protest posters demanding `` Occupiers Go Home'' _ a reference to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers who have been stationed in the republic since 1940 _ and `` Freedom for <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'' are displayed around a bell tower.

 Although the drive for independence is gradually gaining official, ambiguously worded support from the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, sometimes activists have to settle for symbolism. Dozens of streets have been de-Sovietized, or given back the names they had before the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> tanks rolled in in 1940 and made <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> a part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The street where Sajudis headquarters is located, <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> <PERSON> Prospect </PERSON>, was recently renamed for <PERSON> Gediminas </PERSON>, the Grand Duke of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, who made <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> the capital in 1322. A poster on the wall of Sajudis headquarters spells out the word perestroika, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform drive, in fading letters. A calendar depicts the currency used when <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> was independent from 1918-1940. Independence activists hope the republic will soon be able to have its own currency again. Graffiti artists are getting into the act. `` Red Army Go Home'' was painted in red in English on a sidewalk near a hotel frequented by foreigners.

 They are portrayed as bride and groom or as soldiers with blood dripping from their mouths, and are constant targets of both verbal and physical abuse. Mere mention of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> once struck hatred, loathing or fear into the hearts of millions, but in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, the two dictators are now openly ridiculed. Attacking <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> is certainly not new in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> is now officially vilified for `` repressing'' millions of people and setting up the tight, centrally commanded economy that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is trying to streamline. But the open accusation that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was in cahoots with <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> is relatively new. `` For the first time we pondered and publicly announced that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> were branches of the same tree, and their policy was equally disastrous for our small <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Vilnius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Vecherniye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Evening News -RRB- said Wednesday. The most dramatic attack on the men who engineered the carving up of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> in a secret 1939 agreement was their burning in effigy Wednesday. Members of the Lithuanian <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> _ a radical group that demands <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> secede from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ carried a <LOCATION> Hitler-Stalin </LOCATION>, two-headed soldier through downtown <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> on the anniversary of the secret deal. The effigy was carried to an independence rally in a park, where a speaker said the two dictators `` drank from one glass the blood of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>.'' To wind up the demonstration, the effigy was burned. Orange flames quickly engulfed it, sending black smoke and ashes aloft. The dictators' heads and their blood-smeared mouths were the last to go up in smoke.

 The Who blasted off nearly a decade of rust with a thundering performance of their rock opera `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>'' on Thursday night, bringing a graying crowd of baby boomer fans to their feet. Led by a 44-year-old <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON>, the Who put on a stirring rendition of their old act, minus the guitar-smashing antics of 20 years ago. `` Everyone here is obviously full of love and good feelings,'' said former LSD advocate <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leary </PERSON>, who once coined the phrase `` Turn on, tune in, drop out.'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> joked about his status as a hallucinogenic guru of the 1960s. `` Well, to tell the truth, I've just taken some mushroom,'' <PERSON> Leary </PERSON> quipped as the Who stepped onto stage. The sold-out Universal Amphitheater show was the second of only two complete performances of `` Tommy'' scheduled on the 25-city reunion tour of the Who's <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON>. A well-dressed crowd of people in the 30s and 40s walked into the amphitheater reading warning signs that announced sound levels could cause hearing impairment. Only the faintest odor of a rare whiff of marijuana smoke could be detected. The saga of `` the deaf, dumb and blind kid'' who becomes a fantastic pinball player also featured <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, reprising his 1975 movie role as the Pinball Wizard, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Winwood </PERSON> as the Hawker, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> as Uncle <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Idol </PERSON> as <PERSON> Cousin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Labelle </PERSON> as Gypsy, the Acid Queen. The show, benefiting the <ORGANIZATION> Nordoff-Robbins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Therapy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, was available live on a pay-per-view basis for $ 19.95 per subscriber on <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> DIR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. The tour's first performance of `` Tommy'' was in June at Radio City Music Hall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and featured the band and supporting musicians. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyrowitz </PERSON>, president of DIR, said the show had a potential audience of 12.5 million households. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> performance was `` really mind-boggling,'' but the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> staging made the opera `` a much more musical piece,'' <PERSON> Meyrowitz </PERSON> said. The Who came together in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in 1964 and were a premiere rock band through the 1970s. Drummer <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> died in 1978 and the remaining members of the band retired in 1982 after a concert in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. Who albums between 1965 and 1982 included `` My Generation,'' `` Happy <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>,'' `` The Who Sell Out,'' `` On Tour: Magic Bus,'' `` <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>,'' `` Live at <LOCATION> Leeds </LOCATION>,'' `` Who's Next,'' `` Meaty, <PERSON> Beaty </PERSON>, Big and Bouncy,'' `` Quadrophenia,'' `` Odds and Sods,'' `` The Who by Numbers,'' `` Who Are You,'' `` The Kids Are Alright,'' `` Face Dances,'' and `` It's Hard.''

 A state law that would have barred the sale or rental of violent videotapes to children was blocked Thursday by a federal judge who said the measure might clash with the right of free speech. Under the law signed June 20 by Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, video retailers could be fined as much as $ 200 for renting or selling so-called `` slasher films,'' to children under age 17. The law was to take effect Monday. `` The gray areas are the important ones in this case, are n't they? said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brook </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>. `` Because that's where a prosecutor and store owner could have a difference of opinion that could get the store owner in trouble. The measure, which would also apply to videos considered pornographic under <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law, would require stores to maintain separate display areas for violent films. Video industry groups and retailers challenged the law with a class action lawsuit and sought the temporary restraining order, arguing that the law would force video store owners to decide by Monday which videos fell under the law. The lawsuit names Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Cole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> contends the law violates constitutional rights of free expression, equal protection and due process of law. The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law restricts videos that, based on contemporary community standards, would be interpreted by the average person to have `` a tendency to cater or appeal to morbid interest in violence'' for persons under 17, that depict violence that is `` patently offensive'' and lack `` serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.'' The lawsuit said the law would require video retailers to limit sale and rental of videos that are not obscene and not constitutionally subject to restriction under state or federal law. The lawsuit said terms such as `` violence'' and `` morbid'' have no certain meaning. It also criticized the law for applying arbitrarily to videos only, and not to identical expression in television, movie theaters and magazines. The lawsuit was filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grocers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and two retailers, <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>'s C.C. <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Researchers Suspect Hormone Link To Adult Diabetes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A hormone that may play a key role in developing the most common form of diabetes has been discovered by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> and Swedish researchers. The hormone, islet amyloid polypeptide, or IAPP, appears to impair the ability of insulin to regulate the level of sugar in the blood, causing the development of Type 2 or adult-onset diabetes, the researchers said in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. IAPP and insulin are secreted by the islet cells in the tail of the pancreas, the researchers said. With the discovery, the researchers hope to find better ways to treat Type 2 diabetes, which affects an estimated 10 million Americans and often leads to blindness, nerve and kidney damage, and amputations as the result of gangrene of the feet. The researchers are Drs. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who are <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> veterinary pathologists, and Drs. Per <PERSON> Westermark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christer </PERSON> <PERSON> Betsholtz </PERSON>, Swedish diabetes researchers. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Westermark </PERSON> first mentioned their discovery of the hormone in the 1987 Proceedings of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, subject to official confirmation by other laboratories. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Wednesday that other researchers quickly replicated the findings. The hormone was isolated from amyloid, a protein often found around degenerating human and animal tissue, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. The researchers found amyloid in microscopic quantities surrounding the insulin-secreting islet cells of pancreases of diabetic humans and cats. He said the amyloid tissue around the pancreases of diabetics was reported in the early 1900s, but that researchers were puzzled about its role for more than 80 years because amyloid also was found around the pancreases of people who were not diabetic. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> began looking at the amyloid of diabetic cats 20 years ago, and 12 years ago he and <PERSON> Westermark </PERSON>, who worked with human cadaver pancreases, began collaborating. They found there were differences between the amyloid of diabetics and the amyloid of non-diabetics. Three years ago, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Westermark </PERSON> were able to purify IAPP from the amyloid surrounding insulin-secreting cells. IAPP, like insulin, is produced by normal pancreatic cells, but <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said the researchers have evidence that an excessive amount is produced in adult-onset diabetics. It is likely that IAPP is just one of many hormones secreted by the islet cells of the pancreas involved in balancing the level of blood sugar, he said. `` We've found IAPP in virtually every species we have looked at _ humans, dogs, cats, guinea pigs,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` Presumably it has an important role in healthy, normal people.''

<TEXT>
 Mr. <PERSON> Speaker </PERSON>, High Chamber. I want to form a government capable of acting for the good of society, the nation and the state. Today such a task can be undertaken only by a government open for cooperation of all forces represented in parliament and based on new political principles. The history of our country is accelerating. It has happened due to a society which does not agree to continuing life as it has been until now. One has to return to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> the mechanisms of normal political life. The transition is difficult, but it does not have to cause shaking. On the contrary, it will be a path to normalcy. The principle of struggle, which sooner or later leads to elimination of one's opponent, must be replaced by a principle of partnership. We will not pass from the totalitarian system to democratic one in any other way. The current philosophy of the state must be changed. It can not take care of everything and guarantee everything. It should facilitate and regulate activities. The most important role for the government and administration at this moment is opening possibilities for common actions and individual actions. I want to be the prime minister of all Poles, regardless of their views and convictions, which must not be a criterion for dividing citizens into categories. I will undertake efforts so that the principles of constructing the government will be clear to all. I am especially obliged to do that for Solidarity. Helpful will be the understanding of the church, which has always stood in defense of human rights and has felt the worries of the nation as its own. The church was and is a stabilizing force in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The future government must be truthful to society. It must also create mechanisms which will allow it to hear the voice of public opinion. We will pass certain problems to its judgment. If sacrifices are necessary, all must know their sense, understand them and be able to express their opinions on the problems occurring. High Chamber, The most important issue for society is the condition of the national economy, which now has to be considered critical. How bad it is and why _ already everything has been said about it. The problem is how to get out of it. I am fully aware of the great effort that repairing the economy will require of the new government and everybody. The long-term, strategic goal of government's activities will be restoring to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> economic institutions long known and tested. I understand by this a return to a market-oriented economy and a role for the state similar to that in economically developed countries. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> can not afford ideological experiments any longer. Any changes, on which the nation's prospects and citizens' welfare depend, are blocked today by inflation and the lack of an economic balance manifested by poor market supplies and queues, a state budget deficit and an unbalanced balance of payments Restoring equilibrium and stifling inflation is a task of utmost economic importance, as well as political and social significance. Disequilibrium and inflation, increasing social tensions, can undermine the Polish march to freedom. With high inflation there can be no discussion about creating normal working conditions for the nation, on which its material existence mainly will depend. The government, sensing an absolute and urgent need to challenge inflation, will prepare a package of required measures, utilizing what has been tried so far in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and in other countries, as well as by referring to the experience of international experts and financial organizations. We will start without delay demonopolizing the structures serving the food market, the excessive growth of which is one of the causes of high prices and halting rural development. Struggling with inflation and restoring market balance has always and everywhere been risky for government and painful for society. Keeping in mind the effectivness of the anti-inflation operation, the government will do everything to make it as painless as possible. One can not promise, however, that it will not be felt at all. Nobody responsibly can make such an offer. Poles themselves have to solve Polish problems. Our own ingenuity, work and patience _ our own effort _ will determine our success. This does not mean that we are doomed to be alone in this difficult undertaking. The world is watching the transformations taking place here with sympathy and hope. The government will aim energetically at obtaining as much economic support for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> from the international community as possible, in all possible forms, according to existing procedures and customs. We will not apply for privileges denied others in a similar situation to ours. We will, however, expect the maximum possible support of our efforts to cure the economy. Governments by themselves do not create economic success for their nations and do not alone end economic crises. Many a government by stifling the initiative of citizens and trying to direct everyone and everything effectively overpowered the country economically. However, there have been and there are governments that release the economic energy dormant in talented and diligent people.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a symbol of the astounding change in the Communist world, has emerged as a cautious, conciliatory negotiator who admits he is frightened by the challenge ahead. `` A lot of things terrify me,'' he said as he paused after his nomination last week to contemplate his momentous mission. The first non-Communist prime minister to head an East bloc government, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> faces awesome responsibility. He must negotiate the competing demands of factions long at ideological odds while confronting economic disaster and inspiring a populace that has exhausted its faith in government of any stripe. `` At first I felt as if someone had put 100 kilos of stones on my head,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said. `` But I calmed down and started looking with a certain optimism. Otherwise, I could not take on this role.'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was proposed as the head of a governing coalition by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, for whom <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> has been a close adviser since the founding of the independent union during shipyard strikes in 1980. The 62-year-old lawyer and journalist, a lifelong anti-Communist with close ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, was not among the most public Solidarity leaders. Nothing could have prepared him for the hopes now centered on him. He has responded with remarkable calm. There have been no fiery speeches, nor radical announcements. His diplomacy may smooth the delicate transition, or it may disappoint those waiting to be ignited. Although his demeanor has been mild, those who know him say he can be tough. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s Solidarity activism earned him a year in prison after the martial-law crackdown imposed in 1981 by <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the Communist president who nominated him as prime minister Saturday. But associates say he was not embittered. His approach to the weakened but still crucial <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> so far has been to play down differences and offer compromise. There has been little sense of triumph. `` I think we should be mutually open to each other, and aim at a situation where no reluctance and aggression take place between us. Because what <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs now is a joint effort of all forces,'' he said after hearing of a sharply worded resolution from the party. To the Polish people, he has offered a mix of hope and realism, asking them to `` believe that it can be better in this country'' while acknowledging: `` Society has no concept how difficult it will be to reform this economy.'' Graying and dignified, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> appears solemn, serious and even cool. But he has shown humor and a human side during the tense week, joking about running out of gas while driving _ `` not fitting for a premier'' _ and craving a cigarette away from the cameras. The widowed father of three sons who has four grandchildren, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was editing Solidarity's weekly newspaper when history turned to him. He had founded the newspaper during the union's first legal months in 1980 and resurrected it when Solidarity was legalized again in April. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had entrusted him with a major role in the negotiations between the opposition and the Communist authorities that led to restoration of Solidarity's legal status and the freest parliament elections in post-war <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. He was in charge of the talks on trade union issues. This spring, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> chose to remain an editor rather than run for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. He had been a Sejm deputy from 1961 to 1970 as a member of ZNAK, an officially condoned delegation under the church's protection that supported regeneration of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> based on Catholic values. In 1971, when he tried unsuccessfully to establish a <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> commission to study the violent repression of strikes that swept the Baltic coast following price increases in December 1970, he overstepped official tolerance and was denied another term. Born April 18, 1927, to an intelligentsia family in the small central <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> city of Plock, <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. By age 21, in the early years of Communist <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he was dismissed from his academic editing house job for links too close to the church. He began to work for PAX, set up by the government to dilute church-based opposition but one of the few venues for independent thought. By 1955, he had been dismissed for criticizing the mix of politics and religion. In 1958 he founded the Wiez, or Link, a progressive <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> monthly magazine that he edited until 1981. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligentsia </ORGANIZATION> he helped found in 1957 became the core of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> fight against to communist ideology. On Aug. 22, 1980, he arrived at the strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> and after a nightlong session with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, he took charge of a group of experts advising the workers on organizing the union. He stayed with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the movement through seven years of resistance. In the Council of Minister building during his first hours as prime minister, he recalled walking out of the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> with workers in disappoinment after an unfruitful occupation strike in May 1988. `` I think that neither them nor I thought that exit would lead to my entrance here today,'' he said.

<HEAD>Researchers Discover Gene for Cystic Fibrosis, May Suggest New Treatments</HEAD>

 Researchers who isolated the gene that causes cystic fibrosis say the discovery may lead to breakthrough therapy within the lifetimes of young people now suffering from the disease. `` This is a milestone of the highest order, but it does not have applications for the doctor's office tomorrow,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a co-discoverer of the cystic fibrosis gene. Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON>, director of the CF research program at the Hospital for <ORGANIZATION> Sick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, said that finding the gene means that `` within the lifetime of CF sufferers, we can now say it's possible that drugs will be discovered'' to treat the fundamental condition causing the disease. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ann </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Lap-Chee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsui </PERSON>, also of the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> research institute, announced Thursday they had isolated the gene responsible for CF. In cooperative research at labs in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, they also discovered a mutation in the gene that causes production of a defective protein that leads to symptoms of the disease. A report of their finding is to be published in the Sept. 8 edition of Science, the journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Science. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dresing </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cystic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibrosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and father of <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>, a 22-year-old with CF, said the discovery gives a burst of hope for treatment of a disease that has been largely untreatable. `` Now I can look in <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON>'s eyes and say we going to cure this disease and you will be a beneficiary,'' <PERSON> Dresing </PERSON> said at the news conference. The remark received long applause from a audience that included a number of cystic fibrosis patients and their parents. Cystic fibrosis is the most common lethal genetic disease of young people in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, afflicting about 30,000. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said that 1,000 to 1,200 new cases, usually children, are diagnosed annually. The disease causes the formation of a thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and digestive tract, blocking breathing and digestion. Half of its victims die before their mid-20s. Treatment of the disease has been symptomatic, with drugs and therapy designed to control the thick mucus and to help patients avoid or combat repeated lung infections that often kill. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said treating the specific cause of the disease was caught in a `` bottleneck'' because the precise gene and the flaw that caused the disease were not known. `` That bottleneck has been passed through now,'' he said at a news conference on Thursday. First use of the new knowledge, said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, will be to develop a screening test to identify the 12 million or so Americans who unknowingly carry the defective gene and can pass it along to their offspring. He said about 5 percent of the white population are carriers of the gene. CF occurs in a child only if it inherits two defective genes, one from each parent. The parents can each carry one defective gene and remain healthy, but there is a 25 percent chance that a child from the couple will have CF. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said a genetic test could be developed to help couples determine if their children were at risk of inheriting the CF gene. `` It's going to be possible and very soon,'' he said. <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said the researchers found a specific mutation in 70 percent of the chromosomes carrying the CF gene. This flaw, he said, caused the gene to create a protein that lacks an amino acid called phenylalanine. The flawed protein, now called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, somehow distorts the transport of charged particles across the cell membranes of some organs. This, in turn, plays a role in formation of the thick mucus. <PERSON> Riordan </PERSON> said the researchers now must determine the gene mutation that causes the other 30 percent of CF-related problems. Once this is understood, he said, researchers may be able to develop a therapy, perhaps some type of protein replacement, that will correct the flawed mucus secretion. Ultimately, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said, the discovery of the defective gene may help researchers correct the genetic flaw itself. This would mean permanently fixing the defect within the gene so that it would start producing the correct protein. Genes are segments within the threadlike structures called chromosomes. The CF gene was found on what is called chromosome 7. `` A gene therapy will take quite a bit of time -LRB- to develop -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. `` That is a path that has never been trod before for any disease.''

<HEAD>State Department Guides Diplomats on Sitting, Standing, Speaking</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is advising its diplomats that while they need n't splurge on their wardrobe for overseas duty, shoes are a must. <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women going abroad, as diplomats or their spouses, are also advised to remove their gloves while eating or drinking at a formal function. This is some of the advice in a pamphlet entitled `` Social Usage Abroad'' given to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives to help prepare them for foreign postings. The leaflet illustrates how protocol, that French invention which greases the wheels of statehood, can be a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat's biggest nightmare. It also makes clear that proper behavior within the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic community abroad is just as tricky as behavior toward officials of the host country. The diplomat's training begins well before departure from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It is customary when assigned to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission abroad to write to the principal officer -LRB- usually the ambassador -RRB- ... to express personal pleasure in the assignment,'' the guide advises. Wives -LRB- or husbands -RRB- of diplomats should do the same to the wife -LRB- or husband -RRB- of the principal officer. A new member of the embassy staff must call on the ambassador or chief officer within two working days, according to the manual. `` An expensive or extensive wardrobe is not necessary'' for junior diplomats. `` It is advisable, however, for newcomers to bring along a basic wardrobe, including shoes, because they will often be too busy on arrival to shop for new clothes.'' As for the dress code: for a daytime ceremony, `` a woman's shoulders should be covered. And in countries where gloves are worn for all daytime social occasions, `` it is useful to remember that they are always removed entirely for eating or drinking.'' Ambassadors, in addition to familiarizing themselves with treaties and other aspects of bilateral relations, must remember to take the place closest to the curbside when entering a car. When making social calls on officials of the host country in their homes, the American's calling card is left on a hall table `` and a caller should stay no longer than 20 minutes unless strongly urged.'' The pamphlet does n't explain how to judge whether such entreaties are `` strong.'' What it does do is answer every question `` ever put to us,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbord </PERSON>, relocation adviser for the Overseas Briefing Center. The center, run by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, provides extensive reading materials on conditions in foreign countries, regulations of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign service, etiquette, educational and health facilities, and other information. Some 14,000 people, or about half of the Americans sent abroad last year by various government agencies, used the center in 1988, she said. The center also offers a mandatory two-day seminar on security overseas, and even a course designed to help teenagers adjust to life abroad, <PERSON> Forbord </PERSON> said. For American hostesses abroad, the pitfalls are numerous. Making a dinner table seating plan is `` full of complexities,'' warn the authors of the pamphlet. Hostesses should check with the embassy protocol officer to ensure they have not inadvertently planned to seat together people from countries which do not maintain diplomatic relations, for example. A proper seating arrangement requires mathematical talent. `` To seat eight, 12, 16 or 20 persons without two men or two women sitting together, the hostess sits to the left of the seat that is properly hers.'' Is that clear? Now, if the women are served before the men, the woman on the host's right is served first and the woman on the host's left is served second. Try explaining that to the servants. One also should be aware that an invitation for 8 o'clock does n't necessarily mean you show up at 8 In some countries, it's a signal to turn up at 9:30. `` At official dinners in certain <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> countries, it is rude to smoke at the table before the toast to the Queen.'' And speaking of toasts, `` it is a good idea to leave enough wine in the glass at the end of the meal to join in the drinking'' of such salutations. And in case your parents neglected to tell you, the guide advises that `` before leaving, each guest should thank those hosting the party.'' Then there are ambiguities. For instance, men always rise when being introduced and when a woman enters the room. But `` whether a woman rises to be introduced to another woman is a more complicated question'' depending on age, social position, etc. The guide, however, does n't advise whether a woman should rise when being introduced to a man. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Post </PERSON>, help!

<TEXT>
 It's a quintessentially South African paradox. <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> has been ordered closed for lack of pupils, yet its neighborhood abounds with schoolgirls who wish they could enroll. Throughout its 102-year existence, the inner-city school has been open only to whites. Now, with closure imminent because of white flight to the suburbs, its students, teachers and parents are petitioning for it to become <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s first multiracial government-run school. `` We should prove to the rest of the world we can do it,'' said <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, a 15-year-old student excited by the idea of black classmates. `` Our school should feel privileged if it could be the first.'' The government has given no sign it will be swayed by the `` Save Our School'' campaign, even though organizers say they have gathered 12,000 signatures supporting integration at the city's oldest high school. But <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, mother of <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> and chairman of the campaign, says she hopes that mounting pressure might prompt the government to reconsider its decision to close the school in December. On a brick wall at the school was a poster with the initials S.O.S. _ for `` Save Our School'' _ and a crayon drawing showing a white girl and black girl side by side, dressed in the school's uniform The school was built to accommodate 630 students, and now has 203. It is in the heart of the country's largest `` gray area,'' where thousands of black and Indian families have moved in defiance of residential segregation laws. Acting President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, favored to win a full five-year term after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections, says he opposes discrimination and favors legalization of selected multiracial neighborhoods. But he has recommitted himself to the concept of segregated public schools. Asked about <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, he said children should have `` mother-tongue education among people of their own community.'' Parents who wanted multiracial education could send their children to integrated, state-subsidized private schools, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. But Mrs. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said most girls at the high school were from low-income or single-parent families and could not afford the cost of private schools. The parent-elected management council at <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> has been criticized by some parents for failing to consult the school community fully before it advised the government to either integrate the facility or close it. But council chairman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said the declining enrollment left no other option. `` It was n't educationally viable anymore,'' he said. `` We could n't offer the variety of subjects you need in a high school like that.'' `` It's a great, great pity,'' he added. `` The facilities are all there. It seems crazy not to utilize them.'' The school is a spacious complex of modern red-brick buildings on the border of <LOCATION> Hillbrow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Berea </LOCATION>, two neighborhoods dominated by high-rise apartment buildings. They officially are designated as `` whites only,'' but an estimated 60,000 blacks, Indians and people of mixed race have moved in and the government has virtually halted enforcement of residential segregation laws in the area. However, no state schools have been established for these non-white families. Their children must either go to costly private schools or commute long distances to crowded, poorly equipped public schools in outlying townships. Mrs. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said some black children spend nearly four hours daily commuting to and from schools in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, southwest of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. If it closes, <ORGANIZATION> Johannesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> could be the first of many. A new study by education specialists at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatwersrand </ORGANIZATION> said 42 of the city's 175 white schools are at risk of closure within five years because of declining enrollments. The study calculated that there were 13,150 vacant places for students in the city's schools.

<HEAD>Monkeys Lose Cocaine Interest After Buprenorphine Shots, Researcher
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pain-reliever that causes laboratory monkeys to lose interest in cocaine may now be tested to see if it can help human addicts lose the craving for drugs, researchers say in an article published today. Researchers at a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> drug abuse research center report that five Rhesus monkeys that had been dosing themselves regularly with cocaine chose to ignore the drug after receiving injections of buprenorphine. The study appears in the journal Science. Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON>, a co-investigator in the research, said as a result of the animals' response to buprenorphine, clinical studies are proposed to determine if the analgesic will help people overcome dependence on cocaine and heroin. `` We feel that it -LRB- buprenorphine -RRB- may provide an opportunity for some persons to stop using cocaine and not feel the adverse effects of cessation,'' <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` This would provide a window in time for someone who might be able to stop using the drug and ultimately become drug-free.'' In the laboratory studies, five Rhesus monkeys were fitted with intravenous catheters that were connected to pumps operated by levers. Each monkey, if it chose to, could press the lever and receive a small dose of cocaine. `` The monkeys self-administer cocaine, but are under no compulsion to do so,'' <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> said. `` It is completely an elective act.'' He said earlier studies showed that when given this choice, nine out of 10 Rhesus monkeys will press the lever for cocaine, though they will choose not to self-administer some other types of pharmaceuticals. <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> said that when the five test monkeys received injections of buprenorphine, their cocaine use rapidly declined, and approached zero use at some doses of the buprenorphine. When a type of placebo, saline solution, was injected, the monkeys chose to press the cocaine lever repeatedly. `` The placebo did n't do anything,'' <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> said. `` But the buprenorphine suppressed the cocaine self-administration.'' At the same time, he said, the monkeys continued to press another lever to receive banana pellets, and otherwise behaved normally while taking the buprenorphine. `` It does n't produce the behavior changes and its safety is enormous,'' said the researcher. <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> said buprenorphine may be particularly useful in weaning abusers away from `` speedball,'' a combination of heroin and cocaine that is becoming more widely used by drug-dependent people. `` We've tried -LRB- buprenorphine -RRB- in heroin-dependent persons and most of them report they can detect that they've had a drug, but it does n't produce the degree of euphoria and certainly not the rush of a drug like heroin or methadone,'' he said. `` Most of the people who are heroin-dependent who have used the drug report that they do n't feel high, but they feel normal. The factors of drug addiction are highly complex and stopping dependence is not easy, <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON> said. Though it appears that buprenorphine would not become a `` substitute addiction'' for cocaine, he said, it does not represent a `` magic bullet'' for the effortless control of substance abuse, but possibly only an aide for controlling such dependence. `` Some people,'' he noted, `` will abuse chicken soup.'' Buprenorphine is commonly used in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for relief of moderate pain, and is used in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals as an injectable pain reliever. <ORGANIZATION> Norwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> markets it as the prescription drug Buprenex. The Rhesus monkey study was coauthored by <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bree </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON>, all researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School-McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> drug abuse research center in <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pentagon Provides List of Possible Hardware for Colombia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Joint Chiefs of Staff have sent the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a list of military hardware that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could send to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> if that country seeks such aid in its war against drugs, sources say. The Joint Chiefs met Thursday to draw up the list, which includes UH-1 `` Huey'' troop transport helicopters, ammunition and radio equipment, said a military source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Colombian officials were expected to meet in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to discuss how the two nations can cooperate in the anti-drug battle. An administration source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, stressed that no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel were included in the Joint Chiefs' suggestions. This, he said, was in line with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s complaint that talk of such an idea had gotten `` out of whack.'' Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has also rejected the idea of seeking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops. The administration official said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could do other things to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in its battle against drug terrorists _ such as offering training to members of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> military and police forces. But, he cautioned, `` we are n't going to do anything unless the Colombians say they want it.'' The military source said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters _ which were widely used in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war and are being replaced by the more sophisticated Blackhawk choppers _ must be flown by <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> pilots since no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel will be involved. No precise numbers were disclosed, but the source said the amount of helicopters that could be provided was `` not extravagant.'' The administration source said the list was not a formal recommendation, but instead provides the president with `` a laundry list of items that the Pentagon could provide if called upon to do so.'' The official said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s suggestions came amid those offered by other agencies, such as a $ 2 million <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> program designed to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> protect judges and other officials threatened by the drug cartel. The military source noted that the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>' list is over and above the aid provided to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> through the Foreign Military Sales program. Under the FMS program, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has sold <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s government almost $ 210 million worth of military goods and services since 1963, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday The focus of the sales have been the helicopters, ammunition, spare parts and support for the choppers. The Colombian government has requested that the <LOCATION> Export-Import </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> provide a loan guarantee for approximately $ 200 million, and the proceeds of loans obtained under the guarantee would finance additional FMS purchases for the counter-narcotics programs, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is expected to purchase additional UH-60 and UH-1 helicopters, patrol boats, rifles, machine guns, ammunition, vehicles and spare parts as part of this program, the Pentagon said. In the 1988 fiscal year, a total of 775 Colombian military personnel were trained under the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and Training program, while 898 Colombian military received such training so far this fiscal year, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> steeled herself for the worst but still found she was unprepared when the Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered her husband deported to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We fought it for more a year,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> said, her voice shaking. `` Even though I expected it day by day, still I was shocked.'' The 28-year-old Palestinian nursery school teacher learned from Israeli radio news that an appeal by her husband, physics professor <PERSON> Taysir </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>, was rejected by the court Thursday. He is accused of being a leader of the Palestinian uprising. The deportation order is expected to be carried out within a week and could mean a long separation for the family. Mrs. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> has no passport and fears she will not get special travel passes from the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military government. `` I have n't told the children yet,'' she said in an interview, adding she was waiting `` until we can sit alone together ... maybe at bedtime.'' On Thursday, the sitting room in the family's white stone house was crowded with relatives who came to lend support and distract the three <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> children, ages 2 to 7, while Mrs. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> talked with lawyers and reporters. <PERSON> Taysir </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>, a 43-year-old physicist at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was served on Aug. 17, 1988, with a deportation order signed by Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>. He has been jailed since in Juneid Prison near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> was never tried but was accused by the army of being a member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and of being `` involved in planning the intefadeh and a member of the unified command of the intefadeh.'' `` Intefadeh'' is the Arabic word for the uprising Palestinians have been waging since December 1987 against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> does not hear arguments in deportation cases and only decides if the army acted properly. The court has never overturned a deportation order. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has adopted <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> as a `` prisoner of conscience,'' and hundreds of scientists in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> signed petitions and launched a letter-writing campaign on his behalf. `` Maybe they did n't know they were dealing with a very cold government here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> said. Her husband was one of four Palestinians whose petitions were rejected Thursday. The others are <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Maali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Majed </PERSON> <PERSON> Labadi </PERSON>, both union organizers, and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Matur </PERSON>, a teacher. <PERSON> Labidi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, also a union leader, was expelled in June The new expulsions to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> will raise the number of deportees to 59. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and international human rights groups have said repeatedly that the practice violates international law. This was not <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>'s first run-in with Israeli authorities. He was jailed from 1974 to 1978 without charge or trial under Israeli administrative detention procedures. Then, too, he was championed by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. Asked about the allegation that her husband is a leader of the uprising, Mrs. <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON> said: `` I think every Palestinian is a leader of the intefadeh.

Petitions on <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>'s behalf, including one signed by nearly 1,000 foreign scientists and published in the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in May, describe him as `` a man of peace.''

<TEXT>
 Things are so bad for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official assigned to that issue, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, is being dubbed by irreverent colleagues as the `` deputy secretary for disasters.'' Eighteen months have passed since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began its effort to dislodge Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power. But it seemed easier to negotiate the departure of 100,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> than it has been to uproot a single Panamanian. Elsewhere in the world the picture looks much more promising for administration policy. The Soviet empire, for example, has shown clear signs of unraveling, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> continues to reign in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, smugly defying the wishes of his opponents in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has held four foreign ministers' meetings on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> attended the first but assigned the following three to <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s second-ranking official. It has been a thankless task. Under heavy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prodding, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> in May held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> responsible for the `` grave events'' surrounding national elections, in which opposition candidates were deprived of an apparent victory and then beaten by government agents days later. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> statement encouraged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials but as time passed, the number of countries willing to take a strong stand against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> steadily diminished. Among others, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> felt that the principles of non-intervention should outweigh all other considerations in dealing with internal problems in member states. More than any other country, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> knows the price of foreign interventionism, having lost half its territory 140 years ago to its powerful northern neighbor. There was no OAS at the time to put a brake on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territorial ambitions. There was not much left of the anti-Noriega indignation by the time the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> ministers convened this week for the fourth time to discuss the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> situation. Indeed, <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediators given the task of promoting a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> issued a report that left <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials gasping in disbelief. The report, far from criticizing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, did not even mention him by name and instead concluded that the blame for the lack of progress rested with none other than the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The study said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military maneuvers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> had a `` negative effect'' on the negotiating process and were `` inopportune.'' In response, the administration acknowledged that the maneuvers did indeed take place but were consistent with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treaty responsibilities to protect the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. In private, officials expressed incredulity that the mediators were unwilling to take a more assertive stance against a strongman who, they alleged, stole an election, tramples on the human rights of his people and does business with Colombian drug dealers and leftist guerrillas in that country. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> has its list of grievances against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, accusing the administration of trifling with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s sovereign rights through a variety of coercive measures, including economic sanctions. As <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> sees it, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military maneuvers are aimed less at protecting the canal than intimidating <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Not surprisingly, feelings were running high Wednesday and early Thursday morning when the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers assembled to discuss the situation. <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>, reaching deep into his rhetorical bag, likened <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and said the Panamanian runs an `` outlaw regime.'' Panamanian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> stormed out of the meeting hall during <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON>'s presentation, leaving a deputy, <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, to rebut. For two hours, <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> ranted about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> predatory activities and challenged <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> to prove his allegations about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s role in drug smuggling. But <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> had long since left his seat and was seen stalking the hallway, smoking a cigarette, his translation device nowhere in sight. It was 2:30 a.m., and <PERSON> Eagleburger </PERSON> had the look of a man who wished he were elsewhere.

<HEAD>Contra Appeals Court Rules on Torture-Murder Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Contra spokesman predicts the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will object to a rebel appeals court decision that exonerates a top commander found guilty in March of covering up a murder. The Contra court, made up of four civilian lawyers living in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, also upheld the conviction of one Contra commander and reduced charges against four others in a torture-murder case, rebel spokesman <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said Thursday. Five of the six Contras were given dishonorable discharges _ the stiffest penalty that can be handed out by the Contra internal court system that was set up in 1987. Leniency was recommended for one, according to a document obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. It could not be independently confirmed if the expulsions were carried out. Meanwhile, the rebels fired their chief representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazio </PERSON>, charging him with abuses of Contra funds that <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said could run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Palazio, believed to be in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, could not immediately be reached for comment. A 1986 law prohibits U.S.-supplied aid to any group that includes a person `` found to engage in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.'' A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the appeal would be reviewed. `` If they are guilty and maintained in the resistance, that creates a problem,'' the official said. `` We will review the verdict of the appeals tribunal and see what procedures were followed and how they arrived at their decision.'' <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said he expected the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to object to the dismissal of charges that Commander <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, the chief of intelligence for the Contras, covered up a murder. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was a member of the national guard under the late Nicaraguan dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> reportedly violated a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> order that he be suspended from his duties until after the appeal. The Contra tribunal found that rebel commander <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Blacker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, known as Israelita, `` had the premeditated intention of murdering <ORGANIZATION> Managua </ORGANIZATION> 2,'' a man who was killed in November 1988. The victim was suspected of being an agent of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Sandinista government The six Contras were charged in March by a Contra court in connection with the murder and several rapes in northern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pressed for the investigation. The lawyers upheld charges of torture and cruel and inhuman punishment against Israelita, as well as Contras known as Rambo, Pandillero, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>. The judges recommended leniency for <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON>, saying he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> ranks at age 15 and lost an eye in the fight. The rebels, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981, have been fighting to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Matamoros </PERSON> said he did not know the whereabouts of the expelled commanders but believed they were in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Forecasters Say Utilities Must Build Many More Power Plants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Electric utilities in the coming decade will have to build at least twice as much generating capacity as previously planned to meet the nation's growing appetite for electricity, an industry group says. In an otherwise bright outlook for energy supplies and prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> will face a serious squeeze in electricity. `` The likelihood of a shortfall in electric utility generating capacity, particularly in the near term, to the year 2000 and through the 1990s, is very high,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON>, the group's vice president for strategic planning and analysis He said an electricity pinch in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> was `` now virtually unavoidable,'' because demand would outstrip supply before new power plants can be built. Even if the nation's electricity use grows relatively slowly to 2000, electric utilities will have to build at least 45 gigawatts of new capacity _ roughly equivalent to 45 new large-scale power plants _ beyond the 46 gigawatts of capacity already on the drawing board, the report said. The research group, sponsored by natural gas pipeline and distribution companies, also said the big increase in world oil prices that many forecasters have projected for the mid-1990s is unlikely to hit before the turn of the century. A key reason for expecting a longer period of stable prices, it said, is that oil production in high-cost fields, such as the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, has remained strong. Some high-cost production has been lost _ particularly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ but the overall decline has been smaller than expected after the 1986 price crash. Oil prices by 1995 are likely to be about $ 18 a barrel in current dollars, rising to about $ 20 a barrel by 2000, the group said. Oil is selling for about $ 18 a barrel, up from about $ 15 a barrel last year. A faster price escalation is likely after the turn of the century, <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> said, as world oil demand moves closer into balance with available supplies. The forecast said the price, in current dollars, would be about $ 32 a barrel in 2010. Low oil prices during the 1990s imply a generally stable price for all types of energy, including natural gas, coal and products made from oil, such as gasoline, the forecast said. This is because oil is the most versatile and dominant energy source. The report also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil imports would reach 13.4 million barrels a day by 2010, nearly double the current rate and meeting about two-thirds of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil needs.

<HEAD>Lingering Drought Draining Grain Reserves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This year's lingering drought in major wheat areas continues to drain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain reserves and push up market prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says in a new analysis. Moreover, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday, world stockpiles are in similar shape, with wheat reserves the lowest since the mid-1970s. The analysis was based on the Aug. 10 estimate that wheat production would be about 2.04 billion bushels, up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest. Wheat use, including exports, is expected to be 2.29 billion bushels in the marketing year that began June 1, down 5 percent from 1988-89. `` With <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm prices expected near the target price -LRB- $ 4 per bushel -RRB- in 1989-90, and increased competitor supplies, exports may decline more than 10 percent to less than 1.3 billion bushels,'' the report said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of world trade is expected to slip as well.'' At the end of the 1988-89 wheat marketing year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had about 694 million bushels from previous harvests in its stockpile. And this June 1 `` carryover'' was down from more than 1.26 billion bushels a year earlier. By next June 1, the report said, the wheat stockpile will be trimmed further to an estimated 474 million bushels, down more than 30 percent and the smallest carryover since 1974-75. Most of the reduction will occur in the inventories held by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as forfeited collateral for price support loans made to producers. Other reductions will be in the `` farmer-owned reserve'' of wheat stored under loan and released to the market as prices rise and the loans become due. `` Area planted increased 17 percent in response to attractive prices and less acreage idled under annual government programs, but yields are forecast to be the lowest since 1978'' because of lingering drought in major wheat production areas, the report said. Because of the continued tight wheat supply, the government has lowered the land-idling requirement for 1990 to 5 percent of the base acreage, down from 10 percent for 1989 and 27.5 percent in 1988. That is land farmers must take from production to qualify for federal supports. Wheat prices are projected to average in the range of $ 3.85 to $ 4.25 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, up from $ 3.72 estimated for 1988-89. `` The global wheat situation is similar to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` World production is forecast up 26.5 million tons to 527 million metric tons in 1989-90. However, consumption is expected to outpace production for the third consecutive year, reducing stocks to their lowest since 1975-76.'' Relatively high export prices are expected, but `` world demand for imported wheat is likely to remain strong,'' the report said.

 Egg production continues to drop, meaning higher prices for consumers, according the latest <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates. July production was 5.63 billion eggs, down 2 percent from a year earlier, a report said Thursday. Production included 4.89 billion eggs for the table and 738 million for hatching. As of Aug. 1, the laying flock was about 264.2 million birds, down 2 percent from a year ago. However, production averaged 68.1 eggs per 100 birds, virtually the same as a year earlier, the report said. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says in a related report that total egg production this year is expected to decline about 2 percent. The agency earlier forecast a 3 percent drop, but `` net returns continue to be positive and are likely to remain so for the rest of the year.'' As a result, `` flock rebuilding is expected to bring about a larger-than-expected increase in table egg production during the fourth quarter,'' the report said. Egg production in the third quarter of this year is expected to be only about 1 percent below a year ago, and may increase about 1 percent from a year earlier during the fourth quarter. Wholesale egg prices are up sharply from a year ago and should maintain their strength through September before coming down in the fourth quarter as supplies increase. The agency predicts that 1989 consumer prices of eggs will average 15 percent to 20 percent higher than in 1988, when prices gained 2.3 percent. Retail egg prices dropped 5.9 percent in 1987 and then began climbing as financially pressed producers cut back on flocks. Retail egg prices had increased 6.9 percent in 1986, after a 16.6 percent plummet in 1985.

 The minister wo n't have to tell <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gubler </PERSON> he may kiss the bride when he and his fiancee get married at noon Saturday. <PERSON> Gubler </PERSON>, 23, and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, 25, both of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, have had their lips locked at least 12 hours a day since Aug. 12 as contestants in the Great Amercian Kiss-Off Contest in a furniture store's parking lot. <PERSON> Gubler </PERSON>, an auto body shop foreman, and Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who works in a retail store, said Thursday the only thing that worries them about tying the knot during the contest is that the vows wo n't be read fast enough. `` We're concerned about the time factor since we only receive five minutes per hour break time,'' <PERSON> Gubler </PERSON> said in between smooches. The couple is trying to accumulate break time for the wedding ceremony; but if they must, they'll just say muffled `` I dos'' with lips touching. Under rules of the contest, in its 14th day, couples must kiss for 12 hours a day, 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the contest, quipped that the official who conducts the wedding will probably tell the couple, `` You may kiss the bride _ for another 30 days in a row.'' <PERSON> Gubler </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> are one of six hardy couples among a starting 15 who are still in the contest, which has become more than a lark for those counting on the $ 10,000 top prize. `` There are some people competing out here who really need the money,'' Ms. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` Right now, it appears that the six couples left will go on forever.'' <PERSON> Menette </PERSON> <PERSON> McVey </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, wo n't be able to last too long, however. She's nearly eight months pregnant and is relying on the $ 10,000 to pay hospitals bills when she gives birth. In applying to enter the contest, Ms. <PERSON> McVey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Knapp </PERSON>, 20, her kissing partner and father of the baby, both simply put `` baby'' for the reason why they entered the contest. Contestant <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, 25, of <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, lost her bank job this week because the contest was going on too long, said <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, spokesman for the Kiss-Off. She's counting on the money to use during a job search. `` I guess she did n't tell the bank she was going to enter this until about a week before and they were n't too happy,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. Her partner, <PERSON> Bret </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 26, is a financial planner and apparently is making good use of his kissing time by plotting ways to make money. He's reading `` Think and Grow Rich'' among other books.

<HEAD>Fed Allows Bank Holding Companies to Buy Healthy S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A unanimous <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> vote allowing bank holding companies to buy healthy thrifts is being described as `` another nail in the coffin'' of an independent savings and loan industry. Still, the decision was widely expected after enactment two weeks ago of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout legislation, and thrift officials are looking on the bright side. The 6-0 ruling Thursday will bring more money from commercial banks into the troubled savings business. `` The healthy institutions are happy to have more people interested in their stock,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobe </PERSON>, research director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, which opposed the rule when it was proposed two years ago. Under the federal regulatory scheme, banks and savings associations were kept strictly separate until 1982, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided to allow bank holding companies to buy ailing thrifts. In September 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> proposed opening all thrifts to purchase by banks but delayed its decision after it ran into a barrage of criticism from S & amp; Ls, small banks and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. When the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration originally drafted its S & amp; L bill six months ago, it had called for a two-year delay before banks could buy healthy S & amp; Ls on the theory that banks would n't want to buy ailing thrifts if they had the chance to buy sound institutions. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> scrapped the waiting period in an effort to entice banks into investing in marginal, but still solvent, savings associations. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION>, says solvent S & amp; Ls will have to raise $ 30 billion to meet new capital requirements going into effect by the end of the year. He estimated that half of the approximately 2,600 solvent S & amp; Ls in the nation, representing 85 percent of the industry's assets, fall short of the new standard. However, critics warn that thrifts owned by banks may de-emphasize home mortgage lending and eventually convert to banks. `` This just adds another nail to the coffin ... of a separate thrift industry,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, director of regulatory affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents community banks. The independent bankers also complain that the decision is a back-door method of allowing companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest banking company, to circumvent state laws that protect their banks from out-of-state takeovers. `` This is going to substantially broaden interstate banking. We believe that should be a state decision, not a federal decision,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, however, says only four states _ <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> _ ban interstate banking. `` It does have the tendency to accelerate the pace of interstate banking,'' said board member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaWare </PERSON>. `` But I think that is happening in any case.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which had pushed for the change, welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> ruling but quarreled with a provision that will prevent bank holding companies from acquiring thrift subsidiaries that sell insurance or invest in real estate. Those are areas prohibited to banks, but not S & amp; L subsidiaries. `` There's nothing in here that alters in any way the separation of commercial activity and industrial activity from banking,'' said board member <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>. In related action earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> lifted so-called `` tandem operating restrictions,'' which had prevented <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> from fully integrating <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls they owned in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> into their banking operations.

 Three days ago, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> stood before 150 reporters, squinted into the glare of television lights, and said he'd been wrong. He pointed to a picture from Voyager 2 of one of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s partial rings, or ring arcs `` It seemed reasonable that this was the lost arc that our imaging team raiders were looking for,'' he said. Reporters had already said so in their stories and broadcasts. But the arc that had disappeared from some earlier pictures and been rediscovered was n't an arc at all. `` It goes all the way around,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Reporters rushed to correct their stories to say that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s first ring had been found `` Now you're going to turn on me, right?'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. He was suffering the perils of what scientists at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory call `` instant science.'' `` We have to think on our feet,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We see things in the images and we try to tell you what we think we see. When the images get better, we have to go even faster.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s job is complicated by the swift delivery of information to the press. Monitors in the press room at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory show reporters raw images from the spacecraft at the same time the scientists see them. When interesting features appear on the television monitors, reporters want interpretations right away. Sometimes the scientists themselves, busy with countless mission-related chores, have n't seen the latest images. Often they have n't had time to decide what the images show. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s unhappy experience with the ring occurred at a Tuesday morning news briefing. Much the same thing happened to Voyager scientists again Thursday, when they stumbled over reports that the spacecraft was about to enter <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, deputy mission manager, told reporters early in the day that the spacecraft had crossed a supersonic shock wave surrounding <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field and was about to enter the field itself. In fact, the spacecraft crossed the shock wave once, then the shock wave moved, and the spacecraft crossed it again, <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. Two hours later, scientists reported that the shock wave had not been crossed. Not until afternoon did <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>'s magnetic field team pop champagne corks and report that the shock wave had definitely been crossed. `` It's not the fault of the media,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We understand there's a lot of public interest. The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people paid for this and they want to know what they're getting for their buck.'' The first solid analysis of the Voyager data will not appear until sometime in January when the so-called 30-day report of the mission is published in a scientific journal. The name comes from a time when missions were simple enough that it was possible to analyze all the data in 30 days, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Even that report, coming five months or so after the mission, will not be final, he said. Voyager science teams will work for another year to process most of the remaining data. Other scientists will then take that data and continue for many years to come, hoping to extract even more information. Voyager passed <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, and `` people are still publishing results from Jupiter.''

<HEAD>Demery Approved HUD Subsidies for Boston Project after Recusing Himself</HEAD>

 Newly released documents show that a top <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration removed himself from dealing with a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> housing project in 1988 but approved a $ 51 million federal subsidy for it two months later. `` Please let this memorandum serve as a formal notification of my recusal in all matters arising from and pertaining to'' developer <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, who was Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary for housing, said in July 1988 memo about the Castle Square project in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s South End. However, <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> signed a Sept. 30, 1988, memo announcing a $ 51.2 million grant to the project. The recusal memo was among <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s files, which were opened to the media Thursday in response to a Freedom of Information request. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, now a private consultant, is under scrutiny in the probe of alleged fraud, abuse and mismanagement at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s files also revealed that he was lobbying in late 1988 to be named <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary, even while he was under investigation by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> developer who owns the <ORGANIZATION> Bostonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, was under contract in 1988 to buy Castle Square from <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON>. Both men contributed to <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s pet charity, F.O.O.D. for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, with <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> holding a fund-raiser at his hotel, according to an internal <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigation released earlier this year. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general concluded that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> may have misused his position to induce contractors seeking HUD-subsidized business to contribute to the charity, but the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said last month that it saw no evidence of criminal wrongdoing. In the memo released Thursday, <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> wrote to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Under Secretary <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Covitz </PERSON>: `` The circumstances leading up to this decision to recuse myself are nebulous at best; I think I would rather err on the side of conservative safety, lest any appearance problem unnecessarily occur.'' <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Thursday. A woman answering his phone said he was on vacation. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> was traveling on business, and <PERSON> Drucker </PERSON> had gone for the day and could not be reached, their offices said Thursday. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> is a former <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> real estate agent and mortgage broker who worked in <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 presidential campaign. As assistant housing secretary, he administered several of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest programs, including $ 225 million in moderate-rehabilitation funds awarded annually and the massive <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s mortgage insurance program The rehabilitation program has been revealed to be governed by influence-peddling while the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> has been losing millions of dollars annually through loan defaults and mismanagement. In his campaign to be named <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> sent a Dec. 7 form letter to several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition official asking for their support and seeking meetings to discuss his qualifications. The position went to former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Halts $1 Billion Government Contract for Nuclear Dump</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge says the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must award a $ 1 billion contract for a high-level nuclear waste dump in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to a company that sued the agency on the grounds the selection process was improper. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Claims Court Judge <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, in a ruling that has set back the government's problem-ridden nuclear waste program, said Thursday that the department could give the 10-year contract only to <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an unsuccessful bidder that filed the December lawsuit. The department said it was disappointed about the ruling, but stressed that the decision did not stop preliminary work to determine the site's suitability. The project has been beset with delays and political squabbles, stemming in part from <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s objection to being chosen as the site for the waste dump, scheduled to begin receiving radioactive cargo in 2003. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, press secretary for <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said the court ruling `` severely weakens the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s credibility'' and underscores the state's contention that the project has been guided by politics, not science. The proposed site at <LOCATION> Yucca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> is about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Construction has not begun, and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has been pressing to begin geologic studies to determine whether the site would qualify. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' chief aide on waste issues, said last month that the department `` ca n't afford'' to start from scratch in soliciting bids for the contract. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s opinion was not immediately made public, but the gist of the decision, without explanation, was contained in a brief memorandum to the parties in the suit. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said the opinion would be kept secret until Wednesday to allow the companies involved to review the document for proprietary information or trade secrets that should not be made public. At issue is a charge by Cleveland-based <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials involved in selecting <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1988 were guilty of a conflict of interest. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>'s contention centered on the fact that <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON>, who had a hand in selecting <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>, had worked for <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subcontractor to <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> is director of the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s office of civilian radioactive waste management, which runs the project. Under federal law, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> supervisors ca n't participate in any projects that involve any energy concern for which they worked for up to one year after leaving that company. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Ginger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rousso </PERSON> was not available for comment Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Laubscher </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that company officials were `` very disappointed'' in the ruling, but had n't seen the opinion or conferred with the DOE. `` We have to do those things before we can speak knowledgeably on the matter,'' <PERSON> Laubscher </PERSON> said. Spokesmen at <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, offices were not available for comment.

<HEAD>FDA Gave Some Generic Drug Companies Preferential Treatment: Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is considering changes in how it handles generic drug applications as the result of a report that said some companies got preferential treatment. The report, issued by the inspector general of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, `` confirms that there are serious weaknesses in <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug review process,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee investigating the generic drug industry. `` The problems are not isolated, as some in the agency originally contended,'' <PERSON> Bliley </PERSON> said. `` The report indicates that the approval process itself needs to be changed. We will pursue corrective legislation on a bipartisan basis at the conclusion of the subcommittee's investigation.'' Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., requested the report, which found that `` weaknesses in the internal control structure of this assignment process allowed preferential treatment to drug firms. Dr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, commissioner of food and drugs, said that agency was evaluating the recommendations and `` will implement the changes as appropriate.'' Thursday's report said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> `` has taken or planned a number of corrective actions.'' The agency has been under fire since it was revealed that some generic drugs were not properly tested before being allowed on the market. Among other things, the report said, the procedures allow a branch chief to favor a particular company by assigning that company's applications to chemists who work rapidly, while penalizing other companies by assigning their applications to slow reviewers. HHS Inspector General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kusserow </PERSON> said his investigation found three cases in which the same drug from competing companies had been assigned to the same chemist for review, making it possible for the chemist to `` deliberately identify fewer deficiencies in one application while identifying numerous deficiencies in a competitor's application.'' The report also said the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> had established few standard procedures for chemists to use, a situation it said `` may indirectly favor one company's application for which a chemist may do a minimal review and adversely affect another company's application for which a chemist may do an exhaustive review.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> lacks a quality control system that assures the fundamental integrity and fairness of the ... review process,'' the report said. The report recommended that policies for random assignment of applications be developed and that there be `` other appropriate methods for reducing the opportunity to show any partiality to applicants.''

<HEAD>Pierce Defends His Performance As HUD Chief</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> denied allegations of favoritism at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and accused critics of misrepresenting his performance, according to a newspaper interview. `` Everybody was treated the same,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in an interview published in Friday's editions. `` That was the advice and the word that I gave to the people at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' The interview marked <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s first public comments about the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> furor since he testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> May 25. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> contradicted that testimony in asserting in the interview that he was a hands-on manager. He said, however, that he did not know of the extensive influence allegedly exercised by his former executive assistant, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said his efforts to help former law partners did not breach his pledge to sever his ties from the firm because he received no financial benefit from the favors and had no agreement to return to the firm. Testimony by former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials and documents has portrayed the agency under <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who served throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, as plagued by mismanagement and influence peddling. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> would not discuss some subjects, the Times reported. He noted that he is scheduled to testify again Sept. 15 and has a deal with a magazine he would not identify to publish his complete story next month. But <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> strongly rejected allegations that high-powered Republicans were given preferential treatment by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, saying that funding for projects was based on the merits. `` You would look at their project and, if was a worthy project, they would be treated favorably. If not they would lose it,'' he said. `` That was the basic approach to all of these. It was n't an approach that, if they are a Republican, you have got to add 10 points or give them something extra.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he believes some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are attacking his operation of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and misrepresenting his performance because these lawmakers' traditional role in lobbying for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants was taken over in part by consultants. Developers have testified that they paid large amounts of money to consultants because the developers thought that doing so was essential to winning <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> action in the Pierce years.

<HEAD>Major Cabinet Member Quits in New Japanese Sex Scandal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 2nd graf `The resignation...' to UPDATE

<TEXT>
 A major Cabinet member at the center of a sex scandal resigned Friday, shaking a 2-week-old administration that has pledged to clean up <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s seamy politics. The resignation of Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Tokuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>, the main government spokesman and top lieutenant to Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, came one month after former Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, plagued by allegations of extramarital affairs, announced he was stepping down. <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, was chosen to replace <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>, an official at the prime minister's office said, speaking anonymously. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, 61, will be the first woman to hold that post. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> is serving her second term in the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and was first elected in 1980. The environment portfolio was her first Cabinet post. On Thursday, <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> acknowledged his liaison with a bar hostess. The acknowledgement came the same day the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Shukan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shincho </ORGANIZATION> published a story describing the relationship that began in 1984, when the woman was 21, and lasted more than three years. `` The <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> administration had placed cleaning up politics at the head of its agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the people ... but in the end I have decided that I must resign,'' he said at a televised press conference late Friday morning. `` I must offer my deepest apologies,'' he said. He added that he had apologized to his wife and that she had forgiven him. <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>, 69, and his wife, <PERSON> Kyoko </PERSON>, have been married 45 years and have four grown daughters. Earlier Friday, he met with <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> at the prime minister's official residence, and later attended a regular weekly gathering of Cabinet ministers `` The task of the <ORGANIZATION> Kaifu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> is to promote clean government, and as I must follow that and support the prime minister ... I can offer only my deepest apologies to the people of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> told a televised news conference Thursday. <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> was appointed two weeks ago, when <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> formed a government after Uno quit because of an election defeat that cost the Liberal Democrats their majority in the upper house of Parliament. Uno was in office only two months, hounded by allegations that he had kept paid mistresses. <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, the man <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> succeeded, resigned to accept responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> influence-buying scandal, which reached the top ranks of government, bureaucracy and business. Uno was chosen because it had not touched him. The latest scandal was considered likely to erode public support for the <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> administration, which has said its priority is restoration of political ethics. Japanese society has been tolerant of rich and powerful men having affairs and mistresses, and only recently have such matters been reported. <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> said Thursday: `` That such news would be reported was due completely to my own indiscretion.'' <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> had a reputation as a `` clean'' politician. He was chosen because he belongs to the same party faction as <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and was not identified with the influence-buying scandal, which contributed to the election defeat last month. <PERSON> Yotaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Konaka </PERSON>, a prominent author and social critic, said Thursday: `` The public is not going to tolerate such insensitivity by political leaders. People must doubt if the new government, which appointed such a person to its top post just when political ethics has become a national issue, has any common sense at all.'' Political analyst <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> said the scandal `` is particularly damaging for <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>. ... The public is not going to believe what he says from now on after such a digusting scandal. I am sure many people are already feeling sick and tired of finding out about new scandals of their country's leaders.'' <ORGANIZATION> Shukan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shincho </ORGANIZATION> said in its edition published Thursday that <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> conducted the affair while serving as transport minister and head of the Management and <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. It said he gave the woman 3 million yen -LRB- $ 21,000 -RRB- on Aug. 3, when there was speculation he would get a high post in the new government, and the woman returned it three days later, the magazine said. <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> was quoted as denying he tried to buy silence and saying: `` I did it from my own good intentions after hearing that she's still having problems in her life.'' The woman was not identified.

 It started as a simple visit by a couple of soldiers in combat fatigues with an 8-year-old boy dying of cancer. But by the end of the day, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> had enlisted in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as a special soldier, flown in a helicopter, ridden in a tanklike vehicle called a mobile howitzer and made some new friends in the military. `` It certainly is a dream come true,'' said the boy's father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> `` Kip'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. `` He's a big G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> fan. He was just thrilled to death, just as thrilled as anyone could be with all these things.'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> has undergone surgery twice since November 1986 for a brain tumor, said his mother, <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. She said chemotherapy was stopped last month after the cancer spread to <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>' spine, leaving him in pain and too weak to walk. `` Now he's on constant morphine to keep away the pain,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` And he's lost most of his mobility. There's nothing more the doctors can do for him right now.'' `` He's a loving boy. It would have been nice to have all these things happen when he was able to follow them a little closer,'' his father added. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, clad in a camouflage uniform with a black military police armband and <PERSON> RILEY </PERSON> stitched above his right pocket, nodded weakly when asked if he enjoyed the 10-minute ride Thursday in the howitzer across a hilly field a couple of blocks from his home in northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Unable to speak much above a whisper, the shy boy described the ride as `` loud.'' `` I saw the look on his face and I sent them around the field again,'' said Maj. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pack </PERSON> of the 201st Field Artillery Unit of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> as the howitzer roared up a hill with <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> and his parents inside. `` He loves G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and we wanted to make one of his dreams come true. This is the closest thing we have to it.'' Poor weather conditions delayed <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>' ride in an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> reserve UH-1 helicopter until late afternoon. `` He's just totally wiped out, he's so happy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. `` His doctor called and said she did n't want him to go up but he wanted to do it.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> was sworn in during a special ceremony by Capt. <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Fairmont recruiting office, which organized the event after a family friend suggested a visit from a couple of G.I. Joes might cheer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a secretary at the recruiting office, was n't about to let it stop there `` I said why do n't we try for a helicopter and a tank,'' said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. `` I was n't about to take no for an answer.'' She did n't have to. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> recruiting battalion sent a four-man color guard and a stuffed bear decked out in a camouflage suit. The 201st volunteered its equipment, soldiers and weapons, and Hawn and 1st Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> prepared an enlistment certificate for <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>. `` We have men here today ... who volunteered to come here because they have children,'' said Pack. `` If their kids were going through something like this, they'd want something like this done. `` I'd want it for my son, if he were <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>' age. We definitely say a prayer each night for <PERSON> Chris </PERSON>, and if the good Lord's willing, maybe he'll pull though this.''

<HEAD>Asteroid Passes Within 2.5 Million Miles Of Earth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Earth is in no danger from a mile-wide chunk of space rock that zipped within about 2.5 million miles of the planet. `` It's just a nice close approach which makes it very convenient for astronomers who want to study it,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The asteroid, named 1989 PB, has been moving at many thousands miles per hour within close observation range of the Earth for several days, <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said. The point of closest approach, about 2.5 million miles away, was estimated at about 11 p.m. EDT Thursday. That's a little more than 10 times the average distance of the Moon from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, about 239,000 miles. <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Helin </PERSON>, an astronomer for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, discovered the asteroid Aug. 9 in film studies taken that day on a telescope at the <ORGANIZATION> Palomar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. When first seen, the asteroid was outside the orbit of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and angling inward, toward the sun, she said. `` It will be adjacent, then pass by and then lead the Earth'' over the next few days, she said. <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> said asteroid 1989 PB will arc away from the Earth's orbit, pass around the sun, dipping to a point inside the orbit of <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and then loop back out to just beyond the orbit of <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. It is expected to cross the Earth's orbit again in about 13 months. But, as <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> noted, `` the Earth will not be there then.'' Asteroid 1989 PB is the sixth to make what <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> called a `` close approach'' to the Earth this year, but only one other has been closer. In March, 1989 <ORGANIZATION> FC </ORGANIZATION> passed within 460,000 miles of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Helin </PERSON> said this is believed to be the closest asteroid pass in the records of astronomy, surpassing an asteroid named <ORGANIZATION> Hermes </ORGANIZATION> that whizzed by 480,000 miles from the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in 1937. Other close approaches, and their distances from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> this year, according to <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON>: 1989 DA in February, 6 million miles; 1989 JA in June, 8 million miles; 1989 AC in January, 10 million miles; and 1989 FB in early February, 20 million to 30 million miles. <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said the cluster of close approaches is just `` a statistical fluke'' and implies nothing about future asteroids. But eventually, he said, one of the rapidly moving space mountains will smash into the Earth. `` If we are talking about a period of within a million years, one almost certainly will hit the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' he said. The chances of a smaller asteroid hitting the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is likely `` within a 1,000 years or so,'' he said, noting that one about 100 yards across exploded just over the <LOCATION> Siberian </LOCATION> plains near <LOCATION> Tunguska </LOCATION> in 1908. The sound could be heard for hundreds of miles and the landscape was blasted as if by a small atomic bomb. <PERSON> Marsden </PERSON> said an object hit <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> about 25,000 years ago, creating a well-known crater near <LOCATION> Flagstaff </LOCATION> more than a mile across. A theory supported by many scientists is that an asteroid that hit the Earth 67 million years ago caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, perhaps by causing a rapid change in the weather.

<HEAD>Center Says Commerce Guarding Turtle Findings Like Espionage Matter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A conservation group alleges that the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is squelching important biological findings as it prepares new regulations to protect endangered sea turtles from drowning in shrimpers' nets. `` Conservation of endangered species is not a matter of Soviet intrigue and espionage,'' <PERSON> Marydele </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnelly </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Caught between the opposing demands of shrimpers and environmentalists, the agency has until Sept. 8 to draft final regulations to hold down mortality rates among five endangered species of sea turtles. The conservation group says it has been unable to obtain biological opinions from <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientists on the most effective way of preventing sea turtle deaths. `` I do n't know of any attempt to suppress any scientific findings, any legal opinions, or any counsel from anyone within the department on this issue,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorman </PERSON>. At issue is whether shrimpers must be required to equip their nets with devices that allow turtles to escape, the method backed by environmentalists, or whether they should restrict their tow times and check their nets before the submerged turtles drown, the choice of many Gulf Coast shrimpers. Under temporary regulations, shrimpers are being required to pull their nets every 105 minutes or use the turtle excluder devices, TEDs.

<NOTE>Minorities Seen Gaining in House From 1990s Redistricting</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A demographic expert says minorities stand a good chance of gaining seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after congressional district lines are redrawn based on results of the 1990 Census. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, director of policy studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, also predicted that `` there is going to be a mountain of litigation'' over issues such as adjustments for undercounted minorities, whether to exclude illegal aliens and inclusion of military personnel overseas in the count used for reapportionment. In the 1991-92 reapportionment, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said, `` the states that are likely to gain the most congressional seats _ for example, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ all have large minority populations.'' He said the country's Hispanic population was expected to show a particularly strong gain, from about 14.5 million in 1980 up to a projected 22 million in the 1990 Census _ with most of the increase concentrated in Sunbelt states. Asked what net gain of minority members he expects there will be in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said: `` Certainly half a dozen to 10 is not unreasonable. ... I would say that's optimistic, but not outlandishly optimistic.'' The 435-seat <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has 36 minority members _ 22 blacks, nine Hispanics, four Asian-Americans and one American Indian. Blacks make up about 12 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population but have only 1.5 percent of elected officials, while Hispanics comprise 8 percent of the population but are less than 2 percent of elected officials, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Population </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> describes itself as a private, non-partisan organization that tries to increase public awareness and understanding of population issues.

 A majority of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers voted for Solidarity's <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister, embracing the former adversary for his integrity and expressing hope that he can help save a country in crisis. `` I accepted his election with the full conviction that the government has an excellent helmsman who will steer this boat to hope and not lead it into the shallows,'' lawmaker <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiszbach </PERSON>, a deputy Sejm speaker from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said after the vote Thursday. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> received at least 91 of the votes from the 173-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> caucus, whose deputies were allowed to vote as they wished in a departure from traditional party discipline. The vote in the Sejm, or lower house of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, was 378-4 with 41 abstentions. Thirty-seven deputies did not appear for the vote. `` There's a lot of them, a lot!'' exclaimed Solidarity journalist <PERSON> Ewa </PERSON> <PERSON> Milewicz </PERSON>, peering from a balcony as she tried to count the Communist votes in the Sejm. <PERSON> Fiszbach </PERSON>, who sat across the table from <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to negotiate accords that led to legalization of Solidarity in August 1980, remembered the new prime minister `` as an honest, noble man with high values, an excellent negotiator and politician.'' <PERSON> Fiszbach </PERSON> later was stripped of his post as party chief in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and his Politburo seat because of his sympathy for Solidarity. Army Col. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosinski </PERSON>, another Communist deputy, also supported Solidarity's choice for prime minister. `` I voted for <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> because the other Polish political situation was worse. I know there is now hope that our system can improve itself,'' he said. `` Things will be hard. The job of the prime minister will be to obtain credibility,'' he said. `` Poles must believe in something and he -LRB- <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> -RRB- is the one who has the best chances.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, or Soviet Cabinet, sent a telegram congratulating <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and expressed `` the certainty that the traditional relations of friendship and all-around cooperation between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will continue.'' An interview with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> also was printed Thursday in the Soviet government's evening newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. The new Polish leader was quoted as saying his government would be open to all, including the Polish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but that the time was clearly past `` when only one camp could form the government.'' Solidarity has promised the Communists the strategic ministries of defense and interior, which control the army and the police. `` I am convinced that the party will be represented in the government and will cooperate. It is a new stage of democracy,'' said <PERSON> Fiszbach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> on Wednesday indicated that he would find additional spots in the Cabinet for the Communists. For the first time in 45 years, the party will not lead the government and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> deputies say it is time for their movement to develop new directions. `` The party now has a chance to form a new program ... Without being on the front line,'' said <PERSON> Kosinski </PERSON>. In line with the change, a group of 15 deputies on Thursday submitted a proposal to drop from the constitution the clause that mandates that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> be `` the leading political force.''

<HEAD>Colombians Overcome Fear Of Drug Traffickers And Fight Back</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The assassination of a promising young presidential hopeful has triggered a backlash against drug kingpins by Colombians who have overcome their fear and are helping authorities fight back. `` We've had a tremendous cooperation from the people,'' the national police force's press chief, Col. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>, said in an interview Thursday. `` The people have always wanted to cooperate with the police, but they were afraid,'' he said. `` They've left aside their fear and are cooperating.'' When five suspects in the slaying of Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> were paraded before 15 witnesses this week, the witnesses did not hesitate in fingering four of them, police said. They also said special hot lines set up to receive tips are providing information that has enabled police to raid several of the hundreds of drug lords' estates and businesses as part of the crackdown. <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> said the cooperation was inspired by citizens witnessing police, for the first time, engaged in a virtual all-out war with the country's drug cartels. The crackdown was sparked by the assassinations of <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a police colonel and a magistrate in a 48-hour period last week. <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, 46, was a highly popular <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president and the widely acknowleged leader of a new political generation. He was considered extremely honest and spoke vehemently about the need to eradicate the drug underworld. An assassin pumped five bullets into his lower abdomen, beneath his bullet-proof vest, as he stood on a small platform during a political rally on <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s outskirts Friday night. Several accomplices in the killing raked the air with gunfire to provoke panic and allow the trigger-man's escape. Traffickers previously had been blamed for the assassinations of a justice minister and an attorney general, but <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s slaying took drug-sponsored violence to a new level, Colombians contend. <PERSON> Clara </PERSON> <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> city council member in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, said his murder showed the traffickers `` are attacking the core of the country's institutions and want to replace the current political leadership.'' The witnesses' decision to identify the killers was `` a demonstration of the deep indignation of the people,'' she said in an interview at her home. `` The indignation is so strong that it's not leaving room for fear,'' she said. Fear is real and justified in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. As Mrs. <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> recalled, traffickers two years ago killed a 9-year-old girl who had witnessed the assassination of a leftist political leader in the town of <LOCATION> Barrancabermeja </LOCATION>. Another witness survived for two years before being gunned down a few months ago. Since 1981, 220 judges, magistrates and judicial aides have been killed in the traffickers' campaign of terror against the legal system. Each important assassination has appeared to galvanize Colombian society, but only temporarily. Previous crackdowns, although not as intense as the current offensive, have petered out in a few weeks. On Thursday, the traffickers declared `` absolute war'' in response to the police and military actions and to the prospect of extradition should they be arrested. They counterattacked with bombings and arson in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the home of the world's biggest cocaine cartel. Mrs. <PERSON> Obregon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said it was evident `` they are trying to reinstill fear and dampen spirits, to cut short this anti-narcotics campaign.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government must show its resolve by following through on a promise to extradite any drug lords who are arrested. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Colombian authorities say they are trying to arrange the extradition of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, a suspected finance manager for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel caught on Saturday. Two other possible subjects for extradition, also described as important trafficking figures, were arrested Wednesday. But the reputed cartel bosses have yet to be captured. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON>, an editor of the respected <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION>, said in a commentary Thursday that the latest killings represent `` the most inconceivable challenge that the traffickers could have sent to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> state, so arrogant and brutal as to appear delirious.'' He called on the government of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to take even stronger action to destroy the cartels and capture their leaders. `` Has the hour finally arrived -LRB- when we say -RRB- ` Enough already?' ... We'll know soon,'' <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> said.

 Researchers gazed at stark images of rips and tears in the white carcass of the <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, but those pictures brought them no closer to answering why the famed ship sank. `` Boy, it's awe inspiring to see. But none of it is surprising,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, a Canadian archaeologist on board the research vessel Grayling that floated above the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> wreckage again Thursday. Researchers used a small, submersible robot to obtain the first clear footage of the sunken boat. The expedition is being filmed for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s Explorer television series. The 729-foot steel freighter was carrying 27,000 tons of iron ore down <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> when it sank in a gale Nov. 10, 1975. All 29 crew members died. The tragedy became legend within a year, when Canadian balladeer <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lightfoot </PERSON> sang of the crew, `` All that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and the sons and the daughters.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and other researchers aboard the Grayling marveled at video images showing the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>'s crumpled pilothouse and severed hull. Portholes were blown out and half-inch thick steel was crinkled like tinfoil, while the ship's bell and water cooler remained untouched. `` I was surprised by the visibility. I was surprised that the bell was sitting on top. It's just unreal,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnquist </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipwreck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Whitefish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> and one of three expedition leaders. The official <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> report said the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> sank after taking on water through its hatches as it plowed through 30-foot waves. Others believe the storm dropped the ship onto a shoal, punching a hole in its hull. In either case, the boat sank so quickly there was never a distress call. The captain's last words were that his ship was holding its own in the storm. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he did n't see any evidence that lent weight to either theory. A 2 - to 4-foot rip in the front of the <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>'s hull puzzled researchers somewhat <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> theorized the damage occurred when the boat struck the bottom of the lake. `` At the speed she was going, when she hit the bottom, boom,'' he said, shoving his fist into his hand to illustrate an impact that would have cracked open the freighter. `` I just find that terribly inexplicable,'' said author <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stonehouse </PERSON>, also on board the Grayling. `` It's almost like you cracked an eggshell. In this case, its half-inch steel.'' An answer to why the modern freighter sank would be nice, but expedition leaders are more interested in testing the submersible robot and its three-dimensional camera system for use on other shipwrecks.

 The newly consolidated Lutheran church's interim policy against ordaining practicing homosexuals prompted a clergywoman to comment, `` So this is the policy we will have about it while we are trying to develop a policy about it. The remark by the Rev. <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, indicates the somewhat misty hiatus in which the church finds itself on various social issues. In keeping with Lutheranism's characteristic analytical approach, the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first decision-making assembly called for more study before taking definite stands on several sensitive questions, including sexuality. Of that subject's myriad aspects, the Rev. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, executive director of the church's social-concerns commission, said, `` It's a very difficult issue that we must study carefully, prayerfully and thoroughly so that we can discern the path which God is calling us to follow.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is the result of the Jan. 1, 1988 merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. The 5.3-million-member denomination ordered studies on a batch of issues, including the homeless, family life, capital punishment and health care. Action was pending on a proposal for a two-year study of sexuality, including homosexuality and abortion, but a women's caucus was pressing for immediate action on abortion `` It's a stopgap until the study is done,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lindsborg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. It was proposed as necessary because of the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision allowing some state regulation of abortion. Sidestepping numerous proposals by different congregations and regional synods for definite stands on various social issues, the assembly referred most of them for study. Responding briefly on a grass-roots proposal, the assembly did condemn racism as a sin and urged Lutherans to stay alert to the `` destructive results of racism.'' Also, the church affirmed commitment to a `` just and equitable welfare system'' and encouraged `` those engaged in the task of welfare reform.'' The assembly asked for study of gun control by Lutherans, a church commission and by government to `` explore options for better management of these weapons through an outright ban or regulation of lawful sales.'' On health care, the assembly declared it supported `` high quality health care for everyone,'' and advocated legislation to achieve that goal, but authorized studies to develop a policy on the matter. The 1,050 voting delegates still had before them some proposed actions on divestment from companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and on membership in major ecumenical councils. The eight-day assembly began Wednesday. Noting that many issues were being delayed for studies prior to action at the second biennial assembly in 1991, the church's president, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said, `` This means that our 1991 assembly should be a lively one.

Those four, along with <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, were also indicted on drug trafficking charges in 1986 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. All are at-large. About 80 alleged Colombian drug traffickers have been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but their cases have languished since the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned its extradition treaty with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987. Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, prompted by last week's assassination of presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, instituted emergency measures to allow the immediate resumption of extraditions The extradition treaty was overturned shortly after the extradition of former cartel leader <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> in 1987. He was tried in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, convicted of operating a continuing criminal enterprise, and is now in federal prison serving a life sentence without parole. Cartel leaders Thursday declared war on the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government just as bombs blew up offices of two principal political parties in the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, which serves as a base for the world's biggest cocaine cartel. At the time of the March indictment, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Genzman </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> was responsible for the April 1983 assassination of Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonilla </PERSON>. After the killing, according to the indictment, cartel members including <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the cartel brought in 1,400 kilograms of cocaine to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brasiles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the cocaine was flown into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One of the flights resulted in the seizure of 665 kilograms of cocaine by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. A second cocaine flight was made by <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s pilots from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Andros </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and eventually into <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. If convicted of the <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> indictment, which lists 205 separate acts beginning in 1974 and continuing until this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Ochoas </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Rodriquez </PERSON> would face mandatory life prison terms. Prosecutors said the indictment involves the importation of 44,000 pounds of cocaine worth $ 1 billion. In all, 30 people were named in the indictment. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> was convicted of creating a small, private air force and then using the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>'s Cay as a way station for shipments for more than 20 tons of cocaine into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. The <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> indictment, which alleges smuggling activities of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel from 1978 to 1986, claims the practices used by the cartel included `` the corruption of the public officials of foreign govenments, the use of force, violence, threats, physical assaults and murders of informants, discordant employees, and cartel opponents.''

 A pilot was cleared of criminal complicity in a July 1988 helicopter escape from the state penitentiary, and he said he is bitter over what he considers persecution by law enforcement agencies. Following an eight-day trial, a jury deliberated fewer than three hours Thursday before acquitting <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> of conspiracy and three counts of assisting a prison escape, all felonies. The <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, pilot said afterward he's $ 500,000 in debt because of the trial and damage to his helicopter. Justice triumphed, but he is considering suing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, he added. `` I'm going to try to get a little bit more justice in this state,'' <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> had testified that he was hijacked July 11, 1988, by <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON>, a girlfriend of inmate <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, and forced at gunpoint to land in the prison recreation yard to pick up three inmates. He then flew to <LOCATION> Mid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where the escapees and Ms. <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> fled from the helicopter, leaving <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> handcuffed to a control stick. He said inmate <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> returned to the helicopter, stuck a pistol to his head and ordered him to take off. That's when a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Customs officer fired at the <ORGANIZATION> Gazelle </ORGANIZATION> helicopter and hit a landing skid. `` They are either going to try to kill you from the outside or persecute you on the inside,'' <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> said he's working on a book because `` there is a lot to be learned from this experience. Things were done to me that should n't have been done. District Attorney <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> said: `` Of course we regret but accept the jury's verdict. We do regret that the jury did not have at its disposal in making its decision all the evidence that the prosecution had at its disposal.'' The judge excluded all hearsay statements by inmate <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON>. The state alleged that <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> conspired with <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> and that he received $ 30,000. <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> testified that he was contacted on the weekend prior to the escape by a man identifying himself as <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Allen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, who hired him for an aerial real estate survey. He said he was hijacked shortly after picking up Ms. <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and forced at gunpoint to land in the penitentiary recreation yard to pick up the inmates. Ms. <PERSON> Shoemaker </PERSON>, who also was charged with conspiracy and three counts of assisting a prison escape, pleaded guilty last week and testified for the defense. Her account mainly matched <PERSON> Bella </PERSON>'s and contradicted <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON>'s. The three inmates were charged with conspiracy and prison escape. <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> was tried and convicted in April. <PERSON> Lackey </PERSON> pleaded guilty in April to a single charge of prison escape and was sentenced to a 10-year prison term with seven years suspended. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s trial is pending. Former state Attorney General <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Norvell </PERSON>, who teamed with <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> in defense of <LOCATION> Bella </LOCATION>, said the fairly brief deliberation `` shows the decision was swift and dispositive and consistent with what we thought should have been the disposition all along.''

<HEAD>Government and Traffickers Trade Salvos As Cocaine War Heats Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government intensified its war on drugs, ordering cocaine traffickers to surface and claim $ 200 million in confiscated property or lose it. Enraged dealers staged a series of deadly bomb and arson attacks. Using emergency powers under a four-year state of siege, President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> issued a decree Thursday requiring owners of the seized property personally to make claims for restitution and barring them from using real estate agents, lawyers or other fronts. Police and military agents have seized hundreds of luxurious mansions, ranches, office buildings, shops and restaurants across the country along with airplanes, helicopters, cars, trucks and other items in an unprecedented offensive. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials put the total value of the goods at about $ 200 million. The government crackdown began last week after the assassinations of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a popular presidential hopeful, as well as a national police colonel and a magistrate. Drug traffickers were blamed. Many of the drug lords face charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government promised to extradite any who are arrested. Early Thursday, traffickers infuriated by the crackdown bombed offices of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> and Conservative party offices in downtown <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, killing a passerby. They also set fire to the weekend retreats of two prominent politicians on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, an industrial city 215 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and the base for the world's biggest cocaine cartel. Families were sleeping in both houses when gangs doused the structures with gasoline before dawn and set them ablaze, authorities said. The families ran outside and were not hurt. Two bombs, each containing about 45 pounds of dynamite, were found at the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> offices of two national radio networks and deactivated. At one of the stations the bombers left a communique saying: `` We declare total and absolute war on the government, on the industrial and political oligarchy, on the journalists who have attacked and ravaged us, on the judges who have sold out to the government, on the extraditing magistrates, on the labor union presidents and all those who have persecuted and attacked us.'' The communique was signed by The Extraditables, a violent group authorities link to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. `` We will not respect the families of those who have not respected our families,'' it said. `` We will burn and destroy the industries, the properties and the mansions of the oligarchy.'' Authorities have arrested three alleged drug traffickers as part of the crackdown, but the bosses of the cocaine cartels are believed in hiding. According to one of <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s decrees, property that is not claimed by the owners will be divided among government agencies. Rural property will be distributed among landless peasants, and urban property will go to needy children and mothers, according to the decree. People are tipping police to possible raid sites, said a national police spokesman, Col. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON>. `` The people have always wanted to cooperate with the police, but they were afraid,'' he said. `` They've left aside their fear and are cooperating.'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> said seized cash, automobiles and trucks will be used to improve judges' working conditions, and air and sea craft will go to the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the air force's commercial transport business. The president also ordered an inventory of all <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s private airstrips. Those whose legitimate use can not be proved will be destroyed under the presumption they are used for drug smuggling. Another presidential decree allows secret votes to ensure the anonymity of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> magistrates required to rule on the constitutionality of decrees issued in the anti-narcotics campaign. Court officers are a constant target of assassination and other acts of terror by traffickers. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics expert in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> said two of the suspected drug dealers arrested by Colombian police in the crackdown are wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on smuggling-related charges: <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatriz </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. A third suspect, <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Londono </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, has the same name as a man wanted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but authorities could not confirm his identity, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expert said on condition of anonymity. He said he expects <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities to supply the papers for <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s extradition before Colombian authorities are obliged to release him. Police are empowered to hold suspects without charging them for seven working days. Politicians say <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s latest wave of drug-related violence jeopardizes the country's electoral process for the first time in more than 30 years. Elections are planned next March for a new congress and new mayors. Campaigning already is under way for the May presidential election.

 Politicians say the latest wave of drug-sponsored violence, including the slaying of a presidential candidate, threatens the country's electoral process. In March, Colombians are to choose a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and mayors. In May, a presidential vote is planned, and campaigning is already under way. But according to ex-president <PERSON> Misael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> <PERSON> Borrero </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, `` the electoral process is badly compromised,'' both by cocaine traffickers and leftist guerrillas. `` There are at least 50 municipalities in which it is impossible to conduct political campaigning,'' he said in a local radio interview. `` Under these conditions the electoral process is wounded.'' Those municipalities are effectively controlled by leftist guerrilla organizations or hit squads funded by narcotics traffickers allied with right-wing extremists. The death squads are blamed for countless slayings of leftist and labor activists and also conduct what is euphemistically called `` social cleansing'' _ the killing of vagabonds, prostitutes, the elderly and infirm. Several leftist guerrilla groups are active in the country. They control many rural areas, attack military and economic targets _ including oil pipelines _ and kidnap for ransom. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Samper </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizano </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> senator and presidential candidate, complained that `` there are no guarantees -LRB- of safety -RRB- for the electoral campaign.'' He said he feared that `` the process might be jeopardized by new and unfortunate acts of violence.'' Last Friday, assassins believed hired by cocaine traffickers killed the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leading presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>. His death capped a 48-hour wave of drug-sponsored slayings that included a police chief and a magistrate. <PERSON> Samper </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizano </PERSON> said candidates will change their campaign strategy to focus more on television spots and cut the number of potentially dangerous public appearances. Political campaigning was suspended indefinitely after <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>'s slaying The new violence comes as democracy is broadening its base. Mayors used to be appointed, and were elected for the first time only last year. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> has endured constant political bloodshed throughout the 1900s, including a bloody rural war between the Liberals and the Conservatives between 1948 and 1958. The only interruption in the democratic process was between 1953 and 1957, when a military government ruled.

<HEAD>Olympic Council Head Says Asia Games in China Will go as Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Next year's Asian Games in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> will be the first held under martial law if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not lift the security measure, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia </ORGANIZATION> said today. But Sheikh Fahad <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> told reporters after an eight-day inspection tour of the Asian Games facilities that he was confident <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> could open the games as planned on Sept. 22, 1990. There has been much speculation about whether martial law, instituted in late May during the popular democracy movement, would be lifted before the 11th Asian Games. Martial law troops armed with assault rifles still are stationed at major intersections and bridges throughout the capital. `` If there is martial law or any other security system, it does n't concern the <ORGANIZATION> OCA </ORGANIZATION>,'' the sheikh said. <PERSON> Fahad </PERSON> did not say if Chinese officials had told him whether martial law would end before the games. He also did not say if any of the Olympic Committee's 38 member countries in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> planned to boycott the games. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents have urged a boycott to protest the June crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in which hundreds, perhaps thousands, were killed. <PERSON> Fahad </PERSON> said he was satisifed with the progress the Chinese have made in preparing for the games, which will include 27 events. Between 6,500 and 7,000 athletes and officials are expected to attend. In addition, 4,000 journalists are expected. `` The <ORGANIZATION> OCA </ORGANIZATION> feels that the percentage of construction already completed is very satisfactory. They have reason to believe that all the construction facilities will be ready ahead of time,'' the Olympic Committee delegation said in a news release. Reporters touring the main games complex in northern <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> earlier this week could see that much work remained to be done. A future press center and two planned hotels were mere shells, and the swimming stadium and warm-up gym had roofs but no walls. Construction of 16 stadiums and renovation of 11 existing facilities slowed to a virtual crawl last winter because of a shortage of building materials and theft. Work was interrupted this spring by the student-led democracy movement, which hampered delivery of supplies. Workers were lured off the job to watch or participate. Asked what he thought was the biggest problem, <PERSON> Fahad </PERSON> said: `` Security is a great problem. Food is a great problem. Transportation is a great problem. Communication is a great problem. Accommodations is a great problem. All these are great problems.'' Chinese officials have acknowledged that funding also is a problem. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhongyuan </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said on Monday that the estimated cost of holding the games has risen to $ 673 million, up from last year's estimate of $ 565 million. To raise money and to drum up enthusiasm for the games, officials have started selling lottery tickets, which ordinarily are illegal. Interest seems to be high, with crowds gathered around tables set up on main streets to buy the tickets, which each go for 1 yuan, or about 27 cents. The top prize is worth $ 270. Red banners throughout the city appeal to residents' patriotism and exhort them to help with Asian Games preparations. Collection boxes have been seen on some streets, and a billboard at a major intersection counts down the number of days left until the opening ceremony.

 Negotiators for <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> and striking members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> here have reached a tentative settlement, but talks elsewhere produced varying results, officials say. Negotiators for the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> local that represents its four subsidiaries announced the agreement after meeting twice on Thursday. `` We look forward to getting everyone back to work,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Plumb </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said none of the 41,000 <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P employees who have been on strike since Aug. 6 would return to work until local issues are settled at all <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries. C & amp; P operates telephone companies in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Local issues in dispute involved such things as work rules and the contracting of work traditionally done by union employees to outside firms. Basic agreement on economic issues throughout the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> system was reached a week ago. The only outstanding local issues remaining among subsidiaries and the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> involved Bell of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, Plumb said. `` We're pleased to have settled issues of job security and work rules with <ORGANIZATION> C </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P Telephone,'' said <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Catucci </PERSON>. `` But we're dismayed by the retrogressive demands still on the table.'' <PERSON> Catucci </PERSON> charged that those companies were `` completely unresponsive'' to the needs of the workers and placed `` major obstacles'' in the path of a settlement. The company wants the union to give back some arbitration decisions, <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON> said. Bell of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> reached agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> rejected <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s final offer late Thursday, Plumb said. The union, which represents 9,100 workers, presented a counter-offer that Plumb said `` leaves the two sides far apart.'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> settled its local issues with the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the week. In <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, contract talks resumed for the first time in the 12-day strike by 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> employees Thursday, with both the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and the company indicating interest in making headway. Meetings were scheduled to continue this afternoon. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday afternoon met for the first time since the strike began, but phone company negotiators walked out in early evening, saying the union was not willing to make key concessions on pay, said company negotiator <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Soliunas </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> officials countered that <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has refused to make concessions as part of the collective bargaining process.

 A woman trying to convince authorities that her ex-husband sexually abused their daughter has been offered help by two people who say they were molested by him years ago. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, 40, fled with her two children after her former husband, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>, was acquitted in November of charges that he sexually assaulted his daughter.

His mother, <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON>, 60, said her son described the alleged sex act to her after he returned home late that day. <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON> said he and his parents put the incident behind them and did n't think of it until a friend of his mother's visiting from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> brought them a newspaper article on the Murabitos' case The case made national news two years ago when Mrs. <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> hid the children and went to jail for a week rather than let them visit their father. He said he decided to come forward because he did n't want the same thing to happen to someone else. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> molested her when she was about 8 years old. `` <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> was the baby sitter one night when the adults were at the chapel,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>. `` I was supposed to be asleep but had been reading a book when I heard <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON> coming up the stairs. `` I put the book down and pretended to be asleep,'' she said. `` He sat on the edge of the bed, pulled the cover down, and pulled my underwear down. Then he sat and stared at my crotch for a while.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said she felt `` very uncomfortable and embarrassed'' afterward. Unlike the Spauldings and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> and his family did not live at the religious community, but went to Green Pastures for church services and functions. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said she kept silent about the incident for 10 years before telling her mother. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said she followed the <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> case in the news and became interested in it when she moved to <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION> briefly last year while <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>'s felonious sexual assault trial was in progress. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said she wanted to testify against <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> at the trial, but <ORGANIZATION> Rockingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> would n't allow it. County Attorney <PERSON> Carleton </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said the judge would not let her take the stand because <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON>'s prior behavior had no bearing on the case. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said he considers <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> credible and believes her story. Mrs. <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON> said she and her husband told church authorities about the incident and that <PERSON> Murabito </PERSON> was n't allowed on the farm for a long time. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pastures </ORGANIZATION>, said he knew nothing about <PERSON> Spaulding </PERSON>'s claims. He said the church officials who ran <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pastures </ORGANIZATION> at the time are dead and the church kept no records that could document the story. `` I never heard anything of it before and would find it hard to believe. He -LRB- Murabito -RRB- is a fine person,'' said <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' trip to <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> to sign a cooperation pact is part of a diplomatic offensive offering agricultural and military help to <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries in return for political support. The effort has been faring well despite Third World criticism of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s battle against the Palestinian uprising in the occupied lands, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> attempts to block <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> inroads in the region. `` Surprisingly, the Palestinian uprising has had little effect on African nations seeking better relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Naomi </PERSON> <PERSON> Chazan </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> expert at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> on Thursday night and was to sign an agreement today with <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> that provides for assistance in water conservation, desert reclamation and soil preservation. Eighty percent of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s land is arid and unsuitable for agriculture. Military analysts say <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> also received shipments of surface-to-surface missiles from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last year. In return for such aid, one highly placed <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source said, African nations are `` expected to show good will and abstain from voting on anti-Israel resolutions in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.'' Thirty African nations broke relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1973 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war in a show of support for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> adversaries. Since then, black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has joined forces with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations in repeatedly censuring <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. But Israeli officials see this situation as turning around. `` In the last seven years, we are slowly but surely regaining our 1973 position in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Meir </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoffe </PERSON>, head of the African desk at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chazan </PERSON> said, however, that this is `` a gradual and incremental process. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will probably not entirely regain its former status.'' Seven countries have resumed full relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in recent years, including <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and most recently, <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has a diplomatic representative in <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> operating through the <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION> never broke ties. The diplomatic thaw is a result of political changes in the region and a decline in Arab aid resulting from dwindling oil revenues. The 1979 Israel-Egypt peace treaty that normalized relations between the former enemies led <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries to feel it was permissible to resume relations, <PERSON> Yoffe </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which for years demanded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> be destroyed, last year accepted the Jewish state's right to exist, giving <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> `` just the opportunity it was waiting for. This gave legitimacy to its action,'' said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity. Israeli sources say African countries often threaten to resume ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as leverage to gain aid from Arab countries. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has much to offer <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Two-thirds desert itself, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has perfected rough-and-ready agricultural techniques suitable to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s arid climate and rugged conditions. `` Our advisers go out into the bush while other advisers stay at their hotels in the capital,'' <PERSON> Yoffe </PERSON> said. A defense data bank in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> reports that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also is providing military hardware and training to <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations. Reports say Zairean President <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobuto </PERSON>'s palace guard is Israeli-trained, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> advisers are reportedly active in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>. Unconfirmed reports speak of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sending advisers and military supplies to <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>, the Cenral <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION>. `` It is in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s interest to keep <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries stable politically,'' a senior Israeli source said on condition of anonymity. Israeli development projects in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> now total $ 400 million, 60 percent of which is in countries that do not have relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, senior government sources said. <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, an African nation with a large Moslem population and no formal ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, is the largest recipient of Israeli technical aid, they said. `` <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> is an important and influential state,'' <PERSON> Chazan </PERSON> said. `` Everyone is watching it and wondering whether it will resume relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Parallel to Israeli advances, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has established a number of offices in African nations. `` The <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries are using this to signal that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs are not mutually exclusive in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Chazan </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Police Grab Flags From Ukraine Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police grabbed national flags away from Ukrainians who marched through the republic's capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> and attacked protesters at a mass meeting, activists said today. Six demonstrators from among about 2,000 were arrested at Wednesday's march and meeting to mark the 50th anniversary of the Soviet-Nazi pact that divided up <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the Baltic states, <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Dotsenko </PERSON> said. Activist <PERSON> Oles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON> said police under orders to take away the aqua-and-yellow <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> flags beat several people `` using their fists and in some cases clubs.'' `` It was a wild and disgusting sight,'' <PERSON> Shevchenko </PERSON>, also of the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> group, said by phone from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. No one was reported seriously injured. <PERSON> Dotsenko </PERSON> said that of the six protesters arrested, three were released and three were required to pay symbolic fines of $ 16. The protesters had official permission to meet in a city stadium but they were warned by police not to raise `` national symbols,'' <PERSON> Dotsenko </PERSON> said. He said they defied the order and held up their flags. They also shouted `` Freedom to the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>'' and slogans denouncing Soviet power and the republic's conservative party chief, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbitsky </PERSON>. Mass meetings with similar slogans were held in the Ukrainian cities of <LOCATION> Lvov </LOCATION>, Ivano-Frankovsk and <LOCATION> Dnepropetrovsk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dotsenko </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, at least 75 protesters were arrested Wednesday night at an illegal rally in <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. In the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, display of national flags is legal and common. Hundreds of thousands of Baltic residents took part Wednesday in a giant human chain and a variety of protests and meetings without any reported clashes with police. Reformist movements in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> lag behind similar groups in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, however. <PERSON> Dotsenko </PERSON> said a founding congress for the <ORGANIZATION> Ukrainian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> would be held in <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> on Sept. 8 to help organize the republic's grass-roots forces.

 The government is trying to halt an alarming decline in palm trees on the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> island state in recent decades, a government official says. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul-Wahab </PERSON> <PERSON> al </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday that in the past 30 to 40 years the number of <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s palm trees has dwindled from about 1 million to a little more than 250,000. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>, a U.S.-educated prince in <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>'s ruling family, blamed the decline on widespread urbanization, the increasing salinity of underground reservoirs and an agricultural trend toward more profitable vegetable growing. His department is studying hybrid fertilization and seeding programs to bolster palm tree growing, he said.

<TEXT>
 Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in an interview published today strongly rejected allegations that his department gave high-powered Republicans preferential treatment. `` Everybody was treated the same,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in his first published interview in three months. `` That was the advice and the word that I gave to the people at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> also said his efforts to help former law partners did not breach his pledge to sever ties to the firm because he received no financial benefit from the favors and had no agreement to return to the firm. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who was in the Cabinet throughout the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, had not commented publicly about the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> influence peddling furor since he testified before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> May 25. He is scheduled to testify again Sept. 15 and said he is looking forward to `` setting the record straight.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, in the interview, would not discuss some subjects, citing his upcoming testimony and a deal with a magazine he did not identify to publish his complete story next month. He would not discuss why he ordered <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 to fund a <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, housing project that was opposed by many staff members but supported by the Republican mayor of <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>. The mayor was a former law colleague of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s and a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign strategist. `` I had what I think, anyway, were good reasons, but I will have to save that for the subcommittee,'' he said. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> insisted funding for projects was based on merits. He said he believes some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> whom he would not identify are attacking him because these lawmakers' traditional role in lobbying for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grants was taken over in part by consultants. Developers have testified that they paid large amounts of money to consultants because they thought doing so was essential to winning <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> action in the Pierce years. `` Some of these congressmen, they are saying, ` Nobody can get you this but us. This is our job, and we do n't want any competition,''' said <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> asserted that he was a hands-on manager, but acknowledged he did not know of the extensive influence allegedly exercised by his former executive assistant, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. In his May testimony, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said that he was not a hands-on manager and that he was not involved in recommending funding for specific projects. But later testimony by other former officials showed that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was directly involved in some projects. `` Of course, I was involved in making decisions and recommendations,'' he said. `` You ca n't be in a job for eight years and not make a decision.'' The congressional inquiry was sparked by allegations that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s moderate rehabilitation program to repair rental housing for the poor and elderly was beset by favoritism Testimony has disclosed that Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, rather than a committee, made many of the decision about which projects were funded. `` I did n't find out until the hearings that it was working that way,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` I had a damn good right to think that it was working right.'' Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> has refused to testify and has asserted through her attorneys that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding decisions were made by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Soviet, American Scientists Urge Joint Action Against Global Warming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Cold War was nothing compared to the worldwide Heat War possible if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet leaders fail to cooperate to halt global warming, scientists said. Climate shifts and a rising sea level could pit rich nations against poor, northern nations against southern, and inland nations against coastal, participants at a U.S.-Soviet conference on global warming said Thursday. A sea-level rise of three feet in the next century would force millions of people to flee the lowlands of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and other Third World nations, creating `` environmental refugees,'' said astronomer <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>. `` Where will those people go? Are there going to be food wars? Or water wars? What happens if the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> becomes scrub desert?'' <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> is one of more than 80 Americans and 11 Soviets participating in a four-day symposium dubbed `` greenhouse glasnost'' by its co-sponsors, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, founded by actor-filmmaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>. `` We have to get past this business of hearing the phrase, ` We need more study,''' <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> said. `` We must act.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the world's biggest producers of carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons, gases that trap solar heat in a process called the greenhouse effect. The superpowers' leadership is needed because developing nations are fast catching up with the superpowers in producing pollutants, <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't tell these Third World countries, ` Please do n't do what we did,''' he said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have to come in with economically feasible alternatives.'' Developing countries have few resources to adapt to major climate shifts, <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said, but even wealthy nations can not stop global warming alone. `` The planet is a unit. No one nation can solve the problem,'' he said. `` We're all in the greenhouse together.'' Soviet scientist <PERSON> Roald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagdeev </PERSON> recalled a warning he recently gave a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> audience: `` I suggested that the issue of environmental survival should be elevated to the level of nuclear survival.'' Conference organizers hope to contact President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to urge concrete steps to reduce global warming. Suggested strategies include: increasing energy efficiency to reduce levels of carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels; slowing the destruction of the world's forests; and planting new trees. Although scientists do disagree, `` they're all in the same ballpark,'' <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said. Various studies predict global temperatures will rise 3 to 10 degrees during the next century. Even the low figure could cause catastrophic climate changes. `` That there is something to worry about _ a concurrence of the oracles _ is very clear,'' <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON> said. But it may not be the lack of knowledge that proves the biggest stumbling block, said Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION> `` Politicians are aware, but politicians are fervently short-sighted,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` They look at the next election and not the next generation.'' If policymakers wait for more conclusive evidence, it will be too late, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleick </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, Environment and Security. `` Even if we were to take drastic actions today, climate changes are already in the works,'' he said. Soviets at the conference include climatologists, a filmmaker and an author. Americans include scientists and business, environmental, and political leaders. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> said the conference invited non-scientists to spread support for the fight against global warming. `` We're here to pass the baton from scientific people, who know what's going on, to the rest of us, who can do something about it,'' he said.

 A key Cabinet member resigned today after apologizing for having an extra-marital affair, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> gave the job to a woman. <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, 61, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, was named to replace <PERSON> Tokuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>, 69, as chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary, a highly visible post that includes speaking on behalf of the government and coordinating Cabinet affairs. She is the first woman ever to hold the post. It is the second sex scandal to hit the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in two months. <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> announced his resignation as prime minister in July amid allegations he had an extra-marital affair with an ex-geisha. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>'s appointment was widely seen as intended to contain damage caused by the latest scandal, but analysts and party officials expressed doubt about whether she has enough experience to handle the current situation. `` I was just appointed and I ca n't really tell what it is going to be like,'' she said in a news conference. `` But as far as my near 40-year professional experience is concerned, I never felt any handicaps for being a woman.'' <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> announced his resignation this morning after apologizing for an extra-marital affair with a bar hostess 43 years younger than him. `` The <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> administration had placed cleaning up politics at the head of its agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the people ... but in the end I have decided that I must resign,'' <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> told a news conference. He said he had apologized to his wife, <PERSON> Kyoko </PERSON>, and that she had forgiven him. They have been married 45 years and have four grown daughters. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told reporters that he regretted the resignation of <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>, his aide and close friend, but said he would continue to promote political reforms. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> has experience as a housewife as well as that of a bureaucrat,'' he said. `` I would like her to push foward political reforms from the standpoint of the people.'' A former bureaucrat in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> was first elected to the upper house of parliament in 1980. She never held a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post until <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> appointed her two weeks ago to head the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Her late husband, <PERSON> Kinji </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, a member of the lower house of parliament, was transport minister and director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in past governments. <PERSON> Soichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawara </PERSON>, a prominent political critic, said Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>'s appointment `` is apparently aimed at bettering the image of the government. But I ca n't help thinking the choice was made perhaps a little too hastily and lightly. `` She may be helpful in some ways, but I am not confident that a politician with such limited experience can handle perhaps the most demanding position in the Cabinet.'' <PERSON> Tawara </PERSON> added that the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` seems to be ignoring the essence of politics.'' `` As a result,'' he said, `` one problem leads to another. It does n't look like the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>'s trouble ends with this.'' But another political critic, <PERSON> Noriko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimoto </PERSON>, said the unprecedented appointment of a woman to the high office will be a gain for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The task of the chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary may be overwhelming for Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> with her limited experience, but in the long run I believe it was the only positive effect of the ugly sex scandal,'' she said. The immediate goal of <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s 2-week-old administration is to salvage public support for the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But analysts said <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>'s resignation will severely undermine <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s leadership. `` The sex scandal ... will be particularly damaging for the <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> government,'' said promiment political analyst <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>. `` The clean and progressive image was said to be the only strength for the <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> administration, which lacks a strong power base within the party.'' The party's popularity has been severely eroded because its leaders were involved in bribery and sex scandals, and the public also dislikes a new 3 percent sales tax passed by the Liberal Democrats. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who resigned after only two months in office following his sex scandal and the party's worst election defeat. <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> became the sixth Cabinet member, including former prime ministers <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and Uno, to resign in disgrace in less than a year. Leaders of the opposition camp, eager to take over the government for the first time from the Liberal Democrats, quickly opened attack following <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>'s resignation. `` I am completely speechless,'' said <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group. `` I wonder what he thinks women are. It is a reflection of a lack of responsibility of the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Eiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Nukiyama </PERSON>, vice chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` Society has been much more generous toward politicians than ordinary people on matters regarding money and women until recently. But I think, in principle, politics must be based on strong morality, and higher ethical standards should be enforced on politicians.''

<HEAD>Former Top PTL Executive Sentenced to Eight Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> vice president <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> said he was humiliated by his actions that resulted in an eight-year prison sentence and a $ 200,000 fine. `` I failed my master, failed my family and failed myself,'' said <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, as he pleaded for mercy at his sentencing Thursday. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s sentence was part of a plea agreement in exchange for testimony against <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, founder of the television ministry, whose trial on the same fraud and conspiracy charges starts Monday. `` I could not believe that I participated in this ... in deceiving people, in doing something I knew was wrong,'' <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> said after prosecutors showed the judge charts detailing a pattern of financial manipulations at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. `` The shame of that was the most humiliating thing I have ever known.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said memos between <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> financial office showed calculated attempts to hide <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s financial difficulties. `` The victims in this case are in the thousands,'' she said. `` They are waiting to see the court's assessments. They are waiting for justice.'' <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s top assistant at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty earlier this month to four counts of conspiracy and fraud and agreed to testify against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is charged with using ministry funds to finance his opulent lifestyle, including expensive homes, cars and an air-conditioned dog house. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> is the third former <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aide to be convicted. Former aides <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, were convicted of evading taxes on $ 1.1 million in ministry funds that prosecutors said they used to buy <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> jewelry, designer clothes and a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment. They will be sentenced Sept. 8. Thursday, prosecutors presented evidence that even though <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said there would be a limit of 30,000 `` lifetime partnerships'' sold in the Towers Hotel at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> religious theme park, 68,755 partnerships were sold. Lifetime partners made a one-time donation of $ 1,000 in exchange for three nights' free lodging each year for life, but the Towers Hotel and other hotels planned for <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> were never built or were left uncompleted. Prosecutors said the Towers project alone generated $ 74.2 million but only $ 11.4 million was spent on the uncompleted facility. The indictment alleges that the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives spent more than $ 4 million on themselves and used some of it for operating expenses. The charts showed that <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> collected $ 1,128,735 in salaries, bonuses and tax-deferred retirement payments between January 1984 and June 1987. The bonuses alone in those three years amounted to $ 550,000. Investigators also said that <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> lived rent-free in a PTL-owned home valued at $ 400,000 and that he had asked <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s builder to `` bury'' $ 233,000 in parsonage renovations in the construction account for the Towers Hotel project <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> did n't attempt to blame <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` I lost the thing that I lived for _ my ministry,'' he said, his voice cracking, before he was sentenced. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> four years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine on the wire fraud charge, and four years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine on the conspiracy. The prison terms were consecutive.

<HEAD>Personality Traits in Compulsive Gamblers Linked to Biological Factors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Compulsive gamblers have disturbances in their central nervous systems that may partly emerge in their personalities, particularly in their tendency to be risk takers and sensation seekers, a study says. But experts in treating compulsive gamblers said the study can not answer the question of whether the altered chemical activity is a cause or a result of gambling, or whether it might characterize all hooked gamblers. The study found that high levels of certain chemical reactions in the nervous systems of 17 compulsive gamblers were associated with high scores for `` extraversion'' on a written personality test. `` Extraversion'' is a psychiatric term for the tendency to be outgoing, physically and socially active and to take risks, psychiatrists say. The researchers, who reported their findings in the August issue of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION>, said the chemicals they studied are important in the phenomenon of physical arousal. Physical arousal, previous research suggests, may `` be both a major reinforcer and a maintaining factor in pathological gambling,'' said the study, conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. Researchers looked at chemicals taken from blood, urine and spinal fluid that indicated activity in the body's noradrenergic system, which governs such diverse processes as the functioning of organs and communications between nerve cells in the brain. Subjects were men who had met the psychiatric definition of compulsive gamblers and who participated as inpatients at an <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> research unit in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, said the authors of the study, led by Dr. <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>. He could not be reached for comment Thursday, when his telephone went unanswered. `` What's most important about the article is that people are beginning to realize that compulsive gambling is an illness, which is something I do n't think <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> is ready to admit,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which runs a treatment program for pathological gamblers. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>, was banned from major-league baseball for life Thursday for betting on his own team _ allegations that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> denies. But <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, immediate past president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, cautioned that the study could n't say whether the chemical activity preceded the gambling or followed it. And he said the small sample of subjects did not justify generalizations about all compulsive gamblers. <PERSON> Durand </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a research psychologist and a board member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Compulsive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gambling </ORGANIZATION>, agreed. `` I think the research ... is very important, but it needs further testing and verification,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday from <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he is psychology director of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> hospital. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said his own theory on addictions, based on 30 years of research, is that regardless of biological conditions, `` all addicts have had a childhood where they've been subject to experiences that make them feel inferior. ... They feel inadequate, and no matter what they do it's never enough.'' Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, a psychiatrist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said he has found a close association between compulsive gambling and outstanding athletes. `` Being people who are drawn to action and activity as a way of dealing with problems, a way of soothing and comforting themselves, it is very natural for them to be attracted to sports. ... They frequently excel in sports,'' he said. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Falzon </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Compulsive Gambling, a research, training and referral group, said the study should not be used as an excuse by gamblers. `` People are responsible for their behavior,'' she said in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` Even treatment -LRB- programs -RRB- for this disorder ... also suggest the individual must repay society for what they've done. It does n't excuse them because they have this disease.''

 A second rebel group in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> has accepted former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as an observer in peace talks and called on the Ethiopian government to `` respond quickly'' to the proposal. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement in a clandestine radio broadcast. `` The <ORGANIZATION> TPLF </ORGANIZATION> fears that the talks can be delayed while looking for observers and, therefore, accepts former American President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who has expressed his readiness to be an observer at the talks,'' the group said Monday. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> already is to act as an observer in peace talks between <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s government and another rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled to begin in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Sept. 7 The Eritreans, in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> province, have been fighting for independence since 1961.

 The nation's rate of death from breast cancer is increasing and it's worse across the northern states, although federal cancer specialists ca n't explain why. The annual death rate from breast cancer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986, the latest year available, was 32.8 per 100,000 women, up 5 percent from 1979's 31.1, the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The mortality rate in 1986 was 12 percent higher for black women than for white women. Breast cancer killed 40,534 women in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Still, the disease is survivable in most cases. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 75 percent of breast cancer patients live at least another five years. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, with an annual breast cancer death rate of 41 per 100,000 women, had a rate nearly double that of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, which was lowest at 23 per 100,000. Each of the dozen states with the highest rates was in the northern half of the country. In contrast, all but three of the bottom dozen were in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> or Southwest. `` We do n't know why that is,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a cancer specialist with the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>. `` It likely has something to do with the distribution of risk factors for breast cancer, but we do n't know which ones those are.'' Overall, breast cancer death rates have increased for women born in each succeeding decade in this century. For example, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said, women born in the 1930s are showing a higher rate than those born in the'20s, whose rate was higher than those born in the teens. That trend is apparently continuing, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said, although many women born in this century are just entering _ or have n't yet entered _ their years of greatest risk for breast cancer. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said more than half of all breast cancer deaths occur in women 65 or older. Breast cancer's risk factors include family history and childbearing at older ages. Another possible risk factor is a diet high in animal fat, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said, although some researchers question that. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researchers believe at least 19 percent of the deaths attributed to breast cancer could have been prevented if the victims had undergone recommended mammograms, which screen for breast cancer. Women are seven times more likely to have mammograms if their doctor urges it, but <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said that as many as nine out of 10 doctors do n't follow the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s advice and recommend the procedure. `` We think it's crucial for physicians to become informed of the guidelines and recommend to their patients that they get screening mammograms,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> recommends that women 40 and over have a breast exam every year. Women 40-49 also should have mammograms every year or two, and the society advises that women 50 and older should have mammograms each year. Previous studies cited by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> have indicated that fewer than three in 10 eligible women reported having a mammogram in the previous year, and nearly half of women surveyed said no professional had ever recommended they get a mammogram.

 Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> and two other opposition lawmakers were indicted today on charges connected with a lawmaker's secret and illegal trip to Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, denounced the indictments as political persecution and said all the charges against him and others were fabricated to discredit his opposition group. `` I have nothing to fear. I will squarely face trial,'' he told supporters. Also today, leftist students students yelling `` Yankee go home!'' and `` Overthrow -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' battled riot police with iron bars, clubs, firebombs and rocks. Police firing tear gas from two armored vans clashed with about l ,000 students inside <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> after the demonstrators tried to march from the campus Students demanded the withdrawal of 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, which they claim hinder talks on unification with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. They also demanded the release of a radical female student who was jailed after making an unauthorized trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Also today, about 400 radical students at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hankuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> battled police for two hours with firebombs. No arrests or injuries were reported in the protests. Prosecutors charged in the indictments that <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and two party lawmakers failed to report <PERSON> National </PERSON> <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON>'s secret trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last year, a violation of national security laws The three indicted politicians will not be jailed pending trial, prosecutors said. If convicted, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, party floor leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-ki </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul-yong </PERSON> could be sentenced to up to five years in prison. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> said his trial may never take place because the government knows it has no chance of winning the case. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was expelled from the party on June 28, the same day he was arrested on charges of espionage, violating a ban on unauthorized travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and receiving $ 120,000 from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> agents before and during his secret trip to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> last August. Prosecutors said they have evidence <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> knew about <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s trip in advance The opposition leader denies the charge. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, 64, also was charged with violating the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Currency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly receiving $ 10,000 from <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, who is said to have received it from North Korean agents. However, prosecutors said the opposition leader apparently did not know the money came from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, so the charge was limited to a minor violation that requires anyone receiving foreign currency to report it within 10 days. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> said his party will hold a rally in the western city of <LOCATION> Bupyong </LOCATION> on Saturday to protest what he called `` deliberate political persecution.'' The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government prohibits unauthorized travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Also today, a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> appellate court reduced the sentence given to the brother of former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> to two years in prison and a fine of $ 477,000 for embezzlement. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Ki-hwan </PERSON>, 55, was arrested last year for diverting $ 4.3 million in public money after he took over a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> fish market in 1985 with the help of government officials. He was convicted by a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> district court and sentenced to four years' imprisonment and a fine of $ 1.5 million. He appealed the guilty verdict. About a dozen members of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>'s family have been linked to corruption since he left office last year after a seven-year rule. The former president himself went into rural exile late last year after publicly apologizing for corruption committed under his administration.

 Frustrated by two years of inaction and red tape, neighbors of an alleged crack house turned to small claims court and successfully sued the building's owner. `` It was an act of desperation,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, one of 15 neighbors of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who filed the lawsuit, charging the house was a nuisance and a threat to safety.

 Western leaders quickly gave strong backing to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s first non-Communist prime minister in more than 40 years, and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said it hoped its relations with the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> government would remain close. After <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elected <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> to the post Thursday, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised `` our strong support as -LRB- <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> -RRB- seeks to lead his country toward economic recovery and democratic change.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s `` political wisdom in endorsing a government reflecting the genuine will of the Polish people and Solidarity, under the leadership of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, for its constructive role in helping bring about a new beginning in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Danish Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, who was visiting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said: `` You are seeing right now very positive and exciting international developments.'' But Communist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> criticized the new government today, condemning `` anti-socialist forces backed and abetted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the West for fomenting a deep political crisis in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' A transcript of a commentary in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <PERSON> Nhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Danh </PERSON>, seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, said a fierce struggle was going on in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> between `` revolutionary and pro-socialist forces and ... counterrevolutionary and anti-Socialist forces. `` Taking advantage of the increasing economic political difficulties deliberately caused and aggravated by themselves, the opposition ... aided by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as well as the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- Church has been carrying out hectic activities, blaming the -LRB- Communist -RRB- Party and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for the troubles and trying to increase their influence on the people,'' it said. It said the `` complicated struggle'' in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will `` rally the working class'' to fight anti-socialist forces and resolve the `` present crisis.'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> was nominated as prime minister by Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and approved by Polish lawmakers, including a majority of the Communist delegation. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, Italian Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> sent a message of congratulations and said he hoped <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would `` consolidate its democratic and reformist course.'' Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said: `` We shall regard <PERSON> Comrade </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as our partner in the relations that link our two countries.'' The Council of Ministers, or Soviet cabinet, sent <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> a cable of `` friendly congratulations,'' and added: `` We express the certainty that the traditional relations of friendship and all-round cooperation between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will continue developing on the basis of sovereign equality and respect, mutual benefit and mutual responsibility.'' West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> sent `` heartfelt best wishes'' to <LOCATION> Mazowieck </LOCATION>. `` I wish God's blessing on the tasks ... lying ahead of you,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. He said added his government would `` do all in its power to support you on the chosen path.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he hoped for closer relations with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, especially since 1989 is the 50th anniversary of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the start of World War II. `` I am convinced that our two countries in this year ... should move closer together ... to smooth the way for a lasting reconciliation between our two peoples,'' he wrote. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s message recalled `` with much pleasure'' her meeting with <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> in November, when she visited <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and his colleagues in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Her office said she reaffirmed `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s readiness to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to achieve democracy and economic recovery,'' but listed what she saw as the three main challenges facing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>: `` The need to form a government that truly reflects the will of the Polish people; to take <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> along the path of democracy; to implement the difficult decisions necessary to restore <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic health.'' Swedish Prime Minister <PERSON> Ingvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlsson </PERSON> welcomed the latest `` development in the democratic process in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' `` The new Polish government, it is true, has no easy task,'' he said. `` It faces great and difficult problems, especially in the economic sphere.'' His government hoped for `` increased and deeper cooperation with the new government in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, not the least concerning problems that can be solved best through international cooperation.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality two years ago, insists his sexual preference is not relevant to the way he performs his job in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` If you ask the direct question: ` Are you gay?' the answer is: Yes. So what?'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said in May 1987 when he became the second member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to discuss his homosexuality in public. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, a fellow <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat, also is an acknowledged homosexual. `` I do n't think my sex life is relevant to my job,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said at the time. `` But on the other hand I do n't want to leave the impression that I'm embarrassed about my life.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a five-term congressman, acknowledged today that he hired a male prostitute as a personal employee but fired him after becoming suspicious the man was selling sex from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s home on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The lawmaker said he met the man in 1985 through an `` escort-model'' advertisement in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gay newspaper. He admitted having paid for sex with the man, but said the relationship later became one of friendship. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he `` showed poor judgment'' in hiring the man, but had no direct proof the man was engaging in prostitution from the congressman's apartment. The liberal Democrat said he saw no reason why he should resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or should not seek re-election in 1990. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 49, was first elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 and re-elected in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' 4th Congressional District in November 1988 by a 70 percent to 30 percent margin over his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> opponent, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who is not married, contended in June 1987 that most of his constituents do n't care that he's homosexual. `` Hardly anyone is interested in the sex life of a boring, middle-aged politician,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` As long as a person is kind, loving and caring, not much else matters.'' In February 1988, he said `` voters care about performance in office,'' not about personal issues such as sexual preference. But his homosexuality became enmeshed in controversy this summer when the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> mailed a memo comparing his voting record with that of new House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. The memo, titled, `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>: Out of the Liberal Closet,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record was as liberal as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> contended the memo was `` extraordinarily scurrilous'' and implied he viewed it as an effort to portray <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as homosexual. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he might reveal the identity of homosexual Republican congressmen if such attacks on Democrats continued. The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> aide who wrote the memo resigned and <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> apologized to <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he decided to acknowledge his homosexuality after public scrutiny of the private lives of former Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> and the late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who is married, was forced to withdraw from the 1988 race after being linked with model <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>. <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> died of AIDS in 1987. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has worked for approval of legislation requiring replacement of low-income housing demolished under urban renewal, a bill requiring special prosecutors to investigate alleged wrongdoing by public officials, and legislation barring the government from denying visas based on politics. `` We would have more money for health issues if it were n't for increased defense spending,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> in July 1988. Regarding anti-abortion activists, he once said: `` Sure, they're pro-life They believe that life begins at conception and ends at birth.'' He also contended the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ignored the AIDS issue. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on housing and employment, which is investigating the influence-peddling scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. Born in <LOCATION> Bayonne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was executive assistant to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> and an administrative assistant to Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, D-Mass., before being elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> in 1973 He served in the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> until he was elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> earned his bachelor's degree from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in 1962 and his law degree in 1977 from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.

 A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman was jailed for two days and her sons were put into a foster home when authorities in two states mistook her for a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> woman who fled with her two sons after losing a custody battle. Not only do <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Clewiston </LOCATION>, and her 8 - and 6-year-old sons bear striking resemblances to <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> and her children, but the boys have the same names _ <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> _ and are about the same age, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> police said Mrs. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON> disappeared with her two sons from <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, two years ago in defiance of a court order awarding the sons' custody to their Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> _ a large-boned woman with a Southern accent and light brown hair _ matches Mrs. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>'s description. `` I'm still not believing it happened,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> said Thursday after finally getting her boys back. `` They put me through torture.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON>' nightmare began in early August. A <LOCATION> Clewiston </LOCATION> teacher spotted pictures of the Butcher boys on a missing children's poster, noticed they looked like the Dobbins boys and notified police <LOCATION> Clewiston </LOCATION> police notified police in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>, confirming the mothers' resemblance and the boys' resemblance _ and identical names and ages. <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> police then obtained a fugitive warrant from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> charging Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> _ whom they thought was Mrs. Butcher _ with child concealment. Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> was arrested Aug. 18 while visiting her husband at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he had undergone gall-bladder surgery. `` I said, ` I'm not her. I'm <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON>,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> recounted. `` They did n't believe me.'' `` I do n't think we did anything wrong to apologize for,'' said <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. `` I'm sorry if we put them out. We were going on police instincts.'' After being fingerprinted, strip-searched and booked at <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>, she finally got to a telephone _ 12 hours later. That was when she discovered that state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> workers had taken her children and put them in a temporary home. The frightened boys also told authorities they were making a mistake. `` I was scared I would n't see my mom again,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> said. On Saturday, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, an attorney from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, where Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> once lived, spent all day on the phone trying to convince the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and police they had the wrong woman. Police finally checked to see whether Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> had Mrs. <PERSON> Butcher </PERSON>'s markings _ a butterfly tattoo and two Caesarean scars. She did not, and police freed her Sunday. But <PERSON> Black </PERSON> then decided Mrs. <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> could have been a baby sitter for the missing Butcher boys, and the HRS refused to release the <PERSON> Dobbins </PERSON> brothers. It took two more days of legal wrangling, including exchanges of photographs between police in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, before the boys were returned to their parents. `` The court system should n't work this way,'' <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> said. `` People are entitled to better treatment than this.''

<HEAD>Sales of Existing Homes Up for Second Straight Month</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of existing homes rose 1.2 percent in July, posting the first back-to-back increase after high mortgage rates produced consecutive declines in the first five months of 1989, a real estate trade group reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said sales of existing single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.40 million units in July, up from June's revised 3.36 million units. June's increase was the first in sales since December 1988 and the largest since December 1986, when sales jumped 6.6 percent. `` The downswing in -LRB- mortgage interest -RRB- rates is pulling some buyers off the sidelines,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that average fixed-rate mortgages fell from 10.03 percent to 9.81 percent during July. The Realtors also reported the median price of a home rose $ 3,000 to $ 96,400, a 3.2 percent increase over June and 6.3 percent over the previous year. The median price means half the homes cost more, half less. The median price reflects the dominance of higher-priced home sales, said <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> chief economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, and `` a relatively low volume of sales in the lower-priced starter range.'' `` The loss of the entry-level buyer is taking a bite out of the market,'' <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON> added. But while the July increase in sales was small, said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, `` taken in the context of all other recent economic indicators, it's got to be encouraging. I think we'll see more moderate rises as the year goes on.'' Regionally, sales were led in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where the resale pace rose 9.8 percent to 560,000 units. Next was the South, which recorded a 3.1 percent increase to 1.32 million units. In the West, however, sales fell 5 percent to 570,000 units. Sales also dropped in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, 5.2 percent to 910,000 units. Median prices were $ 147,000 in the Northeast, $ 88,200 in the South, $ 138,200 in the West and $ 73,500 in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>.

 Angolan rebels said today that 77 government troops and six rebels were killed in heavy fighting this week. The casualty toll was one of the highest reported since a cease-fire was declared in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in June. In a statement released in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels said 19 rebels were injured in the clashes that occurred earlier this week in the central and southern provinces of <LOCATION> Cuand-Cubango </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cunene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Huambo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuanza </LOCATION>. The statement said the rebels shot down a Soviet-built Mi-25 helicopter, destroyed four tanks and several combat vehicles, and captured arms and ammunition in the fighting. There was no independent confirmation of the attacks from the government in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> claimed government warplanes killed 150 people in a raid on <LOCATION> Mavinga </LOCATION>. Casualty reports are often exaggerated by both sides and news organizations are rarely able to verify them. A source close to the government said in a telephone interview that Angolan Defense Minister <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonha </PERSON> would meet later today with his Zairean counterpart along the border in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s northeastern corner The source could not confirm the purpose of the meeting but said he expected an official statement to be released. Cooperation between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> has increased recently since President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Seko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> began mediating in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s civil war before a summit of 18 African leaders at <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> on June 22 The summit produced a historic handshake between Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> that sealed a short-lived truce in their 14-year-old civil war. The truce began collapsing one week later and was formally renounced Thursday by <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>. He acted after seven African leaders met Tuesday in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, and supported <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' claims that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> had accepted a `` temporary and voluntary retirement'' from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> during peace negotiations. Western-backed <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> acronym for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, have been fighting the government and its <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> allies to force a power-sharing agreement since shortly after <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> was not party to U.S.-brokered international accords signed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> pledged to halt aid to the guerrillas and allow <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to gain independence. In return, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> began a phased withdrawal of its estimated 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> still receives $ 15 - $ 18 million annually in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid

 Security agents found an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gold merchant in a well today after he was kidnapped by masked Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, officials said. One kidnap suspect was arrested. <PERSON> Shaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON>, 47, who reportedly went to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to collect debts, was located by <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> secret service agents during a search involving helicopters and hundreds of soldiers and police. `` I am healthy, thank God, and thank you to the Israeli army and all the soldiers who helped me,'' <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>, commander of troops in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, also said on the radio that <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> had been held in the well after being brought to an Arab village near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. `` We found the well and brought him out, and I identified him and he is all right,'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said. Army officials said <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> was found standing in about 5 feet of water at the bottom of a 20-foot-deep well in the Arab village of <LOCATION> Abush </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> said he had been taken from a taxi by unknown men Wednesday night. `` I did n't know them, and I do n't know their names,'' he said. The radio said he had spoken to his family in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy military spokesman, said <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> agents were led to the scene by an Arab suspect who was captured Thursday. He said other suspects were being sought. `` The motive is not known. The investigation is looking into whether it is political or criminal or both,'' said <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> was the first Israeli civilian abducted during the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising, prompting speculation that underground leaders had opted for new tougher tactics as part of their revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. However, officials also said they were investigating possible criminal motives for his kidnapping.

 A Soviet envoy who met with <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and Moslem leaders called today for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said the warring factions should lift blockades on each other's ports. French radio stations reported today that ships of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sixth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> were anchored about 50 miles off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>, the same distance as a French flotilla of warships. Pro-Iranian groups have threatened to attack the French ships if they intervene militarily in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> says it sent the ships to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to evacuate French nationals if the fighting worsens. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a Soviet foreign ministry spokesman denied <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> radio reports that the Soviet missile launcher Kirov was headed to join other Soviet warships in the area. `` There are no Soviet military vessels off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s coast,'' spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said. He said `` no Soviet military vessels are heading to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s shores. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> station in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Sixth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> vessels visiting the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> were coordinating activity with the French task force. It did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> declined comment on the reports. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the Sixth Fleet was not engaged in unusual activities and that its ships have not teamed up with those of the French flotilla. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declined to say precisely where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet was located. Police said one person was killed and four wounded in overnight and early morning clashes between Syrian and Christian forces in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and in the mountains southeast of the capital. The latest casualties raised the overall toll from five months of fighting between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mostly Christian troops and Syrian forces with their Moslem militia allies to 792 killed and 2,218 wounded. The conflict began March 8 after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded Moslem-run ports south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and its Moslem allies retaliated by shelling and besieging the Christian heartland and ports north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Soviet envoy <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> met today with <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Patriarch <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bkirki </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, before driving to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s eastern <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> suburb for a meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. He told reporters his talks were `` useful,'' adding: `` The patriarch and I agreed that the time is ripe for a political solution.'' `` Everything should be discussed politically and far from military solutions ... A cease-fire should go into effect and blockades should be lifted,'' <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> said without elaborating. The Soviet envoy walked the last 500 yards along a shell-pitted road to the hilltop presidential palace, where <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has his headquarters in an underground bunker. The two-story palace has come under heavy Syrian shelling since <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared a `` war of liberation'' to drive out the Soviet-equipped Syrian army. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> claims to be in complete harmony with the Soviets over the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> crisis, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomats have reported serious differences between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, which has refused <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> appeals to withdraw from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Syrians also refuse to negotiate directly with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON>, who heads the Soviet foreign ministry's <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> department, held lengthy talks with Acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, after arriving Thursday in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He refused to speak to reporters before the meeting with <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>. But sources at <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>' Moslem cabinet, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> was promoting a comprehensive peace plan to halt the confrontation and begin a political dialogue among Lebanese leaders to end the 14-year civil war. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> discussed the Lebanese situation with Syrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Sharaa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The two nations are bound by a treaty of friendship and cooperation. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofeili </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, said the pro-Iranian radical Shiite group was `` in a state of war with the French forces.'' `` We shall practice our right in this regard and defend ourselves against the French who have declared war on us by coming close to our coast,'' <PERSON> Tofeili </PERSON> said in a statement carried today by An-nahar and other publications. A previously unknown group calling itself the Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed also pledged to `` confront the flagrant French military intervention in internal <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> affairs.'' The group, in a statement delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said its `` Mujahedeen -LRB- holy warriors -RRB- are ready to carry out God's verdict in striking at western interests, topped by French interests.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has said its six-ship flotilla was sent on a `` humanitarian'' mission to help evacuate the estimated 7,000 French nationals living in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the situation deteriorated. However, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s allies claimed the French warships were on a mission to support <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.

 Four young white men were charged today with being part of a gang accused of killing one black teen-ager and chasing three others from a white neighborhood with baseball bats. The gang of as many as 30 white youths, intent on preventing an interracial couple from meeting, attacked the black teen-agers Wednesday night as they were going to meet someone selling a used car, authorities said. The killing of <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 16, was reminiscent of the 1986 <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> case, in which a group of white teen-agers in the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> chased three blacks, one of whom was hit by a car and killed. In <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s mostly Italian-Jewish <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> section Wednesday night, the white gang gathered to waylay blacks or Hispanics they believed were headed for a young white woman's birthday party in the neighborhood, authorities said. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the 18-year-old woman had recently jilted her white boyfriend and had been dating black and Hispanic men. The spurned boyfriend had threatened the girl and made comments to her about `` your nigger boyfriend'' and `` bringing niggers into the neighborhood,'' said Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON>. The slain youth's father stood Thursday night on his own <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> street, which is mostly black, and laid the blame squarely on racism. `` My son will never turn this corner again and it's only because of this: the pigment of his skin,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> said bitterly. Four young <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> men whom police believe were part of the gang were taken into custody. <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, 18; <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON>, 18; <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stressler </PERSON>, 21 were charged today with assault, riot, aggravated harassment, violation of civil rights, menacing and possessing a weapon, said Sgt. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollomon </PERSON>. The weapon was a bat. <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON> also were charged with conspiracy, <PERSON> Hollomon </PERSON> said. Police said none of those arrested fired the shots that killed the victim. Police said the former boyfriend was being sought for questioning. Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> at a news conference Thursday, called the killing `` an enormous tragedy.'' Other candidates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Sept. 12 mayoral primary issued statements deploring the killing. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, in a virtual dead heat with <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> for the Democratic nomination, said he accused no one of causing the racial violence but added: `` The tone and climate of this city does get set at City Hall.'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and his friends, <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Banner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON>, both 18, and <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, 17, went into the neighborhood to answer a newspaper ad for a used car. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the whites followed the blacks for about a block and a half and witnesses heard them say: `` Are these the ones? Is this them?'' What they did n't know was that the girlfriend had told her new boyfriend, a Hispanic, not to come and called off her birthday party, <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> said the girl, <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>, saw the killing from her window. `` She knew there was going to be trouble. There were rumblings in the neighborhood. Her mother had looked out the window and saw the boys with the bats,'' <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> said. When the white gang stopped and confronted the blacks, four shots were heard. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> fell with two shots in the chest. Banner had an injury to the arm, but it was n't known whether it was from a grazing bullet or a blow, police said. The other two were unhurt. The gang scattered. When police arrived they found four .32 - caliber shells and several bats No gun was recovered despite police searches of a parked car and sewers. `` This neighborhood is definitely prejudiced. They do n't like blacks. They do n't like Puerto Ricans,'' said <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Carretta </PERSON>, a 26-year-old lifelong <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> resident. Others said <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> was no more prejudiced than other communities. Yet, one teen-age girl standing not far from where <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was killed said: `` The black people do n't belong here. ... This is our neighborhood.'' <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> was the scene of a racial incident on Christmas Day 1987 in which two black men were allegedly beaten by a gang of white youths while they collected bottles in a shopping cart. Two arrests were made in the attack, which spawned a protest march through the neighborhood by 400 blacks as angry white residents jeered and shouted `` <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON>!'' at the participants.

 Police have arrested three people in the slaying of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, the British conservationist known as the Lion Man of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, the governing party newspaper reported today. The <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> Times said police arrested the three men in the northern Kora National Reserve. It did not say when the arrests occurred. Authorities began searching the area Sunday after <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> and two assistants were shot and killed in an encounter with three robbers armed with automatic rifles. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> trained lions born in captivity to return to the wild. The Times, owned by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said police were interrogating the suspects and planned to parade them before <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s workers who witnessed the shooting for possible identification. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilonzo </PERSON> was not immediately available for comment, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, the director of wildlife management, said he had no way to confirm or deny the report. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s slaying was the third fatal attack in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s wilds since July. Publicity surrounding his death and the slayings of an American woman and a French couple threatens to harm <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s tourism industry, the country's number one foreign exchange earner. Officials say travel is basically safe. They blame the recent violence partly on a massive effort to save <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s elephants, which they say has driven well-armed poachers into other forms of banditry. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, 83, earned international fame by his efforts along with his wife <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> to return lions to the wild. Their achievements were detailed in the film `` Born Free'' and a sequel, `` Living Free.'' Both movies were based on books by <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, who was killed at the northwestern <ORGANIZATION> Shamba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 by a servant she had dismissed on suspicion of theft. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> moved into <ORGANIZATION> Kora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and helped dozens of lions learn to survive in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> before turning them loose. He and <PERSON> Joy </PERSON>, who separated in the late 1960, had no children. <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, whose body was flown to <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> Aug. 21, would be buried with honors at <ORGANIZATION> Kora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> next week.

 A former aide to hotel queen <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was unfairly charged in a tax evasion and extortion scheme in an attempt to bring down his boss, a lawyer argued today in closing arguments. `` He was swept up in order to get at Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>,'' attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> was a man who was up front'' in the <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> organization. <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, who was Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s top aide and is now her co-defendant, is also charged with conspiracy to commit extortion. <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> discounted the allegation that <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> forced liquor salespeople to make kickbacks to keep accounts at the Helmsley hotels. He called <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> a tough-talking executive who merely negotiated rebates or discounts to get Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> the best possible price. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> planned to deliver the government's rebuttal later today. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>, 69, is accused of evading $ 1.2 million in federal taxes by charging personal expenses, including renovations at her <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> estate, to her businesses. On Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s lawyer spent eight hours dissecting the government's case against her, then wrapped up his closing argument with an emotional plea for acquittal. `` Please end the suffering, the terrible suffering of Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and let her walk out of this courthouse a free woman,'' the attorney, <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>, said Thursday. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> cried and appeared shaken after <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> told the jury it would be a mistake to vote a conviction on any of the 41 counts on which she is charged. He told the jury in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> that many of the prosecution witnesses who had worked for her had a motivation to testify against her. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> had a lot of enemies and these people came here to pay her back,'' <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> said. `` These people had an agenda and that agenda was to get her.'' <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and another former aide, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, are charged with assisting in the scheme. The charges against Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> include conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, tax evasion, filing false returns, mail fraud and conspiracy to commit extortion. The extortion conspiracy charge carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence upon conviction. The other charges carry three - to five-year sentences <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>, who made Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s harsh personality an issue during the trial, told the jurors to disregard the stories of her wrath. `` If in fact she mistreated people, I beg you ladies and gentlemen to leave that decision to a higher authority,'' he said. The defense attorney also brushed aside testimony from Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s former housekeeper, who said Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> once told her, `` We do n't pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.'' He said the statement made no sense because <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> paid $ 57.8 million in federal taxes in 1983-85, the years covered in the indictment. `` I can see her complaining about all the taxes she did pay. That would be more like Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON> said. On Wednesday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Seibel </PERSON> said the statement showed Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s `` selfishness, greed and sheer arrogance.'' After <PERSON> Feffer </PERSON>'s argument, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Benfante </PERSON>, <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>'s lawyer, argued his client's innocence with humor. He had the entire courtroom laughing as he focused on the tense relationship between Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> was Mr. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s Jiminy Cricket, his conscience,'' <PERSON> Benfante </PERSON> said. `` He'd tell Mr. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> she's spending his money again and she'd go nuts.'' He described <PERSON> Licari </PERSON> as a respected, trusted and honest employee. `` He would not be part of a fraud, even if there was one,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he expected deliberations to begin late today or Saturday morning.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> ordered military planes to begin carrying civilians after mass resignations by the nation's airline pilots grounded all domestic service. <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> also said he would allow international airlines to carry domestic passengers in an attempt to break one of the most bitter labor disputes in recent Australian history. `` If we cave in to the pilots' demands <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> is dead,'' <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said on Thursday. The domestic airline industry shut down Thursday as carriers began dismissing pilots for not honoring their contracts. All 1,600 pilots retaliated by resigning en masse. The pilots went on strike Aug. 18, refusing to work beyond the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. They are demanding a 30 percent wage increase, which <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> says will raise annual salaries to $ 100,000. The Labor government has called the raise unacceptable because of a wage-and-income policy limiting increases to 6 percent. Most international airlines, meanwhile, agreed to provide seats for domestic passengers for the Australian segments of international flights.

 The Philippine <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will not ratify a treaty extending <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases after 1991 without strong pressure from President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, a prominent opposition lawmaker said today. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> maintains <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, the Subic Bay naval base and four smaller installations under an agreement that expires in September 1991. Talks are expected to begin late this year on extending the agreement. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> refuses to say whether she supports a new agreement, which must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, 12 senators called for closing the bases in 1991, showing the <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration lacks the votes for ratification. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the most dominant political group in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, announced after a two-hour closed-door meeting late today that it would oppose any extension of the bases treaty. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s president, said his party will ask <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials to withdraw their troops and dismantle the bases upon the expiration of the treaty. He said the party also will conduct a nationwide information campaign against the bases. Eight of the 23 senators belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, making it the most dominant group in the upper chamber. Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, a former defense minister and one of the resolution's co-sponsors, told foreign reporters he believes all 12 co-signers are strongly committed to closing the bases. `` Unless President <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> exerts her power and influence over her coalition members, I think that the 11 will stay committed to the resolution,'' said <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s only opposition member. `` For myself I know how I will vote, and there are no ` ifs' and ` buts' about that.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> claims the bases are essential for maintaining security in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Filipino opponents claim the bases are a vestige of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colonial rule and infringe on national sovereignty. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said the resolution was aimed at pressing Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into notifying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the bases will not be extended. That would give <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> time to relocate its forces elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> to find alternative uses for the facilities, he said. `` I think that the 11 other members who cosigned the resolution with me seem to be very committed in what was stated in the resolution, that the Military Bases Agreement should not be extended beyond ... 1991,'' <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said. He suggested that <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s international airport be relocated to <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of the capital. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> said he believed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could remove its 40,000 service members, military dependents and civilian employees within six months. In the resolution, the 12 senators ruled out a phased withdrawal that would last beyond 1991, as called for by some Filipino lawmakers. `` Whereas to be fair to all concerned, the undersigned manifest that they are opposed to any further extension of the presence of foreign military bases in our country beyond 1991,'' the resolution says. In October 1988, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to pay $ 481 million a year to keep the bases until 1991. Filipino officials had asked for $ 2 billion and are expected to press for more money during future talks. The issue is expected to figure in talks during Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in November The bases provide jobs to about 70,000 Filipinos and pay more than $ 96 million annually in civilian salaries.

 Two markers have been placed at the site of a fiery church bus crash that claimed 27 lives last year.

Many of the members of his church, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> of God in <LOCATION> Radcliff </LOCATION>, are family and friends of the victims. They were angered when they learned a state highway crew on March 28 had removed a makeshift memorial of two crosses surrounded by flowers in the median. The markers, on both sides of Interstate 71, are typical highway markers, green with white lettering, and say `` SITE OF FATAL BUS CRASH MAY 14, 1988.'' A final decision on the markers was made Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief engineer, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, after he met with state Sen. <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, to whom the markers were presented. <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON> learned from state officials that the earlier memorial had been designated a traffic hazard because drivers had been slowing to look at it. The markers erected Thursday were approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> said there was no ceremony for the 44-by-72-inch markers' installation, `` because if we made a big deal, we might create a traffic hazard.'' The crash occurred when the bus, owned by the Radcliff church, was hit by a pickup truck traveling the wrong way on the interstate. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON>, the pickup's driver, was charged with 27 counts of murder and drunken driving in the accident.

 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said today he hired a male prostitute as a personal employee but fired him two years ago when he became suspicious the man was selling sex from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Capitol Hill apartment. `` I was victimized,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> `` I knew he had been a prostitute. ... I was trying to get him to stop. I did n't know he was expanding his business. From firsthand knowledge I -LRB- still -RRB- do n't know that,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, 49, a liberal Democrat who publicly acknowledged his homosexuality in May 1987. During a news conference later at his office in this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he had shown poor judgement in hiring the man. `` Thinking I was going to be <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and trying to turn him into <PERSON> Pygmalion </PERSON> was the biggest mistake I ever made,'' he said. `` He took me.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he met the man in 1985 through an `` escort-model'' advertisement in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gay newspaper. The congressman admitted paying for sex with the man one time, but said the relationship quickly became one of friendship. He said he no longer uses escort services. In a report in today's editions of The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times, a man identified as <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told the newspaper that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was aware that sex was being sold from the congressman's apartment and was concerned that it might be discovered. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> called those allegations `` absolutely untrue.'' `` His suggestion that he was procuring sex partners for me is a lie,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> also said. When asked if the revelations might force him to resign from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> replied: `` Of course not. Why should it?'' He said he planned to run for re-election for a sixth term in 1990. `` I do n't think I'm going to be heavily penalized by the voters for being suckered by a guy I was trying to help,'' he said. `` I hired him out of a charitable impulse. I misjudged his character. ... I think he was a pretty good con man,'' he said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he hired the man as a personal assistant to do work around his house, drive his car and run errands. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he paid him about $ 20,000 a year for about a year and a half with personal money. He said no government or campaign funds were used. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he fired him in August 1987 after his landlady told him for the second time that the man may have been arranging liaisons at the apartment in <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s absence. `` He was angry. He threatened me with a variety of retributions and apparently he decided the way to to that was go to The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. In a companion story today, the Times reported that the principal of an elementary school in the well-to-do <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, acknowledged that he had allowed <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> to use school offices in 1987. School officials placed the principal on leave after the story broke. The prostitute told the Times he used a telephone in the school guidance counselor's office to arrange liaisons, but <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> denied to the newspaper that he knew what <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was doing. The newspaper said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was a professional name and it did not disclose his real name, but <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> identified the man as <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>. There was no telephone listing for <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> or its suburbs. `` He was a male prostitute and I thought ... that he was smart enough to do something else,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` I said he should get a job. He said he was on probation and could n't get a job because of that.'' The Times said the man's probation stemmed from four felony convictions in 1982: possession of obscene material, production of obscene items involving a juvenile, oral sodomy and possession of cocaine. He also was convicted of cocaine distribution in 1975, the newspaper said. `` I thought I could help him reform,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he wrote letters of reference on his congressional stationery to the probation board to verify that <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> was employed. The congressman said he knew that <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> sometimes stayed at his apartment when he was out of town and that he told <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> there should be no drugs there. `` But it never occurred to me to say do n't engage in prostitution,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he gave <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> a couple of small jobs to do in 1987 after he complained about having a difficult time finding work, but fired him after he `` tried to extort me'' and `` I ordered him not to have any access to me.'' `` Paying for sex, that's one of the things that led me to acknowledge being gay,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said. `` Before, living as a closeted gay man was difficult. ... It was one of the reasons I was vulnerable to being preyed on.'' Asked when was the last time he paid for sex, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> replied: `` I'm not going to get into that.'' He did say he has been in a monogamous homosexual relationship for about two years. `` He's a very sensible person and a steadying influence,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said about his partner. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s homosexuality became the subject of controversy this summer when the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> circulated a memo comparing his voting record with that of new House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. The memo, titled `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>: Out of the Liberal Closet,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record was as liberal as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s. The <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> aide who wrote the memo resigned and <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> apologized to <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Hundreds of video rental shops on Friday received promotional kits for a horror movie with live snakes inside the packages, and outraged animal protection officials called the stunt `` cruel and irresponsible.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals called on <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to take back the 700 reptiles. The snakes were in danger because instructions accompanying the kits had incorrectly said they did not need to be fed for their planned month-long stay in the stores, the society said. It said it was receiving dozens of calls from unhappy shop owners. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brett </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CIC </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing manager, said the snakes were intended to be kept in shops to promote a thriller about voodoo called `` The Serpent and The Rainbow.'' The snakes were bred domestically and the company began sending them out Thursday from its <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> headquarters, he said. The snakes, silver with gray stripes, are not poisonous but might carry harmful parasites if they came from abroad, said <ORGANIZATION> RSPCA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. They needed to be fed weekly, she said. While admitting there'd been `` some confusion,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> denied the snakes would harm anyone or be harmed. `` We've sent out 700 in clear, plastic, aerated boxes as conversation pieces,'' <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> said. `` Snakes make wonderful pets.'' The 18 - to 24-inch snakes used in the promotion came from a company called <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION>, which assured <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> they did not have to be fed for three months, he said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Cane </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s marketing assistant, said: `` Whenever we launch a new video title we normally send to our distributors posters, sleeves and cardboard cut-outs. With this film, we decided to send snakes. In marketing terms it's called live points of sale.'' Some recipients were n't impressed. `` We felt complete and utter horror,'' said a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> video shop manager, who refused to be identified to protect his relations with the distribution company. `` I deplore any living creature used for advertising.'' He said the snake, which `` just appeared out of the blue,'' had been returned to the distribution company's animal supplier. <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> said the snakes were hand-delivered in boxes marked `` Live Animal,'' and claimed shop owners were warned by ads in the trade press and calls from sales agents. At the end of the month, they were to be collected by the company, although if shop owners were unhappy, they could call an emergency number and have them picked up. `` I have spoken to three -LRB- shop owners -RRB- who were less than happy,'' <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> said. `` If we find we were wrong about feeding, then obviously we will take action on that and pull them back immediately.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> RSPCA </ORGANIZATION> was urging unhappy owners to demand that the company take them back, and if they did n't, the <ORGANIZATION> RSPCA </ORGANIZATION> might take some. `` We do n't have the resources to take care of hundreds of snakes,'' she said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottrill </PERSON>, assistant manager at Video Palace shop in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Soho </LOCATION> district, said he did n't particularly mind the snake, whom the staff immediately nicknamed `` Cyril,'' but thought the whole stunt was `` cruel and crass.'' `` It's a pretty second-rate film,'' he said. `` I think they knew full well that all this would happen.''

<HEAD>Existing Home Sales Continued Rebound in July</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of existing homes continued their rebound from high mortgage rates with a 1.2 percent increase in July, a real estate trade group reported Friday, and analysts forecast continued moderate growth the rest of the year. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said existing single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.40 million units in July. That compared with revised figures for June that showed a 4.7 percent increase to 3.36 million units annually. The June-July rebound followed consecutive sales declines in the first five months of the year. Although the July sales hike was relatively small, Chief Economist <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> said `` taken in the context of all other recent economic indicators, it's got to be encouraging. `` I think we'll see more moderate rises as the year goes on,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> is forecasting existing home sales to total 3.41 million units this year, down 5 percent from 1988 in part because higher costs are pricing the entry-level buyer out of the market. `` The downswing in rates is pulling some buyers off the sidelines,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribin </PERSON>, adding that `` the impact of lower mortgage rates is likely to be steady trade-up sales, rather than a sales surge among first-time buyers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that fixed-rate mortgages fell from a peak of 11.22 percent in March to 9.81 percent during July. The <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> said the median price of a home in July was $ 96,400, which Realtors Chief Economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON> said `` suggests a relatively low volume of sales in the lower-priced starter range.'' The median price _ meaning half the homes cost more, half less _ was up 3.2 percent from June and 6.3 percent from the previous year. `` The single largest percentage _ 13.8 percent _ of existing home sales made nationwide in July came in the price category of $ 120,000 to $ 159,999,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NAR </ORGANIZATION> said. Regionally, the Northeast led sales with a 9.8 percent increase to 560,000 units despite having the highest median price in the nation, $ 147,900. It was followed by the South with a 3.1 percent increase to 1.32 million units. The median price there was $ 88,300. However the West, with a median price of $ 138,200, saw sales fall 5 percent to 570,000 units. The Midwest, with a median price of $ 73,500, posted a sales decline of 5.2 percent to 910,000 units.

<HEAD>Falkland Islanders Divided About British-Argentine Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN LEONARD</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STANLEY, Falkland Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Falklanders have mixed feelings about talks on restoring relations between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which made their rocky, windswept archipelago a battleground seven years ago. Most residents see negotiations as inevitable, but many fear a deal that could cost them their British status. The first round is scheduled for Oct. 17-18 in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. About 1,800 people live on the bleak islands 300 miles east of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s tip. The main occupations are fishing and grazing sheep on the chill moorlands. `` I think it's a bit worrying, really,'' said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>. `` How far will they go If they carry on, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> will think <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is saying yes to a transfer of sovereignty eventually, I would think.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> is secretary of Desire the Right, the only organized political party. It hs taken no official position on the talks and Mrs. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said her views were personal. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenleyside </PERSON>, an elected member of the islands' executive and legislative councils, welcomeed the talks. He said a briefing by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON>, the colonial governor, convinced him `` we are not moving into a situation where items are being discussed that are specifically against the wishes of the <ORGANIZATION> Falkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Keenleyside </PERSON> added, however, that many people oppose any resumption of links with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and have deep suspicions about the negotiations. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> invaded the British colony, which it calls the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION>, in April 1982 and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sent a naval force that expelled the invaders in a 74-day war that cost nearly 1,000 lives. The Argentines claim the islands under rights dating from <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> colonial days. Attempts to begin talks foundered on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s refusal to negotiate the sovereignty of the islands. They are beginning now because <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s new president, agreed to set the sovereignty issue aside. Most islanders trust Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s determination not to negotiate the islands away, but some wonder what will happen when she leaves office Senior magistrate <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlroy </PERSON> is grateful for movement. `` I'm glad to see there are talks because it seems to me that the stalemate that existed before could not benefit anyone,'' she said. `` I do think some form of link with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> is necessary.'' Issues at stake include shipping, air and communications links with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, all severed since the war. Many islanders want no connections at all. They remember the decade before the war, when the Argentine air force operated the first regular air service to the islands and its ticket office in <LOCATION> Stanley </LOCATION> was an intelligence outpost. When their troops landed, Argentine commanders had detailed military and civilian knowledge of the islands. `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, OK,'' shop owner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Short </PERSON> said about the talks, then added: `` Falklands and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, no.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, commercial officer for Cable and Wireless, said of <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>: `` This man is far too smart. He is going to say all the right things to the right people.'' By playing down the sovereignty issue, he suggested, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> could gradually restore links of all kinds with the islands until the transfer of sovereignty became inevitable. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Newell </PERSON>, a former farm manager, took the view that `` we're going to have to deal with them sometime,'' and lawyer <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilmartin </PERSON> said: `` It's quite obvious that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> should talk to each other. <PERSON> Kilmartin </PERSON> said he hoped <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would allow the Falklands government to make policy in those areas of particular concern to the islanders. Among the thorniest issues is protection of fish stocks in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, where Argentine and Falkland fishing zones abut. Islanders also want <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to stop influencing other <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations to deny access to a Falklands passenger and cargo ship, which now may operate only to <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Banks Complain That FDIC Name Being `Filched' by S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commercial bankers who successfully kept their deposit insurance fund away from failed savings and loans are taking their next cue from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>. `` He who steals my purse, steals trash ... but he that filches from me my good name ... makes me poor indeed,'' goes the line from `` Othello.'' The bankers say the S & amp; Ls are engaged in a `` sneaky scheme'' to appropriate the name of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, which once exclusively belonged to banks. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grohl </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, is n't worried about the complaints over its letter saying thrift institutions can advertise they are insured by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Bankers are always outraged. It seems to be their eternal state of being,'' <PERSON> Grohl </PERSON> said. `` Personally, I think they're making a mountain out of a molehill here.'' Legislation signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Aug. 9 reorganizes the deposit insurance bureaucracy. Under the old system, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> guaranteed accounts in commercial banks while the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- backed thrift deposits. Each type of institution displayed the initials of their insurance fund in a logo on their door, reassuring each depositor their money is insured to $ 100,000. The new law disbanded the <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, which was out of money anyway, and gave the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits. Now, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> manages two funds _ the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> BIF </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, or SAIF _ much as a household may have two checking accounts. But bankers, despite their own troubles with failures during the 1980s in farm and oil-producing states, were proud of their logo and did n't want to see it associated with S & amp; Ls. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed that banks could keep their <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> logo. And, along with billions of dollars in taxpayers' money, S & amp; Ls would get a new logo with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> eagle and a message, `` Deposits federally insured to $ 100,000. Backed by the full faith and credit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Government.'' Banks thought they had won the battle, but now they're feeling snookered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. On the very day <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the S & amp; L law, the league sent a letter to its members saying that although they could not use the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> logo they could advertise themselves as `` FDIC insured'' or `` insured by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Bankers went ballistic. The <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> headlined its weekly newsletter, `` Thrifts Try To Rustle Banks' FDIC Brand.'' `` We've fought this one before and won. What the league is doing is a sneaky scheme to get what the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> explicitly denied them,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogilvie </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> urging the agency not to `` devalue the 50 years of sterling reputation garnered by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>.'' Regulators, bankers argued, must forbid S & amp; Ls from referring to any government agency as their insurer. But <PERSON> Grohl </PERSON> said such a ruling would raise a constitutional question under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. After all, how can the government prohibit a financial institution from making a simple statement of fact? There is a serious issue behind the rhetoric. Savings and loans lost billions of dollars in deposits earlier this year as bad news mounted about their industry. Even rock-solid institutions had problems calming their customers. Bankers do n't want the public to even slightly confuse their institutions with an S & amp; <ORGANIZATION> L. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls counter that `` full faith and credit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government'' means just what it says for both insurance funds. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> just proved that by spending taxpayers' money to protect S & amp; L depositors, they say. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, said the agency's lawyers had made a preliminary determination it's legal for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to describe themselves as `` FDIC insured. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> board will take the bankers' objections under advisement, he said.

<HEAD>Veteran Counterfeiter Forges Pass From Custody</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A counterfeiter who has spent about 30 of the past 50 years behind bars walked away from a court-ordered supervised residency by forging a pass to a hospital, federal officials said today. <PERSON> William </PERSON> `` Pops'' <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>, 67, had been arrested in July on federal counterfeiting charges and was sent to the pre-trial custody program at the downtown Volunteers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of his age and poor health, deputy <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinett </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON> apparently forged a pass to <ORGANIZATION> Wishard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, signing a counselor's name authorizing him to leave the residency. `` He left about six o'clock in the morning. That was the last time he was seen,'' <PERSON> Robinett </PERSON> said. `` I think it would be safe to call him a career criminal,'' <PERSON> Robinett </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>' first contact with law enforcement dates back to 1939. He probably has at least 45 different arrests. And that's that I know of.'' Most of those offenses were for forgery, impersonating federal officers, writing bad checks and counterfeiting. `` The longest time he's ever gone without being arrested is eight years. But that's because he was in federal prison. Other than that, he's never been out on the street more than four years at a time. He's probably been in jail 30 years out of the last 50,'' <PERSON> Robinett </PERSON> said. A nationwide alert has been issued. `` We've arrested him three times for counterfeiting,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yonkus </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> here. `` Hopefully, he'll be locked up soon.'' <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON> was arrested in July after <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents allegedly caught him making counterfeit $ 100 bills on a printing press in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>. Despite his age and poor health, prosecutors had asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Endsley </PERSON> to order <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON> to remain in jail pending trial. <PERSON> Endsley </PERSON> disagreed and sent <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON> to the less secure Volunteers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> facility.

<TEXT>
 Residents of the Soviet Baltic republics are encouraged by neighboring <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s bold steps away from communism as they probe the limits of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. As more than a million Baltic residents formed a human chain this week to mourn the independence they lost to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s tanks a half-century ago, a poster was displayed in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> capital: `` Lithuanians and Poles: Let's Unite Against the Common Enemy.'' It was not clear whether the message was directed at Poles living in their homeland or the Polish minority in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, but there was little doubt about the `` common enemy'': Soviet-style communism. The message tried to cuts across the border formed by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s incorporation of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> in 1940 to emphasize <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s location twice as far <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, and five centuries of history when the two lands were united in one <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity trade union capped its nine-year reform battle with the election Thursday of one its leaders as prime minister, the first non-Communist in that post in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. On the previous day in the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>, residents held hands to mark the 50th anniversary of a secret Nazi-Soviet agreement that gave <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on the eve of World War II. Although Baltic activists stress there are many differences between their campaign and that of Solidarity, they say the group's experience is valuable <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, president of the Lithuanian grassroots independence movement <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that Solidarity's accomplishments were important `` for all democratic forces in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, like the movement in 1968 in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' So far, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s reaction to the formation of a non-communist government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been calm, taking the line that it is the country's internal affair and offering to work with the new prime minister. The response to the Baltic movement has been harsh words against calls for independence but overall an unprecedented level of tolerance and even sympathy to their demands for at least economic autonomy. Some Baltic residents, especially the elderly who saw troops roll in 1940 to impose Soviet rule, fear the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> will again send in tanks and troops, as it did in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in 1956 and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> 12 years later, to crush the Baltic democratic movement. But others point to Solidarity's victory as proof that force will not work. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sookruus </PERSON>, deputy propaganda chief of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s imposition of martial law in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in December 1981 backfired. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> finally faced bigger problems than it had originally. In that sense, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> served as an example,'' <PERSON> Sookruss </PERSON> told a news conference in the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>. `` The Polish <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was willing to give up its monopoly on power.'' <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, a Solidarity official who in a sign of the group's improved standing has become a Polish senator, traveled to <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> to join in last week's ceremonies In an interview in the <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> offices, he agreed the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> would be unlikely to repeat the mistake and forcibly put down the Baltic independence drive. `` We could n't be destroyed even if we were in prison. The symbols, ethos -LRB- of Solidarity -RRB- are very important in the socialist bloc. This was all preserved despite the imposition of martial law in December 1981,'' said <PERSON> Romaszewski </PERSON>, sporting a red Solidarity pin on his lapel. Solidarity proved that `` it is possible to organize an anti-totalitarian movement,'' he said. The senator said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform effort and worsening economic conditions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are forcing Communist leaders to realize they must put up with opposition groups and democracy, and that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> must allow <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> to settle their problems without interference. While they reject <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> meddling, activists on both sides welcome cooperation between the democratic movements. <PERSON> Algis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cekuolis </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> ruling council, said Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has promised to travel to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> this fall to try to help <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION> persuade the republic's Polish minority to join the group in fighting for independence. Poles, representing about 8 percent of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>'s population, are more aligned with Russians than Lithuanians and have formed a political group, <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, to fight for their own rights. So far, the Poles are concerned about <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>' Lithuanian nationalism. But while they see a future of cooperation, many Lithuanians say they and the Poles are too different to copy each other's tactics. `` Everybody has their own way,'' said <PERSON> Raimonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaminskiene </PERSON>, an English teacher interviewed at a pro-independence rally in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>. `` We are not so quick in our character. We are more northern, more Scandinavian. We always have to think what we are doing.'' She then quoted a <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> saying about sewing, similar to one in Russian, to underscore the point. `` You have to think nine times, and the 10th you have to cut.''

 Muffled drumbeats should be the loudest sound Saturday when the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> recreates in the capital the `` Silent March,'' a civil rights protest in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> 72 years ago. The protest will focus on `` the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and its recent hostile decisions'' diluting affirmative action and minority set-aside programs, said <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> executive director <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON>. The 1917 demonstration, in which 8,000 people led by W.E.B. <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> paraded in silence down Fifth Avenue, protested segregation laws and lynchings in the South. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> march, also led by six drummers playing on muffled instruments, is designed to duplicate the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> march in tone and style if not in crowd size.

<TEXT>
 Four years ago, <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> was excluded from a diplomats' golf tournament she was holding because the <ORGANIZATION> Koganei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, bastion of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s power circles, did n't admit women. The fact that she was vice minister of foreign affairs at the time made no difference. Neither would her appointment on Friday to the highest government post ever attained by a woman, chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Although the country club still is closed to women in this male-dominated society, the scandals that have plagued the governing party have created some unprecedented openings for women. Sex and bribery scandals and an unpopular sales have resulted in the resignations of three prime ministers in three months, critically weakening the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that has controlled government for decades. With her new duties, Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, 61, will act as a highly visible spokewoman for new Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> and coordinate the turf battles among <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s fiercely competitive ministries. She will also act as one of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s chief public relations weapons against <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, who also has skyrocketed in popularity amid the scandals involving male politicians. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> tried to link Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> with the popular `` ordinary housewife'' image that helped propel many female opposition candidates into office in last month's election. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> has an experience as a housewife as well as that of a bureaucrat,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said after appointing her. `` I would like her to push forward political reforms from the standpoint of the people.'' Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, the charismatic socialist leader, led a slate of candidates packed with women to a major defeat of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in elections for the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> replaces <PERSON> Tokuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>, 69, who resigned after apologizing for a much-publicized extramarital affair with a bar hostess 43 years his junior. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> himself replaced Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who resigned because of his reported affairs with women. Although seen as a competent and highly intelligent politician, Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> is considered inexperienced. She also is hampered by being a member of the less-powerful upper house, with only two terms' experience and only a small power base in the party. She assumed her first Cabinet post just two weeks ago, when she was appointed head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` The appointment is apparently aimed at bettering the image of the government,'' said <PERSON> Soichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawara </PERSON>, a prominent political critic. `` But I ca n't help thinking the choice was made perhaps a little too hastily and lightly. She may be helpful in some ways, but I am not confident that a politician with such limited experience can handle perhaps the most demanding position in the Cabinet.'' But if she lacks clout, Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> enjoys general respect, and her education and civil service experience matches that of her male colleagues. `` As far as my near 40-year professional experience is concerned, I never felt any handicaps for being a woman,'' she said after her appointment. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> was one of just two women in a class of 686 that graduated in 1950 from the Law Department of prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the breeding ground for Japanese politicians. She entered the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as one of its first female career officers in 1950, and was director general of its Women's and <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> from 1974-80. In 1980, she was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councillors </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Tochigi </LOCATION> prefecture, and in 1985 was appointed parliamentary vice minister for foreign affairs, when her exclusion from the golf club became a minor cause celebre. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, whose official handicap is 26, was never admitted to the club. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> commands greater international skills than many Japanese politicians. She is fluent in English and served as head of the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> delegation to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on the Women's Decade in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> in 1985 She has experience dealing in Japan-U.S. relations and other international problems as chairman of the party's Foreign Affairs Devision and as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs in the upper house. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> is the widow of <PERSON> Kinji </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, a legislator and former transportation minister who died of a heart attack in 1987, and is said to have inherited some of his power base. She has two daughters.

<BYLINE>Lawyer in Hastings Case Goes to Jail for Contempt ^By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Disbarred lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> was jailed Friday for refusing to answer a senator's questions in the impeachment case against federal judge <PERSON> Alcee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. The once-prominent <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> defense lawyer will serve his time at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, according to the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Borders surrendered quietly, going through a back entrance to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courthouse without speaking to reporters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> ordered Borders incarcerated Tuesday after holding the lawyer in civil contempt of court at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s request. Borders can free himself by answering a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> impeachment committee's questions, or he can wait for release until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> votes on impeaching <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, probably not before mid-October. Borders refused to answer 10 questions from Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., about impeachment charges against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, a 52-year-old <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Granted immunity from prosecution for what he might tell the committee, Borders was ordered by the court to testify but refused. He argued that the questions violated his constitutional rights, including the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> is accused of plotting with Borders in 1981 to obtain a $ 150,000 payoff and of lying about it to a jury that acquitted him in 1981. Borders was convicted in a separate trial, disbarred and served 33 months in prison. Despite the acquittal, the House in August 1988 approved 17 articles of impeachment against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, charging him with the payoff conspiracy, perjury and improper disclosure of information obtained from a court-approved wiretap. The committee will produce a report on the evidence against <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then will vote on whether to remove him from the bench. The questions posed by <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> on Tuesday ranged from whether <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> received any payoff money to the alleged relationship between Borders and the late <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> organized crime boss <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Trafficante </PERSON>. Borders replied to each question by citing a statement he made July 27 when he also refused to testify before the committee. The statement said the questions violated his rights. Borders also objected on the grounds that since <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> was the only senator on hand for the session, a quorum of the committee was not present. <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, however, reminded him of a resolution providing that one senator constitutes a quorum for purposes of hearing testimony from Borders.

 Three teen-agers have been charged with defacing the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag, raising constitutional questions in light of the recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on flag-burning, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> official said. The charge stems from a vandalism spree Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> Byrnes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in which two flags were burned, paint was sloshed on floors, books were scattered and fire extinguishers sprayed. Three 13-year-old boys, students at another school, were charged Thursday in Family Court with defacing the flag, entering without breaking, grand larceny and arson. It has been illegal in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> since 1916 to `` publicly mutilate, deface, defile, defy, jeer at, trample upon or cast contempt, either by word or act,'' the American flag. Similar statutes protect the state and <ORGANIZATION> Confederate </ORGANIZATION> flags. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld an individual's right to burn the flag as a form of political expression under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. Police Chief <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON> said Thursday he was aware of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision but said he believed he had to follow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> law as long as it remained on the books. `` If they wo n't prosecute it, they do n't have to,'' he said. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said the state flag-desecration law should now be considered unconstitutional. The suspects `` ought to be prosecuted under property crime law,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. `` They were n't desecrating the flag, they were destroying other people's property.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether to argue that the charge in this case is inappropriate under the state desecration statute. Solicitor <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gossett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said he would have to examine the case further before deciding whether to prosecute.

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Twelve railroad workers have sued <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, alleging that passenger trains have dumped raw sewage on them while they repaired a bridge. The workers claim in the lawsuit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> this week, that they have been sprayed repeatedly by raw sewage since 1987 while working on a Portland-area railroad bridge over the <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. They say they have suffered flulike symptoms from exposure to human waste and have `` extreme concern'' about working at that site.

<HEAD>Taiwan, U.S. Agree To Fishing Pact In North Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today signed an agreement to regulate Taiwanese fishing in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> by placing transmitters aboard ships, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The pact, a copy of which was made available to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is aimed at high-seas salmon poaching by Taiwanese driftnet vessels. The agreement calls for transmitters that will fix the location of Taiwanese fishing vessels to be placed on board by 1990 and allows enforcement officers to board the vessels. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> fishermen of using driftnets to deplete the North Pacific of its rich marine resources, especially the anadromous species of salmon that spawn in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Both <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ban salmon fishing in the region. Conservationists have criticized the miles-long driftnets for their `` incidental'' catches of thousands of sea birds, seals and other animals. `` We hope this will reduce salmon poaching,'' <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellice </PERSON>, executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, said from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office. `` <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s are not the only boats out there. We hope this would be a model for the Koreans and others,'' <PERSON> Ellice </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> earlier reached a driftnet agreement with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but is still attempting to reach an agreement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` Tough negotiating pays off,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>. `` I believe signing this agreement lays the cornerstone for an overall effort to secure our fisheries and protect a most vital resource.'' The tentative agreement was signed Thursday by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Laux </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Mou-shih </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Diplomatic letters to finalize the agreement were signed today. Enforcement of the agreement will fall to the institute, which is the unofficial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. The institute's enforcement will use <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees under contract to the institute, <PERSON> Ellice </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-hsien </PERSON>, chairman of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, said the agreement was not an ideal pact for local fishermen but it was acceptable for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.

The bad luck with his boat follows even worse luck with rod and reel. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has yet to catch a fish despite going out daily since he arrived at his summer home more than a week ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday blamed his bad luck on the commotion in the water caused by the fleet of seven or eight boats, many of them chartered by news organizations, that follow him. Friday's fishing trip was to be the first under an informal agreeement under which the chase boats were to keep farther away, at least while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was fishing. `` I'll try any technique that works,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday.

<HEAD>Hopkins Researchers Say Second Drug May Help Cut Cost of AZT</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The anti-AIDS drug AZT apparently stays in the body longer when combined with a drug commonly used to treat gout, allowing patients to use less of it, researchers said Friday. If further tests continue to show the combination of AZT and the drug probenecid is safe and effective, AIDS patients may be able to significantly reduce AZT dosages, said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON>, assistant professor of medicine at <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' Division of Clinical Phamacology. <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON> said the combination therapy could lead to a major reduction in the skyrocketing cost of AIDS treatment. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allergy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Infectious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that AZT delays the progession of AIDS in some HIV-infected people who have not developed AIDS symptoms, a group estimated at up to 630,000 nationwide. At the current cost of up to $ 8,000 annually per patient for AZT, also known as azidothymidine, treating this group with the drug could reach more than $ 5 billion yearly. <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON> said that cost could be cut in half with the combination therapy. The Hopkins study, conducted during the first six months of 1988, was published in Friday's edition of the British medical journal <ORGANIZATION> Lancet </ORGANIZATION>. `` At this time, we're not saying that everyone should go out and use probenecid,'' <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON> said. `` This is an important first step, but we must continue with careful study before this therapy is widely adopted. `` I think we should proceed to see if the combination works as well as AZT alone because it would make it a therapy less expensive for patients and less expensive for the country,'' <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON> added. Probenecid apparently works by slowing the combination of flucuronic acid, a sugar derivative, with AZT. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> researchers gave the AZT-probenecid combination to eight men with either AIDS or AIDS-related complex for three days and then measured AZT concentrations in the blood. They found that levels of AZT were nearly doubled by adding probenecid so that patients might be able to take the drug once every eight hours instead of the usual four hours. A second, month-long trial of eight to 10 people less ill than those in the initial study is expected to begin within the next two weeks. `` We'll be studying this group to see how well they tolerate the combination over a longer period of time, while looking for signs of toxicity, which we do n't anticipate,'' <PERSON> Kornhauser </PERSON> said. He said the next step would be a trial involving at least 1,000 AIDS patients to compare the use of AZT alone with the combination treatment.

 Voyager 2 plunged over <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s north pole and today took its closest look at the moon <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, discovering dormant ice-spewing volcanoes and snapping photos of cliffs, faults and glacier-like lunar terrain as the spacecraft capped its epic exploration of four planets. `` This is it _ we are exploring new worlds!'' laboratory astronomer <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON> said after the 12-year-old spaceship made its historic rendezvous with the outermost planet. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> `` is not a gee-whiz, science-fiction, special effects movie. It's a real place.'' The one-ton Voyager probe skimmed 3,048 miles above <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s icy north pole cloud tops at 8:56 p.m. PDT Thursday _ the closest of its planetary encounters _ after being accelerated by <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s gravity to a speed of 61,148 mph. Its photos of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> revealed that <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s major moon has large, inactive volcanic craters, called calderas, `` filled with ice instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock,'' said Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. `` It's the first time we've seen an icy volcano,'' although volcanic ice flows without associated craters were detected on a moon of Uranus, <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said. `` This is a real volcano.'' `` We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> space technology,'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said today in a speech to hundreds of scientists and dignitaries at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Reiterating President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s July statement in support of an eventual permanent base on the Earth's moon and a manned trip to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> declared: `` We Americans have been opening new frontiers throughout our history and we will continue to do so. Today, space is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s frontier.'' <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, an associate administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, called the climax of the Voyager mission historic because `` it's the last time we're seeing a planet for the first time. We've completed the reconnaissance of the planets, except Pluto.'' Five hours after the rendezvous with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, the spaceship made its closest pass by the moon <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> at 2:10 a.m., a flyby that was confirmed when signals reached Earth at 6:16 a.m. PDT. The four hour and six minute delay is the time it takes Voyager's radio signal to travel the 2.75 billion miles to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> The array of information on <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s largest moon had scientists, if anything, more excited than they were about <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> itself. `` <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> will upstage <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. It's filled with hummocky, rippling terrain,'' <PERSON> Terrile </PERSON> said. `` It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the place,'' said <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. The faults suggest that `` Triton quakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon. Later, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> geologist, said there was `` abundant evidence of ice volcanism'' in the latest pictures. He referred to volcanoes that once spewed frozen natural gas or other ice-like substance rather than molten rock. Voyager's newest photos of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> received this morning showed a smooth feature, looking somewhat like a dry lakebed, that <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said measured several hundred miles across. `` It looked like it could be a ... crater of a volcano itself,'' <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said. `` It looks like some sort of feature flooded by material, and the material is probably volcanic material.'' The Voyager mission found similar evidence of icy volcanic flows on Uranus' moon Ariel in 1986, and earlier found active sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io, a moon of Jupiter. <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> emphasized there is no evidence yet that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s icy volcanism is currently active, but said the smooth floor of the crater, unmarked by meteorite impact craters, indicates that the ice volcano may have been active within the last million years or so. Earlier, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, head of Voyager's photographic imaging team at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, had described <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s surface in photos taken Thursday as `` extremely strange and puzzling. The photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying cliffs and `` ice structures of various sorts, like glacier terrain,'' scientist <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. While difficult to interpret, the early photos of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> gave `` the same impression as if you stepped out onto some strange and alien surface,'' with what appears to be a blue, pink and white topography that is `` closer to flat than big mountains,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who called the pictures `` Just short of spectacular.'' At 11:59 p.m. PDT, signals were received showing that Voyager had been bombarded by dust particles up to 100 times a second as it passed through the plane containing <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s rings, said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurnett </PERSON>. The particles, each about a millionth of a yard across _ the size of the particles in cigarette smoke _ did not damage the spacecraft, <PERSON> Gurnett </PERSON> said. Voyager's safe progress through the ring plane prompted scientists to toast each other with champagne even before the spaceship's near encounter with <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` There's certainly euphoria,'' he said. `` We are all very excited.'' Scientists announced Thursday that Voyager discovered two more tiny moons orbiting the solar system's fourth-largest planet: a 60-mile-wide moon designated 1989 N5, and the even smaller 1989 N6, which is a mere 30 miles wide. That brought the number of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s moons discovered before the close encounter to eight, including the two moons detected from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Nereid </LOCATION> _ and four found earlier by <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>. Voyager also found a complete ring of debris encircling <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, although it was at first thought to be a partial ring or ring arc. Voyager photos also indicated a ring arc orbiting farther from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> almost certainly also is a complete ring. During its flight past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON> was programmed to shoot radio waves through the atmospheres of both worlds to study their atmospheres; measure changes in distant starlight to study the rings and search for others; and take its best but still 2.9-million-mile-distant pictures of Nereid. Voyager's hectic schedule also included numerous measurements of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s atmosphere in an effort to understand its 400-mph winds, high-altitude clouds, and its Earth-sized Great Dark Spot and other cyclones. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> calculated Voyager's position during the <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> flyby as nearly 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. But the ship had traveled a curving path totaling 4.43 billion miles since it was launched in 1977, and explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Champagne flowed at the laboratory Thursday when Voyager crossed the supersonic shock wave where the solar wind meets <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s magnetic field Earlier pictures of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> suggested the backward-orbiting moon had meteorite impact craters and possibly glaciers of frozen natural gas on its pink-and-blue surface. Using occasional trajectory corrections and engineering wizardry to aim a space probe built with 1960s technology, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineers said Thursday they got Voyager to within 20 miles of where it was supposed to be after the long journey. `` Not bad shooting,'' said one engineer. Voyager 1 visited Jupiter in 1979 and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980, and now is speeding toward interstellar space _ just as <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 2 will do after it stops studying <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> on Oct. 2. <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION>'s elliptical orbit means it now is closer, making <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> temporarily the solar system's outmost planet `` Someday there ought to be a <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION> flyby,'' <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON> said. `` But there are no active plans to do that.''

 A judge Friday imposed 15 years of probation on a cocaine-addicted mother convicted of delivering drugs to two of her children at birth. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 23, faced a 30-year prison sentence on the conviction under a law usually applied to criminals engaged in illegal drug transactions. `` I do n't have any desire to hurt you. ... I'm not here to put you in prison,'' Circuit Judge O.H. <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> told Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> before handing down the sentence, which includes at least one year in a residential drug-treatment program she is now attending. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is believed to be the first mother in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ and one of only a few in the country _ convicted of providing drugs to their newborns under a criminal drug-dealing law. In a non-jury trial last month, <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON> determined that Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had delivered cocaine to her babies through their umbilical cords. He acquitted her of a child-abuse count. The children _ a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in January _ are cared for by relatives and are described as in in good health. But scientists have said that cocaine can cause neurological problems, premature birth and even death in newborns. Justifying the conviction under the statute which prohibits `` delivery'' of an illegal substance from one person to another, the judge ruled that `` a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has not -LRB- yet -RRB- been severed is a person'' within <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law. Other terms of the lengthy probation period included one year of strict supervision by probation officers during the rehabilitation program, random drug testing at least once a month for a year, educational and vocational training, an intense prenatal program if she should become pregnant again and 200 hours of community service. Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a slim, bespectacled woman with a ready smile, declined the judge's invitation to speak about her problem. But in response to the judge's question as to whether she believed she was getting some benefit from the drug-treatment program, she said, `` Yes sir, I just feel a lot of pressure.'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Deen </PERSON>, who said the case would set a precedent in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, had recommended strict compliance with the drug-treatment program and lengthy probation. He had called it `` a child-abuse case, not a drug case.'' `` We want to send a message not of fear, but of hope'' to drug-addicted mothers to take care of their problems, <PERSON> Deen </PERSON> told the judge. `` She's used up all her chances,'' the prosecutor said. `` We need to ensure that this woman does not give birth to another cocaine baby. ... The message is that this community can not afford to have two or three cocaine babies from the same person. Defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON>, who is appealing the conviction, maintained again that his client should not have been tried under the drug-delivery statute. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> intended the law for drug traffickers, not mothers and children. `` Giving birth to a child, we do not think this is a 30-year felony. ... This is not a criminal issue,'' <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> said after the sentencing. `` The Legislature has been usurped, overridden by this court and this prosecution.'' In explaining his verdict issued last month, the judge said he considered the two children to be the victims because they `` had no ability to control what was being introduced into their bodies.'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was acquitted by the judge of one count of child abuse. But other mothers giving birth to cocaine babies have been successfully prosecuted under that law, which carries a maximum of five years in prison.

<HEAD>States Say FEC Computer Election Standards Costly, Time-Consuming</HEAD>

 State election officials said Friday they face financial and other obstacles in trying to implement voluntary federal guidelines for computerized voting systems. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> standards, intended to guide state authorities who oversee elections, are aimed at assuring that the computerized systems used in many states are accurate and fraud-free. But a draft proposal has come under criticism from some public interest groups. The state election officials voiced their concerns at a meeting of the 20-member advisory panel of the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearinghouse </ORGANIZATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelson </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION>, said he expects that implementing the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> standards will require `` very arduous'' efforts. `` I anticipate it's going to be a very difficult task in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, and a time-consuming one,'' he said. Dot <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> election official, said her state's legislature last January passed legislation largely modeled after the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> standards, which have been in the drafting stage for several years, but provided no money for carrying it out Since then, she said, `` We've just been really scratching our heads, picking people's brains. ... We've been operating with no funds to put our standards in place.'' <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s chief of elections and political reform, said election authorities in her state also lack enough money to implement the computerized voting system standards. `` We will need funds ... to help us adopt that part of the standards which involves the certification process'' for computer equipment and software, she said. <PERSON> Penelope </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonsall </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> clearinghouse, told the meeting the commission aims to make a final decision on the standards by late October. She said that a 30-day period for submitting public comments on the standards will run through Sept. 8. Public interest groups criticizing the draft standards include Election Watch, a project of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The first major inadequacy is that they're not mandatory,'' said <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON>, director of Election Watch. `` The second is that there ... was virtually no sign of any public input into their creation.'' There has been increased concern in recent years over the accuracy and security of computerized tabulation systems, which in 1988 were used in handling more than 50 percent of all voters' ballots nationwide `` The election community is underfunded and underorganized,'' according to <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, a computer science professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` With some exceptions, it knows little about managing computer security. Few jurisdictions share knowledge. Therefore, American elections are more vulnerable to fraud and error than is desirable or necessary.'' The proposed <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> standards outline in technical language the steps that should be followed by election authorities to operate a reliable voting system. The latest draft was released Aug. 8. The standards are to be voluntary because by law, states control their own election systems. Computerized voting systems include those using punchcards; marksense cards, in which a person marks his choice in pencil on cards that are read by computer; and direct-recording electronic systems, in which the voter pushes a button.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s best-known dissident, said Friday his indictment under the national security laws was an act of persecution intended to discredit his opposition political party. Radical students shouting slogans against the government and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> battled riot police with rocks and firebombs in the worst campus violence for several months. The protests were not inspired by the action against <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, but were directed at the laws under which he was charged. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> leads the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition group in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. He said the charges were fabricated and declared to followers: `` I have nothing to fear. I will squarely face trial.'' Prosecutors charged in the indictments, presented earlier Friday, that <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and two legislators from his party failed to report <PERSON> National </PERSON> <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyung-won </PERSON>'s secret trip to <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last year. The three opposition figures were not jailed pending trial. National security laws forbid unauthorized travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has defined as an enemy country since the peninsula was divided in 1945. The two Koreas fought a war in 1950-53, but no peace treaty has been signed. If convicted, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, party floor leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Won-ki </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chul-yong </PERSON> could be sentenced to prison terms of up to five years. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said prosecutors knew they could not win the case, so the three might never be tried. Aides said the government could influence the judiciary to delay proceedings indefinitely. Legal experts said the trial of <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, the man who made the trip, should be finished within six months. It is to begin in September. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> was arrested June 28 on charges of espionage, violating a ban on unauthorized travel to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and receiving $ 120,000 from North Korean agents before and during the trip to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> in August 1988. Prosecutors said they had evidence that <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> knew about <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s trip two months before it was made public in June. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has said he did not learn of the trip until shortly before <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> turned himself in to authorities in late June. The 64-year-old opposition leader also was charged with violating the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Currency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> by receiving $ 10,000 from <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> apparently did not know the money was from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, so the only charge was failing to report it. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who ran for president in 1971 and 1987, has denied having anything to do with <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> or his alleged espionage. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON>, 52, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in April 1988. He was expelled from <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s party after his trip was made public. Fighting was reported at two <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> universities after police blocked attempts by 1,400 students to march into the streets after campus rallies. No injuries were reported. A main theme of the protests was the arrest of a radical woman student who returned home across the land border at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce village Aug. 15 from an illegal trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Im Su-kyong visited the North in late June to attend a world youth festival July 1-8. She said her trip was a symbolic gesture for reunification. At <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, about 400 students fought police with firebombs and rocks for two hours before police drove them back to the campus with tear gas. The students demanded the release of Miss Im and repeal of the national security laws. They also demanded withdrawal of the 43,000 American soldiers stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, about 800 riot police firing tear gas from two armored vans blocked 1,000 students from leaving campus. The students at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> National did not use firebombs.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bade farewell to the visiting prime minister of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> today, then hit a snag in his vacation when his speedboat became became snarled in a line and was disabled. The summer White House, meanwhile, prepared to turn its attention later in the day to a package of new assistance for combating drugs in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. Officials said details of the $ 2.5 million aid package would be announced here later today. Asked whether he would send helicopters or other equipment to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> fight the drug lords, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` We're working on the problem. There's a lot going on on that front ... We're working to accommodate President -LRB- <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> -RRB- Barco ... We're working now with his people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> escorted his house guests, Danish Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, to the helicopter pad on his 11-acre vacation compound here. The Schlueters, who are on their honeymoon, arrived Thursday and were traveling to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> after leaving <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday that he and <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>, whom he first met at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s, would discuss `` fascinating changes'' in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the international war on narcotics, the two first families spent much of their time boating and fishing. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked by reporters about apparently dimmed prospects that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will step down as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military ruler, shrugged his shoulders and said, `` We just keep on going.'' He had no other coments as he waved a farewell to his guests. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then went out for a fishing trip, taking two reporters along, but returned to the dock after only a few minutes. The president's boat, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to have run over a lobster trap line and one of its two propellers was disabled. Despite efforts by a underwater frogman to unsnarl the line, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his party left the boat and it was taken to a local marina for repairs. On Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> voiced praise for the new Solidarity-led government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, complimenting both the old and the new regimes in a carefully worded statement. That day, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> became the first Soviet-bloc nation to have a non-communist-led government. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the statement that Poles `` will have our continued support as they meet the serious economic and political challenges before them.'' He congratulated the new Polish prime minister, former Solidarity activist <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowieck </PERSON>. `` I also salute President -LRB- <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> for his political wisdom in endorsing a government reflecting the genuine will of the Polish people and Solidarity, under the leadership of <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, for its constructive role in helping bring about a new beginning in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' the president said. `` These developments hold promise not only for a peaceful democratic transition in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but also for a broader process of European reconcilation, toward a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free.'' The vacation White House, meanwhile, had little to say on new violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said was being closely monitored. Authorities in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> said drug traffickers Thursday bombed the headquarters of two political parties and set fire to two politicians' homes, killing one person. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has yet to catch a fish despite daily fishing outings in his power boat, was presented a 5-pound haddock by a local fisherman as the president gave the Danish couple a boat tour of the <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> waterfront. `` He gave it to me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told onlookers, showing the fish. `` It's the only way I can get them.''

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Friday urged warring Angolan factions to reach a cease-fire to end the outbreak of violence in the civil war there. `` In order for there to be an effective cease-fire, there must be a comprehensive cease-fire agreement. Such an agreement would be in the interest of both sides,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> on Thursday renounced a truce that began in June. The agreement between <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> was designed to end the 14-year civil war. The truce began collapsing the week after it began. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> on Friday said 77 government troops and six of its rebels were killed in heavy fighting this week.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will sit out next week's close of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> peace conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> because of the lack of progress on a truce and power-sharing arrangement, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. Accusing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and its surrogate government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> of inflexibility, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said `` Secretary <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> does not plan at this time to return to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for the August 28th to 30th ministerial session.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> took part in the opening round of the talks that seek an agreement between the Cambodian government and a rebel coalition backed by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> once <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdraws the last of its troops next month. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said there had been too little pogress on the central sticking point of the talks _ who would take part in a transitional government that will rule <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> until free elections can be arranged. `` Prince <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has demonstrated admirable flexibility in attempting to resolve this key power-sharing problem,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, his reasonable attitude has not been reciprocated by <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> regime. At this point, therefore, a comprehensive settlement is not in sight.'' The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> conference, under the sponsorship of 19 countries and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, sent a fact-finding <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to gather information for establishment of a peacekeeping force that would oversee the withdrawal of the estimated 26,000 Vietnamese troops and implementation of a cease-fire. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> to head an interim government. But Cambodian leader <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> rejects any participation by <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>'s main coalition partner, the China-backed <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> The communist faction ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in the 1970s and is believed to have killed more than 1 million people before being forced out by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1978. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> has offered the working groups in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> several formulas for power-sharing, while <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> has failed to concede any role for <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> except at the head of a commission to oversee elections. <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> believes that if the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> are left out of an interim government they will fight and endanger chances for peace, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. But he is also thought to believe that a new Cambodian government can eventually split the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> by weeding out and removing the most dangerous elements within the faction.

<TEXT>
 The Office of Surface Mining, under fire in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for allowing strip mining in a southern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> national forest, said Friday it was suspending the mining company's permit pending further study. The agency's new director, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, suspended the ruling that cleared the way for <ORGANIZATION> Belville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to apply for state mining permits on government-protected land in the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. `` The entire matter is on hold,'' said <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who wants the paperwork refiled and the procedures leading up the controversial decision repeated. `` The critical issue is making sure fair and open procedures are followed in reaching a decision,'' he said in a prepared statement. In a letter to the coal company, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes mining in the southern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> forest, <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> said `` indications exist that <ORGANIZATION> OSM </ORGANIZATION> may not have followed its own internal procedures.'' That same charge was leveled in June by Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. Va.. Investigators for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> mining subcommittee, which <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> heads, concluded the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency failed to get independent documentation and skimpily reviewed company documents before deciding <LOCATION> Belville </LOCATION> had a valid right to mine for coal in the <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> asked the agency to freeze action on all pending coal rights claims until the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> finishes the lengthy process of putting a federal standard in place. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> did n't respond to that request, and the decision he announced Friday applied only to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> case. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said his action came as a result of his review of the overall issue of mining rights on protected land, and stressed that it does n't necessarily mean the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> ruling will be changed. In a reversal of a 1986 decision, <LOCATION> Ironton </LOCATION>, Ohio-based <ORGANIZATION> Belville </ORGANIZATION> in December received a crucial bureaucratic approval saying it had the right to strip mine for coal on 5,440 acres of the national forest. So far the company has applied for state mining permits covering about 180 of those acres, but the permits had not been yet been issued. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> owns surface rights and manages the 190,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and vigorously opposes <LOCATION> Belville </LOCATION>'s proposal It argues that the federal government should have followed state standards since there's no federal standard to apply when companies buy previous owners' mineral rights and seek to mine on government-protected land. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also claimed the mineral rights <LOCATION> Belville </LOCATION> bought in 1983 and 1984 do not specify coal mining, but instead cover the strip-mining of fire clay and any coal incidental to the clay-mining. Fire clay is used in brick making.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today authorized a $ 65 million emergency drug-fighting package consisting largely of helicopters, assault boats, small arms and other equipment to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> fight its war against drug lords. Violence by drug gangs `` threatens the very fabric'' of life in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, justifying the immediate aid. `` The recent wave of threats by the drug cartel ... makes it clear it is time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other nations to stand with President -LRB- <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> -RRB- Barco against these insidious forces,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s president had made it clear he would `` welcome <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> material and support.'' The aid to the South American nation includes <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> and Blackhawk helicopters, 18-man assault boats, jeeps, machine guns, grenade launchers, other small arms and medical supplies. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops have been requested by the Colombians, and he added, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complete confidence in the ability of the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> police and military'' to fight the drug cartel. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers would be sent to train the Colombians in use of the equipment, and said he wanted to emphasize `` we do not anticipate that they would be in a combat role.'' The $ 65 million will be in addition to $ 2.5 million in security aid aimed at helping the Colombians protect their judges, who have been the principal target for assassination by drug traffickers, according to administration sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there would be additional money for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the anti-drug strategy unveiled by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sept. 5. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the $ 65 million would be drawn from a special fund available to the White House for emergency situations. Some $ 75 million is set aside each year for such situations, about $ 10 million of which has been spent thus far this fiscal year, said another administration official. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the equipment would arrive in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the next week to 14 days. `` The purpose is to get it there fast,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, asked on the golf course today whether he would send helicopters or other equipment to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, said: `` We're working on the problem. There's a lot going on on that front ... We're working to accommodate President -LRB- <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> -RRB- Barco ... We're working now with his people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> strongly urged Americans to avoid travel to <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the headquarters of the drug traffickers' cartel Spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the travel advisory was being issued in light of the violent campaign being waged by the cartel in retaliation for the government crackdown against drug traffickers. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was sending two <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> helicopters to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation today to help police. `` This is an intensive and courageous effort on the part of the Colombians, and one in which we are happy to be supportive. We will be happy to stand with the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government and people as they deal with this problem,'' said <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. `` The thing they really need is transport equipment'' to conduct raids and ferret out the producers of illicit drugs that are shipped to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally, said one source. The apparent declaration of war by drug lords against the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government `` certainly heightens the concern about security, both for the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government and for ourselves,'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said Thursday. The bombing wave `` dramatizes, I would say, what we've long known, and that's that these drug traffickers represent a very concrete threat to the institutions of the government of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. To help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> meet that threat, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is moving ahead on a stalled $ 2 million program to train security personnel for <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> courts that are handling the drug cases. And State Department officials announced they are sending <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> $ 500,000 to `` be used to purchase non-lethal equipment'' including `` armored vehicles, bomb disposal equipment, radio direction finders, personal protection equipment, and forensic lab equipment.'' Colombian Justice Minister <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> was quoted in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> as saying the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> refused to allow the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government to use some of the money to buy armored cars, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials said those remarks apparently were based on a misunderstanding. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Colombian officials were consulting on how to best use the remaining $ 2.5 million appropriated by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to help that country. Administration officials said the latest violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> caused no injuries to Americans or damage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities and that they had no plans to withdraw any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel stationed there. Without such a plan the government would not even necessarily pay for travel of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependents who want to leave, <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said. The mission remained in a heightened state of alert, meaning that the 100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at the embassy in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> and two dozen <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents there kept low profiles, officials said. The bombings followed a drug crackdown inspired by the assassination of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading Colombian presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of drug traffickers. The state of siege allows for quick extraditions of alleged drug traffickers wanted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges. Those extraditions ended abruptly in 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, under pressure from traffickers, overturned the extradition agreement. The traffickers have indicated that extradition is one of their major concerns due to their fears that they would not be able to escape as they have in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.

 Entertainer <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has settled a $ 20 million lawsuit over recording royalties with <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, her lawyer, <PERSON> Aleta </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON>, said Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> ordered details sealed and confidential, at the request of both Miss <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and MCA.

The lawsuit also sought royalties on sales of recordings with other artists as well as close-out and promotional records that included a 25th anniversary album.

 Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said Friday that countries considering harboring drug traffickers who fled their native <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s crackdown should take heed of the violence plaguing that nation. `` I think any nation around the world is certainly going to take notice of the enormous cost that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is paying for letting these criminals proceed to dominate the processes of law,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` I would hope that any country where these individuals seek refuge will respond accordingly.'' But <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he could not confirm reports that some of the drug kingpins had fled to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` As usual, when you're looking for fugitives, there are a number of reported sightings, but I do n't think I could give you anything with authority,'' he said. As for <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> _ the one person arrested in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s nationwide sweep who the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it wants to extradite _ <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the extradition proceedings `` have about been completed.'' `` Our hope is that we will be in a position to deliver over the weekend the necessary documentation to <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> officials,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was indicted in March in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on charges of laundering money for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, reputed to be the largest in the world. While Colombian authorities have said they have arrested other people who are wanted on charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> did not respond when asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was seeking their extradition as well. Other administration officials have said they are unfamiliar with the other people arrested. Although <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and Colombian Minister of Justice <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> had planned to meet this week to discuss extradition procedures, the <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Friday that Ms. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiff </PERSON> remained in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> following an outbreak of bombings and fires in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> allegedly set by drug traffickers who declared `` total war'' on the government. The Colombian <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, under threat from drug traffickers, threw out an extradition treaty in 1987. Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> resumed extraditions last weekend in an emergency action following the assassination of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a leading presidential candidate who strongly opposed the drug trade. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said it was unclear what impact the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> crackdown was having on the flow of cocaine from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` That's hard to say,'' the attorney general said. `` The ultimate dislocation of the cocaine problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is going to come when people quit using cocaine.''

 The mayor prayed on the 50-yard line as 10 protesters blew horns and jeered in one of the first gridiron confrontations over a court ban on invocations at high school athletic events. Mayor <PERSON> Emory </PERSON> <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON>'s prayer ended with six people being escorted out of <LOCATION> Cramton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION> for sounding airhorns. One protester was arrested for struggling as he was led out of the stands. <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> said Friday his actions were justified by the response of the 5,000 fans who attended the high school football game. Most cheered at the end of prayers by <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>. `` I did n't know it was big news. We've been praying at football games for 50 years. I was n't trying to make a point,'' said <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON>, a conservative and former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But a civil libertarian said the Thursday night episode highlighted the difficulty Southerners have dealing with religious diversity and a Jan. 3 ruling by the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The court ruled that prayers before school-sponsored events violate the constitutional principle of separation of church and state. On May 30, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand that decision, which upheld a student's lawsuit to prevent pre-game prayers in <LOCATION> Douglas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The ruling affected only <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, and was largely ignored until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to overturn it. `` I am a Southerner, and traditionally in the South we have been so homogeneous religiously that people are unable to put themselves in the place of the minority,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> law professor <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, a state board member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Whatever the interpretation of the pre-game ceremony, it appears the issue will wind up back in court. <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, state director for the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said a lawsuit over the prayers was `` highly likely.'' `` We're going to fight the charge of harassing police,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, 23, the college student who spent more than an hour in jail following his arrest on that charge at Thursday night's game. Since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, many school systems in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> have expressed displeasure with the ruling while saying they would abide by it. In <LOCATION> Childersburg </LOCATION> on Thursday night, a group of about 100 people led fans in a spontaneous recitation of the Lord's Prayer during a game between B.B. <ORGANIZATION> Comer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Childersburg </LOCATION> High. This week, all across <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, radio stations are broadcasting prayers at 6:55 p.m. _ five minutes before most prep games start _ and are asking fans to take portable radios to the stadiums. Mayor <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON>, however, decided to take it a step further before the season opener between <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> E. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jess </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON>. He walked onto the field, took the public address microphone and led the crowd in prayer. `` We thank you Lord that we do live in a free land, a free land where we can pray,'' said <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON>. `` Bless us now, keep our players safe.'' In the stands, the handful of protesters wore T-shirts scrawled with sayings like `` The Constitution Rules'' and `` Church and State Do n't Mix.'' Police stopped them from unfurling a banner and took the airhorns because both are prohibited in the city-owned stadium, said police Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hankins </PERSON>. The mayor said the arrest of <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> and the ejection of the other protesters was prompted by their use of the ear-splitting horns, not by their opposition to him. <PERSON> Folmar </PERSON> argued his pre-game prayer was legal because he is independent of the school system and the game was played a city-owned stadium that is the site for the home games of all <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> high schools. He said he would pay the legal expenses arising from the defense of any lawsuit over his actions. `` There wo n't be one dime of taxpayers' money spent,'' said the mayor. That was welcome news to <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spears </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which was reponsible for the football game. `` Our position is that we had no control,'' <PERSON> Spears </PERSON> said. `` We had control over the game, but we have no control over the mayor.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> met Friday with emissaries from the superpowers, and Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> called on workers to refrain from strikes to avoid worsening <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s dire economic woes. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> met with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and three Democratic congressmen. He later met with the Soviet ambassador and West German envoys. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said after the meeting with the prime minister that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would consider new ways to aid the country, but would not say whether that included additional financial assistance. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> assumed office on Thursday in a historic transfer of power from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a Solidarity-led coalition, the first government led by non-Communists in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who convinced Communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to approve the Solidarity-led government, said in a statement Friday that <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s selection was the `` breakthrough'' needed to stop <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic decline. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said dramatic changes were needed by the government but called on workers to limit strikes to avoid causing further economic damage. `` In face of so critical an employment situation, radical actions of the government are needed. At the same, we must radically limit economic losses which are an ovbious result of any strike struggle,'' he said in a statement. `` We must save <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> not at the cost of other people but together,'' he said. In a rare show of support that would have been unthinkable only months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Miezcyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, who is on an official visit to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, sent <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> a telegram Friday saying the new prime minister could count on the party's support `` in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis.'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kansas, said <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> told him: `` ` He who helps early, helps twice.' In other words, this is very important now to keep up the momentum and let the Polish people see some change.'' But Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was cautious about offering more financial aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` Obviously, we do have a budget deficit at home,'' she said. `` We will provide aid as we can, when we can, but there is already a very significant program underway.'' She was referring to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 115 million aid offer made during a July visit. Solidarity leaders have been hoping for a $ 10 billion assistance package from Western countries. Later, the Doles met for over an hour with <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said they delivered a letter from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> congratulating him `` on his wisdom and his leadership in this difficult time, this time of transition and the progress that is being made in forming a new government, his cooperation in that process.'' She said a similar letter was delivered to <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. At <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s meeting with Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Brovikov </PERSON>, the ambassador congratulated <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> on his election and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> sent greetings to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, a government spokesman said. <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election has brought reserved support from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said Friday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials were `` happy to hear'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s remarks Thursday about <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> remaining in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> socialist economic alliance `` The sensible and constructive approach by the head of the Polish government to these issues, which have paramount significance for the peoples of the two countries, coincides with our wishes,'' <PERSON> Gremitskikh </PERSON> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would soon send a team of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to study what priorities such aid would take. Referring to unemployment that will result as inefficient industries are closed under economic reform plans, she said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would have to lay `` a safety net for workers as they go through this transition, which obviously is going to produce difficulties.'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> also met <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, all Democrats. The three represent the congressional committee that oversees compliance with the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords on human rights. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> called <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election `` a wager on freedom we can not afford to lose,'' and said he would return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to support increased aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, in his statement, appealed to striking railway workers in the central city of <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION> to stop their protest. `` I turn to <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION> railwaymen to display resolve in stopping the increasingly dangerous strike in the region. A strike action ... now has a character of a provocation aimed against the first prime minister elected at Solidarity's initiative,'' he said. Communist Party First Secretary <PERSON> Miezcyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, who is on an official visit to <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, sent <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> a telegram Friday saying the new prime minister could count on the party's support `` in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis.''

 A man charged with drowning his four children and trying to kill his wife by driving their car into a river `` lived for those kids'' and is innocent, the wife said. `` Right now, I love him with every ounce of my body,'' <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Friday. `` There's no doubt in my mind what happened It was a complete and total accident. I know how hard he tried to stop the car.'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> was arrested Aug. 10 and charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one of attempted murder. The family's car slammed through a barricade and into the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wyandotte </LOCATION> on Aug. 3, killing their children, <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, 8, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, 4, <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON>, 2, and <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, 8 months. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> and his wife escaped and passing boaters rescued them. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, 28, initially said a leg cramp caused him to jam down the gas pedal and careen into the river. But police said he later admitted that, distraught over deep debts, he deliberately plunged the car into the river. Mrs. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON>, 32, told the News she thought police coerced her husband into making the admission. `` They were using every technique in the book on him and he cracked,'' she said in an interview from a relative's home in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` He lived for those kids.

That's all I ever wanted was children,'' Mrs. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> said She also said she fears testifying at her husband's preliminary hearing, scheduled for Thursday. `` I do n't want them to manipulate me. I do n't want to be the one who locks him away for the rest of his life for something they mistook and turned around,'' she said. <PERSON> DeLisle </PERSON> remains in the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> without bond, and his wife said he is confused and depressed. `` He thinks I blame him, which I do n't,'' she said. `` It could have been me who was driving.

 The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm exports is recovering much faster than was expected a few months ago and this year may be close to the record set in the early 1980s, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. As it looks now, commodity exports will be worth $ 40 billion in the fiscal year that will end on Sept. 30, up 12 percent from $ 35.3 billion in the previous year. The new forecast, up $ 1 billion from the previous estimate in May, would be less than 9 percent below the record $ 43.8 billion in 1981. The department attributed much of the gain of 1988 over 1987 to `` improved prospects for exports of cotton, red meats and horticultural products'' and said larger shipments of rice, seeds, feed grains and grain products also are expected. But all of the export value increase for 1989 over 1988 is due to higher prices. The report said the actual volume of shipments is expected to be 147 million metric tons, down from 148.3 million tons last year. The tonnage for 1989 is nearly 10 percent below the 162.3 million tons exported in 1981. `` Preliminary estimates for fiscal 1990 -LRB- the year beginning Oct. 1 -RRB- point to a decline in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports due to reduced volume and prices for most bulk commodities,'' the report said. No 1990 estimates were issued. After rising annually for many years to 1981, exports began a general slide, reaching a decade low of $ 26.3 billion in 1986. World economic problems and competition from foreign suppliers were major reasons. The recovery has been accompanied by rising commodity prices and a tightening of global grain supplies, including sharply lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inventories because of last year's drought and short crops. Shipments of grains and grain products head the 1989 list at an estimated $ 17 billion, up from $ 12.7 billion in 1988. That included corn, $ 6.5 billion, up from $ 4.33 billion, and wheat and flour, $ 6.1 billion, up from 4.64 billion. Soybean exports were valued at $ 4.1 billion this year, down from about $ 5 billion in 1988. Exports of livestock and livestock products were forecast at $ 5.4 billion, up from $ 4.9 billion last year; horticultural products, $ 4.3 billion, up from $ 3.82 billion. Cotton exports were estimated at $ 2.2 billion, up slightly from $ 2.14 billion in 1988; and tobacco, $ 1.3 billion, about the same as last year.

 The National Gallery of Art recently bought its first work by French artist <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Picabia </PERSON>, titled `` Machine Turn Quickly,'' and will put the modernistic image on display Sunday as part of a long-term exhibition on 20th century art. <PERSON> Picabia </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchamp </PERSON> and <PERSON> Man </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> were the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> leaders of the so-called dada movement of `` anti-art'' that arose in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> from disillusionment over the events leading to World War I. Dada artists emphasized word play, the absurd and the importance of chance in artistic creation, and often used machine imagery to portray human activity. <PERSON> Picabia </PERSON>'s `` Machine Turn Quickly,'' produced in 1916-18 using gouache and metallic paint, depicts man and woman as gears enmeshed in an endlessly repeating cycle. National Gallery director <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Picabia </PERSON> work, purchased from a dealer, will be displayed with two other dada works from the gallery's permanent collection, <PERSON> Duchamp </PERSON>'s `` The Box in a Valise'' and `` Untitled -LRB- Medici Prince -RRB-'' by <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Astronaut Almost Backed Out of Columbia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUSKEGON, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A month before astronaut <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON> went into space on the shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, he got news that nearly prompted him to back out of the mission: His pregnant wife had breast cancer. `` At first, I thought of asking them to find someone to take my place. I did n't think I should go,'' said <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, one of five crew members on the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which ended a secret five-day flight Aug. 13. `` But <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> is a very strong lady. She would have nothing to do with that,'' the <LOCATION> Muskegon </LOCATION> native told The <ORGANIZATION> Muskegon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> by telephone Thursday from his office at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Instead, <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, due to give birth in December, underwent a radical mastectomy while her husband finished training for his flight. She then started chemotherapy. When her husband launched into space from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, she was there in the crowd to cheer him on. Five days later, when the shuttle landed in the desert at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, she and their five children, ages 1 to 9, were there to greet him. <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, 40, whose only other <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> flight five years ago included a space walk, said he was eager to get back home. `` It did n't affect my job performance or my fascination with space. But ... well, I'm glad we were n't going up for a long time, one of those month-long flights.'' <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON> said he probably would pass up many of the special appearances and speaking engagements that usually follow <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> flights. `` I'm not in a big mood to go traveling right now,'' he said. `` My place is close to home.'' <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>'s previous scheduled space flight, the shuttle that was supposed to track <PERSON> Halley </PERSON>'s Comet in early 1987, was canceled because of the Challenger disaster that killed seven crew members. Just before <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>'s flight this month, his 7-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Katie </PERSON>, asked, `` But what if you do n't come back, <PERSON> Daddy </PERSON>?'' `` I guess I did n't realize how the visions of -LRB- the Challenger flight -RRB- is still in their minds,'' <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON> said. `` She made me think: ` Why am I taking this risk?''' He said he found solace in his answer. `` The risk is part of my job,'' he told her. `` And I do it because I think it's very, very important for the country and the world.''

<HEAD>Soviet Envoy Meets With Christian Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet envoy met Friday with the leader of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Christian forces in an effort to end the deadly war with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, a key Soviet ally. Soviet diplomat <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON>, who later flew to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, described the talks with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as `` useful.'' An <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> spokesman characterized the talks as positive. Also Friday, French radio said vessels from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 6th Fleet were anchored 50 miles off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and that a Soviet missile launcher was heading toward the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> to join other ships already there. The Soviet government denied the report. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, Cmdr. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunden </PERSON> said it was likely the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and another 6th Fleet vessel, the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, both were in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> Friday. But he said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> activity was routine and the nations were not combining forces. Police said at least three people were killed and eight wounded in clashes in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Friday, in which Syrian gunners also launched scores of rockets and mortar rounds at a 28-mile coastal stretch in the Christian heartland. The new casualities brought the overall toll to 794 people killed and 2,222 wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between Christian forces and Moslem-allied Syrian troops. The Syrians, who have 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, control all land exits from the Christian enclave and shell the coastline regularly to prevent resupplies from reaching <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> units of commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The Soviet envoy crossed <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line for separate meetings Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch, <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Sfeir </PERSON>, north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, then with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, in the bunker of the devastated Presidential Palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>. On arrival for the meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON>, who heads the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> department at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, had to abandon his car 500 yards from the palace and walk up a driveway blanketed with debris and glass shards. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has been living in the heavily fortified bunker under the two-story palace for five months while Syrian gunners shell the compound daily. Talking to reporters after his two-hour session at <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> said: `` We have just completed a useful exchange on the situation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The Soviet government, he told reporters, was `` deeply concerned about the suffering of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people, the loss of human life and the material damage.'' `` Of course we view his proposals positively,'' an aide to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said, refusing to give details. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON> earlier met in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who heads a Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> competing for legitimacy with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s government. The Soviet envoy later left for <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s chief Arab ally, although the two countries often differ on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> politics. <PERSON> Tarasov </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> defied <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s rejection of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as the voice of Christians and a negotiating partner. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> had cautioned <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> in 1976 against intervention in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> considers its eastern neighbor within its sphere of influence and vital to its security. <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> sources said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal calls for `` stabilizing the security situation by halting Syrian-Christian clashes.'' One source said it includes reviving the Arab committee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which suspended its mediation effort last month, blaming <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> for the lack of progress. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofeili </PERSON>, a senior official in <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, said the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group was `` in a state of war with the French forces.'' A previously unknown group, calling itself the Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed pledged to `` confront the flagrant French military intervention in the internal <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> affairs.'' The group, in a hand-written statement delivered to a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said its `` mujahideen -LRB- holy fighters -RRB- are ready to carry out God's verdict in striking at Western interests, topped by French interests.'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has said its six ships off <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, led by the aircraft carrier <ORGANIZATION> Foch </ORGANIZATION> with about 2,000 marines aboard, is on a `` humanitarian'' mission to help evacuate the estimated 7,000 French nationals living in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if the situation deteriorates. Moslem leaders accuse <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, who governed <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> until 1943, of favoring Christians in the conflict and that the warships are posted to protect them. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said it was trying to arrange a visit by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> soon, but that it could not yet set a date. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s Moslem allies already have accused the pope of bias toward the Christians.

<HEAD>Violence Reported Involving Minority in Bulgaria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> said Friday that at least 15 people were killed in southern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> in mid-August in clashes involving security forces and members of the 200,000-strong <PERSON> Pomak </PERSON> minority. The state news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said the report was untrue. In many places, soldiers and tanks moved in to quell the unrest, said the diplomats in the Bulgarian capital, who were reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and spoke on condition of anonymity. They reported deaths in <LOCATION> Dobnitsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kornitsa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lozhnitsa </LOCATION> in the Blagoevgrad area and said other casualities occurred in at least a dozen other villages. The actual death toll was likely to be much higher, according to reports reaching the diplomats. They said no report on wounded was available. The diplomats said the <LOCATION> Pomaks </LOCATION>, ethnic Bulgarians of Moslem faith, were protesting government refusal to give them passports to emigrate to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. At least 310,000 ethnic Turks living in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> have received passports and crossed to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> since May, when communist authorities said at least nine ethnic <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> died in clashes with security forces in northern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The diplomats put the number of May deaths at 30 or more. According to the sources, the new disturbances started this month in northeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> near Razgrad and <LOCATION> Varna </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, where anger flared among the Pomaks over the travel ban. In the south, disturbances took place both in <LOCATION> Pomak </LOCATION> and in mixed Pomak-Turkish communities, said the diplomatic sources, who mentioned the villages of <LOCATION> Volko </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Selo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ribnovo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Khostanie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Breznitsa </PERSON>. Unlike the ethnic Turks, <PERSON> Pomaks </PERSON> have not been granted passports. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> this week closed its border to the ethnic Turks from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, saying they want a formal emigration agreement with <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> before allowing more to enter. Diplomats said <PERSON> Pomaks </PERSON> were threatened with legal proceedings if they did not stop applying for passports. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> faces an acute labor shortage with the sudden emigration of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Turkish workers. Last month, special regulations empowered authorities to draft labor from towns to the fields for harvesting. Reports of the unrest followed word from emigre sources that <LOCATION> Pomaks </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> were conducting hunger strikes to protest the refusal to grant passports and the continued detention of six prominent dissidents.

<HEAD>Moldavian Strike Spreads, Officials Appeal for Calm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Strikes in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> against a pending language law spread on Friday and the southern republic's government appealed for calm, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said railroad workers at <LOCATION> Bendery </LOCATION> and four other stations held two-hour strikes. More than 90 factories were idled on Thursday. About 50,000 people attended a rally in <LOCATION> Tiraspol </LOCATION> to urge postponement of the law, which would make the language of the Moldavian majority the official one for the republic. The Presidium of the republic's legislature said strikes increased `` the destablization of the socio-political situation.'' It said the law could be considered only in a calm atmosphere. Russians, Ukrainians and other non-Moldavians say the law is discriminatory and would set <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> on the same path of inter-ethnic relations as the three Baltic republics _ <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Pravda, the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said Friday that no tolerance for minorities remained in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. `` An overt division of forces ... is now under way in the republic,'' it declared. It accused leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, who recently have joined calls for independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, of lacking a clear program of local reform. The Moldavian strikes follow the pattern in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, where non-Estonians walked out for nine days earlier this month to protest a law setting residency requirements for voting and seeking local office. Protesters in <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> also say the republic's government allowed too little time for public discussion of the law before the legislature considers it Aug. 29. The draft law was published by the official press Sunday. Leaders of the Moldavian <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> say the draft proposal does not go far enough. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON>, a spokesman, said it gives <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> nearly the same status as Moldavian. He said the People's Front supported the law but would try to have it amended by the legislature. <PERSON> Rozhgo </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> would hold a large rally Sunday in central <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION> to press its demands. Moldavians make up about 64 percent of the republic's 4.2 million people but are outnumbered in many major cities, where Russian is widely used. In addition to making Moldavian the official language, the law would return the republic to the Latin alphabet from the Cyrillic. After <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> was forcibly taken from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1940, the alphabet was changed to emphasize the Soviet view that Moldavians and Romanians were distinct nationalities.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two city police officers were charged Friday with armed robbery and assault in incidents that netted them $ 140, a department spokesman said. Police said the charges involved two incidents in which the two officers allegedly worked together. <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 30, both of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, were arrested after a four-day investigation indicated they were involved in the robberies, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Celester </PERSON>, deputy superintendent of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mattapan </LOCATION> districts. The offenses occurred between 11 p.m. Aug. 19 and 1 a.m. Aug. 20 in a busy section of <LOCATION> Mattapan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Celester </PERSON> said. According to police, in the first incident, one person was robbed and two companions were assaulted and in the second, money was taken from one individual. The police report said that in the second incident, one of the officers put a handgun to his victim's neck and identified himself as a police officer. Department spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said it was the first time he could remember that a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police officer had been arrested on robbery charges. `` We've had incidents where acts of alleged corruption have led to arrests,'' he said. `` But this is the first of its type, a robbery.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> were arraigned Friday afternoon on multiple charges of robbery and assault by means of a dangerous weapon. Bail was set at $ 2,500 cash or $ 25,000 surety. The officers, both recruited within the last four years, were off duty and in street clothes at the time of the alleged robberies, police said. They had at least one gun from which shots may have been fired, <PERSON> Celester </PERSON> said. No injuries were reported in either incident. Police were tracking a third man, who was not immediately identified, officials said. <PERSON> Celester </PERSON> said the arrests were more a boost than a blow to department morale. `` Nobody wants to see a bad police officer and when we do, we act without shedding a tear,'' <PERSON> Celester </PERSON> said. `` They worked for us and we clean our own laundry.''

 <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, the novelist threatened with death by the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> for writing the book `` The Satanic Verses,'' is living apart from his American wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, she announced Friday through her publisher. <PERSON> Secker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warburg </PERSON> issued a brief statement saying Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, herself a writer, and the Indian-born <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> `` have been living separately for four weeks. `` <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard security arrangements for the protection of Mr. <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> have been reordered since then and Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> does not know where he is,'' the statement said. `` Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> requests privacy; She is not prepared to discuss the matter further.'' The couple, who were married in January 1988, had been in hiding since last Feb. 14, when <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> should be killed because `` The Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died June 3, but his order has not been revoked. Before the separation, Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> was quoted as saying they had moved 56 times, through a succession of `` safe houses'' used for spies and intelligence contacts. They had dined occasionally with friends, literary acquaintances and political figures, such as <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Such meetings dwindled since March at the insistence of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s guards, friends say. In an interview published in June in Options, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> women's magazine, Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, 41, was quoted as saying she had been `` living the life of a paranoid schizophrenic'' in hiding `` Suddenly, I have been removed from the world and made into this person alienated in the extreme.'' The threat forced her to cancel a promotional tour in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for her novel `` John Dollar.'' Her biggest recent loss was social contact, she was quoted as saying _ `` The thing about this situation is that one is completely of good mental health and yet living the life of a paranoid schizophrenic.' Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, listening to her Scots-Irish father preach in a conservative Christian church. Her mother was Greek and on her 10th birthday, she was baptized in the Greek Orthodox Church. Like her husband, who was raised as a Moslem, she fell away from her childhood faith. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said it never confirmed that <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON> were under guard and it had nothing to say about the impact of the couple's separation. `` We do n't discuss security matters,'' a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Scotland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yard </ORGANIZATION> said, speaking under condition of anonymity.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday he will send $ 65 million worth of helicopters, weapons and other equipment to help <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in its `` courageous'' battle against drug barons who have proclaimed all-out war against their government. The first shipment, a $ 20 million package of eight <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> transport helicopters; arms such as machine guns, mortars and ammunition; 4-wheel drive vehicles; ambulances; communciations equipment and anti-tank guns, will be sent next week, said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>.

Hours after the announcement, a official who requested anonymity said discussions were still going on with the Colombians about their specific needs. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> combat troops will go to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> advisers will be sent to train the Colombians in operating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equipment. `` It's not anticipated they would be in a combat role,'' he told reporters accompanying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his vacation here. `` Our only motivation is to do as much as we can as fast as we can,'' the president's spokesman said. `` We have a war situation in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, let alone in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a statement read by <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, noted attacks by the drug lords against the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> establishment, including last week's assassination of a leading presidential candidate, and said: `` It is time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries of the world to stand with President -LRB- <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> during his courageous challenge to these insidious forces that threaten the very fabric of Colombian society. Officials said <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is most in need of transportation to conduct raids and apprehend the drug cartel operatives. The materiel, to be taken from <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> stocks, will be paid for with unspent funds made available through the 1986 Foreign Assistance Act. The act gives the president about $ 75 million in discretionary funds yearly; about $ 10 million has been spent this year, said an official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Noting that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> will get virtually all of the money left for this year, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` Since we're using all the money in the fund, it stands to reason we could have used more.'' He also said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has begun shipping a variety of military gear bought earlier by the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government, including 20 <PERSON> Huey </PERSON> and five Blackhawk helicopters. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was also lending <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> two helicopters. The administration's $ 65 million aid package does not include those helicopters. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would propose sending additional aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the Sept. 5 speech in which he will detail his administration's plan to battle drugs. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said that he supports the administration's decision and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be united with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in the drug fight. `` The drug problem will not be solved solely through the use of military measures,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said in a statement. Nevertheless, he added, `` the drug dealers can not be allowed to prevail in this struggle simply because they are willing to ignore all norms of civil society.'' The $ 65 million package will be in addition to $ 2.5 million worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security assistance to help protect Colombian judges, the primary assassination targets of the drug cartels. On Thursday, a paramilitary squad run by the powerful <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel declared it would wage `` total and absolute war on the government, on the industrial and political oligarchy,'' and others the drug lords consider their enemies. Noting that, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday advised Americans to avoid <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in fiscal 1989 was $ 29.6 million, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. Of that, $ 6 million was in military assistance, $ 1 million in military training, $ 7.6 million in development assistance, $ 10 million for the drug war, and $ 5 million to protect judges. Of the $ 5 million in judicial protection, $ 500,000 has been earmarked for armored cars and other equipment, and $ 2 million in a program to train court security guards. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> officials are working together to decide how best to spend the remaining $ 2.5 million in judicial protection, said <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>.

 Voyager 2 brushed by <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s north pole and photographed volcanoes that once gushed ice lava on frosty, fault-cracked <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, revealing `` a world unlike any we've ever seen,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. `` All we can say now is, wow! _ what a way to leave the solar system,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey geologist <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON>, deputy leader of <PERSON> Voyager </PERSON>'s photographic imaging team. The one-ton space probe capped its historic 4.43-billion mile, 12-year tour of four planets when it skimmed 3,048 miles over <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s north pole Thursday night, then dove past <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, the planet's largest moon. It made its closest approach about 23,900 miles above the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>'s surface at 2:10 a.m PDT Friday. `` We are witness today to truly an amazing feat of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> space technology,'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told hundreds of scientists and dignitaries Friday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. `` I am exceedingly delighted to be here on this very historic day for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program.'' During its approach to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, Voyager discovered six moons in addition to Nereid and frost-covered <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>, which were first observed from Earth. The spaceship also discovered one complete ring of debris around the planet and a partial ring, or ring arc, scientists believe will also prove to be a complete ring. Voyager's closest photos of <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> were recorded on tape for playback to earth this weekend, but those returned Friday astounded scientists. <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> said they showed at least three volcanoes, now inactive, that once produced flows of viscous ice _ perhaps frozen natural gas or nitrogen ice. `` The images returned this morning revealed a world unlike any we've ever seen,'' said Voyager project scientist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. While icy volcanic flows without associated craters have been seen on Uranus' moon Ariel and some other moons, `` it's the first time we've seen an icy volcano,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said, referring to one of the huge craters on <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a real volcano.'' But <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s volcanoes are `` filled with ice instead of rock. The lava flow is a flow of ice, not of rock.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> geologist <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyce </PERSON> said one of the ice volcanoes _ which look like dry lakebeds filled with smooth material _ measures several hundred miles across. Other Triton photos showed long fault lines, ridges, low-lying cliffs and `` ice structures of various sorts, like glacier terrain,'' <ORGANIZATION> JPL </ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON> Torrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` They're like things you see in polar caps on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>.'' `` It looks like there's all kinds of fault systems all over the place,'' <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> said, adding that the faults suggest `` Tritonquakes'' may have occurred at one time on the moon. Also visible were some meteorite impact craters, and long sets of parallel ridges bounding apparent valleys filled with icy `` erupted plastic masses,'' he said. The icy flows either poured down valleys or erupted from valley floors, similar to what happens if someone is `` using a razor and slicing open the side of a toothpaste tube,'' <PERSON> Soderblom </PERSON> said. He said scientists do n't yet know the makeup of the volcanic ices and other ice flows, or when the volcanoes last erupted. Earth and <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION>'s moon Io are the only objects in the solar system known to have volcanoes that are currently active. Voyager also revealed <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> has an atmosphere, as predicted. It's content was n't immediately determined, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said the haze might be like photochemical smog. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said the discovery that <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION>'s surface once was geologically active supports the theory that the backward-orbiting moon _ about four-fifths the size of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s moon _ once was a comet-like, sun-orbiting object captured into orbit around <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Under that theory, <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> initially would have orbited <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> in a long ellipse, but <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s gravity slowly pulled it into a circular orbit, making <ORGANIZATION> Triton </ORGANIZATION> a semi-molten, geologically active ball for the first billion years after its capture, he said. By 9 a.m. PDT Saturday, Voyager will be 2.753 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and 1.385 million miles from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, speeding away from the giant planet at 37,847 mph. The spacecraft revealed 400-mph winds in <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>'s bluish atmosphere, as well as cloud `` streamers'' stretching thousands of miles, and an assortment of storms, including an Earth-sized cyclone called the Great Dark Spot. Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and explored Jupiter in 1979, <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and Uranus in 1986. Its trip to <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> followed a 4.43-billion mile curving path, although the planet is now 2.75 billion miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Voyager 1 also was launched in 1977, exploring Jupiter in 1979 and <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 before speeding out of the plane of the planets. Until its official `` near encounter'' period ends Oct. 2, <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 2 will look back over its shoulder at <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>. Then it, like <ORGANIZATION> Voyager </ORGANIZATION> 1, will head toward interstellar space. `` Voyager 2 is now past <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> and is continuing to press outward into the darkest and farthest region of the solar system,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> said. `` The Voyagers are destined to wander through the Milky Way. ... What wonders they will encounter.'' <PERSON> Lennard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisk </PERSON>, an associate administrator of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, called the climax of the Voyager mission historic because `` it's the last time we're seeing a planet for the first time. We've completed the reconnaissance of the planets, except Pluto.''

<TEXT>
 This year's filbert harvest in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is estimated at 13,500 tons, down 18 percent from 1988 and the smallest output since 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The Oregon crop of filberts, or hazelnuts, was forecast at 13,300 tons, compared with 16,300 tons in 1988. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> harvest was indicated at 200 tons, the same as last year. Officials said filbert trees, particularly of the <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION> variety, were hurt by severe cold in early February during their crucial pollination stage. `` As a result, nut set is lighter than in 1988,'' the report said. `` Also, growers report a larger-than-normal number of blanks.

 An elementary school principal who admitted he let a male prostitute use offices in the building has been suspended and will not be allowed to return to work there, the president of the school board said Friday. And in the narrow neighborhood streets that surround <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in this upscale suburb of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, few people were aware of what went on for several months since <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> became principal two years ago. <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON>, who was suspended with pay from his job after school officials read an article about his activities in The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times on Friday, admitted in an interview with the newspaper he had a four-year relationship with a call-boy and gave him access to facilities at the school. The prostitute, who the newspaper said used the alias of <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, was identified Friday by Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., as <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said he had a two-year relationship with the prostitute, beginning in 1985. <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> was not at home and was not at the school on Friday. `` Right now he is suspended and there will be an acting principal in the school on Monday,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` So far as the children are concerned, his presence wo n't be a factor. `` What will happen in the future, I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> added. `` But I think it will be safe to say he will not return to Chevy Chase Elementary.'' <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, co-chair of the <ORGANIZATION> Chevy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PTA </ORGANIZATION>, said `` I really do n't have any comment. The matter is under investigation. It's unfortunate ... kind of takes you by surprise. And it's too bad.'' The prostitute told the Times he had used a guidance counselor's office at the school, usually in the evenings, where he used the telephone to set up appointments with his customers He said he did not have contact with any of the children in the school, which has students in grades three through six. <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> said he did not know the man was engaged in arranging prostitution services from the building. `` I knew he was an escort, but I did n't know he was running an escort service,'' he told the Times. `` I could n't condone it from going out of here -LRB- the school -RRB- ... He may have done that, but I did not know that.'' The prostitute told the newspaper that the principal `` was very aware of what I was doing and what was going on.'' He also said that on at least one occasion he performed a homosexual act with a client in the guidance counselor's office. The prostitute said <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> did not know `` that I had met a client at the school.'' `` There were some afternoons where he just had nowhere to go, so I would just let him come here to the school and just use the bathroom and stuff like that,'' <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> told the Times. The principal said he ended his relationship with the call-boy after the call-boy had misused his credit card. `` I just used very poor judgment. What can I tell you,'' <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> told the Times. `` It was just stupid. I never thought it through. I just thought I was helping somebody.'' In an interview with a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> television station, <ORGANIZATION> WUSA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> said `` categorically'' that no children were ever involved in any of his activities at the school. He admitted he has been convicted on felony sex and drug charges in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and said he went public on the relationship with <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> because he wants to sell his story to the entertainment industry. People living around the school and <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON>'s neighbors in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, another nearby <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> community, said nothing at the school or in the principal's behavior offered a clue as to what had been going on. None of them wanted to be quoted by name. A woman who lives near <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> said her family and his are close friends, especially after she and <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> both had sons die in their late teens or early twenties. She said <PERSON> Massaro </PERSON> and his wife had been nearly daily visitors to comfort the neighbor in the weeks since her son died. `` He's friendly, he's outgoing,'' she said. Across the street a man said `` He's one of the nicest people I ever met.'' The man said he was `` flabbergasted.'' Back near the school and a few doors down the street, a young mother said her family had just moved into the neighborhood and her kids were to start attending the school this fall. She sent her kids out into the yard to blow bubbles, while she stood inside the door and read the story in the newspaper provided by a reporter. Then she rolled her eyes and said `` It's just our luck.''

Culture Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said he found the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treatment of <PERSON> Chouraqui </PERSON> `` humiliating and unacceptable,'' but did not support blocking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films being made in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> because of assurances from American movie industry officials that the situation would be cleared up immediately. Both <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> said in their statements they had been trying to get action from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials since Monday, when <PERSON> Chouraqui </PERSON> had planned to begin work, but there apparently was opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>'s office issued the text of a message it said he received from <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Valenti </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, saying <PERSON> Chouraqui </PERSON> would have his visa `` this weekend or Monday at the latest.''

<HEAD>Strike To Protest Crime Wave Shuts Down French Guiana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAYENNE, French Guiana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Businesses, public transport and government offices were shut down Friday in a 24-hour strike to protest a crime wave attributed to immigrants from neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nations. The strike, called by the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and backed by businesses and trade unions, paralyzed Cayenne, the capital; <LOCATION> Kourou </LOCATION>, site of the European space station, and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, on the western border with <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> closed <ORGANIZATION> Rochambeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, which it manages, but police occupied it Friday and forced it to open. Chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Prevot </PERSON> said the strike was called to protest `` a surge in burglaries, crimes of all sort, usually committed with violence, and street attacks in broad daylight.'' Police blamed most of the crime on foreign immigrants, especially from neighboring <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>. In recent weeks a Cayenne accountant for a forestry company was killed and robbed of $ 47,000 in workers' salaries he was carrying, jewelry boutiques and food stores in the three main towns were robbed, and burglars broke into dozens of private homes. French Guiana is a French overseas department, or state, on the northeast shoulder of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. About 40 percent of its 100,000 residents are foreigners, mostly Haitian, Surinamese, Brazilians or Guyanese. <PERSON> Prevot </PERSON> said residents demanding the government give `` more material for police and gendarmes to help them better control foreign workers.'' He said in a statement that if authorities fail to act, `` citizens will create militias to patrol towns and protect ourselves.'' Immigrants and illegal aliens have flocked here in recent years to work in the lumber industry and raising shrimp, or, in the case of an estimated 10,000 Surinamese, to escape army repression. The only prison in Cayenne, a town of 45,000, is filled with inmates, mostly from <LOCATION> Guyana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Suriname </LOCATION>. `` We propose to help finance the construction of a new prison in <LOCATION> Cayenne </LOCATION>, because the only existing one is overcrowded,'' <PERSON> Prevot </PERSON> said.

 Several nations were drawing up a new power-sharing proposal Friday in hopes of breaking a deadlock at the international conference on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, but there was no sign of agreement among Cambodian factions. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> will not participate in next week's three-day closing session, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said, and it was not clear how many other foreign ministers from the 19 countries attending would be there. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that `` a comprehensive settlement is not in sight'' after a month of meetings because <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government it sponsors had not shown flexibility. `` The gap on major issues remains rather substantial,'' a Western delegate said privately. `` It does not appear likely the conference will achieve its objectives.'' It was called to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive settlement of the civil war in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, which began when <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in December 1978 and ousted <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>'s genocidal <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> government. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says all its forces will be withdrawn next month.

When he arrived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said: `` There will be no comprehensive settlement without the elimination of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>.'' He said the government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> `` can not sacrifice the vital interests of the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> people to satisfy other countries.'' <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> had proposed that a government of the three rebel factions and <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> run the country until general elections.

A source in the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> said the six member nations consulted with other delegations Friday on the outline of a new compromise.

<HEAD>Report Namibian Guerrillas Detained Leaders' Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Namibian guerrilla officials were so worried about infiltration by spies that they once detained the wife of their leader, a newspaper sympathetic to their cause reported Friday. The Weekly Mail, a respected anti-apartheid newspaper based in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, said in a front-page story that <PERSON> Kowambo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, wife of the guerrilla movement's president <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>, was detained in 1986 for an unspecified period on suspicion of being a South African spy. It said she now is free and is believed to have been reconciled with her husband's <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The movement waged a 23-year bush war against South African rule of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> before agreeing to a truce as part of the ongoing U.N.-sponsored transition to independence. It is expected to win November independence elections but has come under mounting criticism for its treatment of dissidents and suspected spies during the war. Asked about The Weekly Mail report, guerrilla official <PERSON> Nahas </PERSON> <PERSON> Angula </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, that he could not comment without checking with the movement's headquarters in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jesaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyamu </PERSON>, a guerrilla spokesman in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, declined to comment. <PERSON> Angula </PERSON> said he believed Mrs. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Theo-Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurirab </PERSON>, the movement's foreign affairs secretary, confirmed at a news conference Wednesday that the guerrillas had tortured some political prisoners. He also invited officials of international human rights organizations to inspect camps in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to verify the guerrillas' claim that all their prisoners have been freed In the past, the movement refused to allow inspections. On Thursday, officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> monitoring force in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> said they may inspect the camps. The Weekly Mail, quoting freed dissidents who have returned to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, said there had been an atmosphere of `` absurd paranoia and spy obsession'' within the movement. `` Persistent, detailed claims of torture and atrocities made by 237 former detainees ... have led even longstanding allies of the organization to rebuke <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> and demand a full inquiry into the treatment of suspected spies,'' said the newspaper. The `` wave of terror,'' it said, resulted partly from resentment by poorly educated security officials against members of the movement who had received university education abroad. The Weekly Mail quoted a former detainee as saying Mrs. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Hilma </PERSON> <PERSON> Mushimba </PERSON>, had been forced to say during interrogation in 1986 that her sister was a South African agent The newspaper said Mrs. <PERSON> Nujoma </PERSON> subsequently was detained, but it was not known for how long. South African government officials frequently say the newspaper is biased in favor of black opposition groups. Since its founding in 1985, the newspaper has carried numerous reports from <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> critical of South African policies in the territory and conveying the positions of the territory's guerrilla movement.

<HEAD>A Living Earth's Responses Could Worsen Greenhouse Effect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many studies predicting manmade global warming fail to consider that the Earth could heat things up more by responding with its own climate-shifting effects, scientists at a U.S.-Soviet conference said Friday. Until now, scientists have predicted global warming would be based largely on the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other atmospheric gases produced by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and logging of forests. Many say that such warming, left unchecked, could drastically alter worldwide weather patterns and increase polar-ice melting, thereby raising the sea level and flooding coastal regions. That's bad enough, but when natural responses to warming are considered, the situation looks even grimmer, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> scientist now working for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental group. `` All the models are modeling a dead Earth,'' <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> said. `` When you look at a live Earth, you get a different answer.'' Researchers are just starting to study how global warming may kill off forests and prompt the release of methane from ocean sediments, events that in turn could heat up the Earth even more. <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> predicted that these responses and other natural `` feedback'' could as much as double the amount of global warming, already forecast by current studies to range from 2 to 10 degrees over the next century. His predictions were supported by others at the conference on global warming concluding this weekend at actor-filmmaker <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>'s Sundance resort in central <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Studies supporting <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON>'s conclusions `` are accumulating on an almost day-by-day basis,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` If the biotic effects that appear to be materializing are real, they have the potential for speeding the process of warming appreciably,'' <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON> said. Global warming theories hinge on the `` greenhouse effect,'' in which certain gases in the atmosphere block incoming solar heat from escaping back out to space. Those gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, have always been present and are kept in equilibrium by natural processes. The oceans absorb carbon dioxide, for example, as do trees, which store carbon in trunks, branches and roots. But industrial societies are pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere at much-elevated rates, as well as adding new `` greenhouse gases'' such as chlorofluorocarbons. Research has so far concentrated on measuring and then reducing these manmade gases, but natural processes that occur as the globe heats up are important as well. An example: Rising temperatures could destroy entire forests, as it gets too hot for tree species adapted to the local climate. `` The growth rate of trees is very temperature-dependent. If they get too hot or too cold, they do n't grow well,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botkin </PERSON>, a biology professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. The scrub brush that follows would not store as much carbon, <PERSON> Botkin </PERSON> said. And it would take decades for other, more heat-resistant trees to migrate in from the south, he said. `` Trees may be left behind,'' he said. `` They ca n't keep up with the climate change. You'd get a pulse of carbon from those forests.'' Another natural response to global warming could involve methane trapped in offshore ocean sediments, <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> said. If the atmosphere warms, so will the oceans, releasing some of that methane into the air. A global warming-induced shift of forests to the north also could heat things up further by decreasing the amount of light reflected, <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> said. Trees of the northern boreal forest absorb more heat than the snowy tundra. But that effect could be counteracted elsewhere by greater light reflected from the spreading of grassland and desert areas, he said. <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> concedes that other natural processes may slow the rate of global warming, not increase it. One recent study suggests, for example, that warming could increase the amount of sun-blocking clouds, producing a cooling effect. But <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON>, though conceding his model depends on loose estimates for many calculations, believes the net effect of the Earth's responses would speed global warming <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON> recommended a sharp reduction in the use of fossil fuels as the best way to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide. Stopping the destruction of forests and planting new ones also could help, he said. <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> said all is not bleak, despite the gloomy predictions. Humans are causing global warming, but it appears they also can stop it _ if they act in time. `` When you take a look at the problem, you find there is a lot you can do about it,'' <PERSON> Lashof </PERSON> said.

 Security agents rescued a kidnapped <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gold merchant from a well on Friday, a day and a half after he was seized by masked Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> was found after a huge search by helicopters and hundreds of soldiers. Officials said an Arab suspect captured Thursday led agents of the <ORGANIZATION> Shin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bet </ORGANIZATION> secret service to the well in the tiny village of <LOCATION> Abush </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tukarem </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> TV said three alleged kidnappers are in custody. Army officials said the well was about 20 to 23 feet deep, but that <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON>'s head was above water. `` I am healthy, thank God, and thank you to the Israeli army and all the soldiers who helped me,'' <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON>, 47, was the first <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilian abducted in the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising, stirring speculation that leaders of the revolt were stepping up the violence in their battle against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said security officials suspected <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON>'s kidnapping was part of a hostage-bargaining operation It said <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> apprehended one suspect hours after the kidnapping and described him as a wanted member of an underground Palestinian group in <LOCATION> Abush </LOCATION>. However, officials also said they were investigating possible criminal motives for the kidnapping. `` The motive is not known. The investigation is looking into whether it is political or criminal or both,'' said Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy military spokesman. Few Israelis now venture to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> because of the uprising. Mishaniya reportedly there went to collect debts owed him by <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON>. News reports said he argued with an Arab merchant before he was grabbed Wednesday night by masked men carrying knives. <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> said on TV he was inside an Arab-owned taxi `` when several youths came running. One sat next to me on the front seat, holding a big screwdriver in his hand.'' He said the abductors blinfolded him and led him to hills where they walked for about three hours. The men `` tried to put me on a donkey, saying: ` You are an old man, it's not worth walking,' but ... I thought they wanted me to fall down and die.'' <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> said the kidnappers then drove him blindfolded in a car and finally put him in the well. At least 548 Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers or Israeli civilians during the uprising, which began in December 1987 in lands taken by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wast </LOCATION> war. Fellow Arabs killed 97 others as collaborators. Thirty-eight Israelis also died in the violence. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Friday, the army demolished three houses and partly destroyed a fourth of Palestinians accused of killing alleged collaborators or playing a role in the uprising, the army said. The army has torn down more than 200 houses in the occupied lands during the uprising, despite complaints by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and human rights groups that destroying homes amounts to collective punishment. The <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted army sources as saying a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-ager whose body was found Tuesday in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> refugee camp was killed by Israeli security forces the night before. An army spokeswoman could not confirm the report. Also Friday, the army permanently barred Palestinian writer <PERSON> Mutawakil </PERSON> <PERSON> Taha </PERSON> from entering <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said. <PERSON> Taha </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, has been repeatedly accused of fostering the uprising.

 A federal drug agent and his brother pleaded innocent to cocaine trafficking charges Friday, and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate said she would decide Monday whether either man should be freed on bail. Prosecutor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Saris </PERSON> to hold <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> without bail. Defense lawyers recommended that <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> be released with an electronic bracelet that would let authorities check his whereabouts and that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> be freed on bail. `` I do believe there is a serious risk of flight,'' Saris said, but added that she was intrigued by the bracelet idea. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who formerly ran the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> were each indicted Thursday on five counts of cocaine trafficking. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, 44, has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of his case. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, a former expert in government `` sting'' operations, was arrested by undercover officers Aug. 14 at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> while allegedly delivering suitcases filled with 62 pounds of cocaine. The 18-year DEA veteran said in an alleged confession presented Thursday in court that he was paid to ferry drugs from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. On Friday, the defense accused the government of creating the case against the <ORGANIZATION> O'Briens </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's the government that decided how much drugs to give him. It's a government-manufactured case. They attempted to present a case where they can ask for him not to be released under any conditions,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockin </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s attorney, said his client is a family man and a businessman with $ 100,000 in equity put up by his brother and his girlfriend.

 A military judge sentenced army Capt. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> to 300 days in prison for the burning of two young dissidents _ one fatally _ during an anti-government protest, but <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> will not go to jail. In handing down the sentence Thursday night, the judge, army Gen. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Parera </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> could show up in court every week for one year and sign a control book instead of actually being incarcerated. The procedure, called remission of sentence, is frequent in Chilean courts.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> chose a woman to replace a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister who resigned Friday in the second sex scandal of a disastrous year for the governing party. The appointment of <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, 61, as chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary was seen as an attempt to limit the damage caused by <PERSON> Tokuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>'s resignation from a government formed just 16 days earlier to cleanse the party's scandal-ridden image. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> is the first woman to be chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary, and it is the highest government post ever held by a woman in this male-dominated society. She formerly was director of the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, also a Cabinet position. The chief secretary presides over twice-weekly <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meetings, speaks for the government and coordinates policy discussions among ministries. <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>, 69, stepped down after acknowledging a three-year affair with a bar hostess nearly 45 years his junior. He became the sixth Cabinet member, including Prime Ministers <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, to resign in less than a year because of an influence-peddling scandal, publicity over illicit sexual liaisons and an election defeat. A major factor in the election loss last month, which cost the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> their majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s upper house, was outrage by housewives at a 3 percent sales tax the party forced through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last fall. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> has experience as a housewife as well as a bureaucrat, and can see things from a consumer's standpoint,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said in announcing the appointment. `` She will be able to include the people's perspective in policy discussions.'' <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, the popular woman leader of the newly vigorous <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has been the main beneficiary of the public discontent with the governing party. The selection of Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON> was seen as a way to counter Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>'s impact. `` I am completely speechless,'' Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> said of Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>'s appointment `` I wonder what he thinks women are. It is a reflection of a lack of responsibility of the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>'s party was the big winner in the upper house against the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who have governed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since the party was formed in 1955. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> became prime minister Aug. 9, when <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> resigned after 69 days in office to take responsibility for the election defeat. Uno also was pursued by allegations that he kept paid mistresses. <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> told a news conference Friday: `` The <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> administration had placed cleaning up politics at the head of its agenda and had been entrusted with the hopes of the people. In the end I have decided that I must resign.'' He said he had apologized to his wife, <PERSON> Kyoko </PERSON>, and she had forgiven him. Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, a former bureaucrat in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, was elected to the upper house in 1980. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> chose her for the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, her first Cabinet post, when he formed his government. Asked whether she expected problems, she told reporters, `` I was just appointed and I ca n't really tell what it is going to be like. But as far as my near 40-year professional experience is concerned, I never felt any handicaps from being a woman.'' <PERSON> Setsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiga </PERSON>, former deputy to the chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary, was named to replace her in the environment post. On Friday, he acknowledged receiving $ 21,100 in political donations from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the publishing conglomerate at the center of the influence-buying scandal that caused <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to resign June 2. `` I have many financially sound companies who support me,'' <PERSON> Shiga </PERSON> said. `` Recruit back then was regarded as a very financially healthy and growing company. I've done nothing wrong.'' Analysts said <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>'s resignation would undermine <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s leadership as he tries to rescue the reputations of the government and party `` The sex scandal ... will be particularly damaging,'' said political analyst <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>. `` The clean and progressive image was said to be the only strength for the <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> administration, which lacks a strong power base within the party.'' Commentator <PERSON> Soichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawara </PERSON> said of Mrs. <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>: `` The appointment is apparently aimed at bettering the image of the government. ... She may be helpful in some ways, but I am not confident that a politician with such limited experience can handle perhaps the most demanding position in the Cabinet.''

<TEXT>
 Soccer fans at <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> Olympic Stadium attacked each other Friday night, then united against police who tried to stop the melee. Police said 45 people were injured, including 14 officers. A police spokesman said fans ripped out thousands of the stadium's plastic seats and hurled them at each other or at officers. Fighting began late in a match between <ORGANIZATION> AEK </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Olympiakos </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, the top teams of last season, when they were tied 2-2. Small scuffles had broken out each time a team scored. When the major battle began, the game was stopped and police tried to disperse the belligerents with tear gas. The crowd turned on police and the violence spilled out of the stadium. Two police motorcycles and nearly a dozen cars were destroyed. Two policemen were hospitalized, but all others injured were treated and released, according to the police spokesman. He said the battle lasted about 1 -LCB- hours and no arrests were made.

 A group of 12 Soviet Jews said Friday they are fasting in front of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to protest being denied visas to go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government used to accept almost all Soviet Jews who applied for immigration, but changed its policy in October because of the large number now permitted to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` We have just been drinking water since Monday,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Leitman </PERSON>, who has lived for seven months with his wife and daughter in <LOCATION> Ladispoli </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` This may possibly make them change their minds.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> declined comment on the protest Friday.

Since October, about 4,000 applicants at the embassy in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> have been denied visas, he said.

 Rain and darkness forced rescuers to postpone their search Friday for a passenger plane that disappeared over the country's rugged northern mountains with 54 people. The <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Fokker-27 took off early Friday on what should have been a 45-minute flight from the <LOCATION> Korakoram </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Gilgit </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>. `` The pilot of the missing plane made a routine call seven minutes after takeoff. There was nothing after that, nothing at all to indicate the plane was in trouble,'' said <PERSON> Azra </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON>, an airline spokeswoman. The airline's chief pilot, who uses the single name <PERSON> Khizar </PERSON>, said the twin-engine plane carried 49 passengers, including five infants, and five crew members. Most of the passengers were Pakistanis, but Ms. <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> said the list included an American, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McGorrian </PERSON>, a former staff writer at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petersburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McGorrian </PERSON> was doing free-lance work in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for the Times and other newspapers Two <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 aircraft, helicopters and a small airline search plane scanned the <LOCATION> Himalaya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korakoram </LOCATION> mountains for signs of the plane until darkness and bad weather forced them to wait until Saturday. `` We are still hopeful.

 BAIE-COMEAU, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Thirteen people, including the captain of a Soviet freighter, were charged with contempt of court Friday for the dumping of 15 containers of toxic waste barred by a court injunction. The cargo remained on the government wharf of this <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> seaport Friday, blocking shipments and an adjacent ferry. It was unloaded there before dawn Thursday by the Soviet freighter <PERSON> Nadezhda </PERSON> <PERSON> Obukhova </PERSON>, which then steamed out of the harbor. Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Corriveau </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> charged four officials from <ORGANIZATION> Dynamis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Envirotech </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> company hired to dispose of the waste; a vice-president of the public utility <ORGANIZATION> Hydro-Quebec </ORGANIZATION>, which was to store the waste; six truck drivers hired to move it to a storage depot; a man, apparently Canadian, identified only as <PERSON> Gaeten </PERSON> <PERSON> Halle </PERSON>; and the freighter captain, who was not identified by name. They must appear before <PERSON> Corriveau </PERSON> on Sept. 28. Offenders can be fined up to $ 5,000 and a year in jail. The cargo of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, was shipped from <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where it was turned away by dock owners and workers after protests from environmentalists. The Soviet freighter then returned to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> with the cargo, which was to be stored temporarily at a facility near <LOCATION> Baie-Comeau </LOCATION> while authorities considered other ways to get rid of the poisonous chemical, which usually is incinerated at very high heat. <PERSON> Baie-Comeau </PERSON> community groups won a court injunction early Thursday forbidding the unloading of the cargo. Court documents say the captain was served with the injunction, but the ship slipped its moorings and set sail without the containers. The cargo is part of 1,500 tons of noxious waste that the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> government contracted <PERSON> Dynamis </PERSON> <PERSON> Envirotech </PERSON> to dispose of for $ 7.9 million. Polychlorinated biphenyls were used primarily as a coolant in electrical transformers but have been banned in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because of links to cancer. They cause skin diseases and are toxic to a variety of animals, especially fish, and may affect animal reproduction.

<TEXT>
 A convicted rapist freed on bail while awaiting trial in another rape case has been charged with murdering a bank executive who apparently was kidnapped on her lunch hour and shot in a city park. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 27, was ordered held on $ 1.6 million bond Friday in the death of <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gellenbeck </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Newington </LOCATION>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Gellenbeck </PERSON> was last seen alive when she left for her lunch break Thursday. At about 1 p.m., police checking reports of gunshots found her bullet-riddled body, fully clothed except for shoes, near the golf course in <LOCATION> Keney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. Police were awaiting test results to see if she had been raped. A spokesman for the bank said Ms. <PERSON> Gellenbeck </PERSON> was single and had worked for the bank for 16 years. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> turned himself in at <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> police headquarters about four hours later, after police surrounded his <ORGANIZATION> Bloomfield </ORGANIZATION> home. The attack in the park was similar to the 1984 kidnap and rape that landed <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> in prison. He was convicted of abducting a woman from the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> parking garage, taking her to <LOCATION> Keney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and raping her. Police have not confirmed that Ms. <PERSON> Gellenbeck </PERSON> was kidnapped Thursday, but two legal sources said she was kidnapped at the Civic Center garage before she was taken to the park. `` Based on her -LRB- appointments -RRB- calendar, there was no reason for her to be in the park at that time,'' said <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> police Lt. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. The large public park is about two miles from <LOCATION> Gellenbeck </LOCATION>'s downtown office. Asked if <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was known to <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> police, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> sighed and said, `` notoriously.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> has been arrested several times since his release from prison, believed to be in 1986, each time on charges of sexual assault or robbery. But prosecutors have been unable to keep him behind bars as he awaits trial. After being freed from prison and put on probation for his 1984 conviction, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was arrested and jailed again in June 1988 on charges he forced a woman's car off of a highway in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, then kidnapped her and raped her. But in June of this year, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, still awaiting trial, was released when he put up his father's storefront church as a $ 200,000 property bond <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> was arrested again July 29 on charges of robbery and larceny in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, but again he made bond. Prosecutors went to court as recently as Monday seeking to have the bond increased, but a judge put off a ruling because <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s lawyer was out of town. `` This has been a very frustrating case for the state,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` We have done everything we could under the current law to keep him incarcerated.'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> complained that state laws prevent pretrial detention for suspects believed to be dangerous, and prevent judges from considering how dangerous an accused criminal is when they set bond. Bond is set based on whether a judge believes the accused will show up for trial, and no one is held without bond, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` We've been arguing for five years for preventive detention _ no bail _ if the guy is dangerous,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kocay </PERSON> set <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>'s current bond so high, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said, because the number of charges against him increased the likelihood that he would not show up for trial.

 A woman who at one time claimed to be <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s wife was sent to prison Friday after police said she trespassed at the talk show host's <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> home for the fifth time in the past year. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, 37, was arrested Thursday after being caught by the talk show host at his home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> had violated terms of her probation by reappearing at the home outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He ordered her to spend nine months at <LOCATION> Niantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Women </LOCATION>'s Prison in eastern <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> declined to press charges after notifying police Thursday he had seen Ray walking on the grounds of his home, said Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. But prosecutors pressed the case, noting her appearance violated the terms of her probation, <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Ray of <LOCATION> Paonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was on probation for earlier break-ins to <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s home. She was arrested at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION> railroad station about 4 p.m. Thursday, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Basso </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, who was previously arrested in May 1988 and February of this year in connection with break-ins at the comedian's home, pleaded guilty May 30 to using <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s car without his permission and to two counts of first-degree criminal trespass. As part of a plea bargain, other charges including burglary and larceny were dropped. <ORGANIZATION> Norwalk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> gave her a one-year suspended sentence and three years probation, ordering her to stay away from <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> and continue to undergo psychiatric treatment. In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in April, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> described <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> as `` the dominant figure in my life,'' and apologized for breaking into his home. In May 1988, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was arrested when she tried to pass herself off as <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s wife after she was stopped at the Lincoln Tunnel between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> driving <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s sports car. Police said she told a toll collector she was married to <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> and the small child with her was their son. Police said they later discovered that someone had broken into the comedian's home and apparently lived there for several days while he was out of town. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> originally declined to press charges, but <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> was then arrested a few days later at his home. She was placed on probation in September and underwent psychiatric treatment. She was arrested again twice in February in connection with break-ins at <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s home Feb. 24 and Feb. 28.

Instead, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> sent a note questioning the committee's legality Parliament voted in July to authorize investigation of <LOCATION> Panpandreou </LOCATION> and four of his former ministers in the $ 210 million <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION> embezzlement scandal. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> lost national elections in June amid allegations that he and former ministers authorized the activities of the bank's owner and chairman, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>, or took bribes from him.. A government formed by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> and Progress vowed a cleanup <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November, but a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> magistrate ruled this week he should be extradited to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The banker has claimed in interviews that <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> blackmailed him into embezzling for the benefit of his party. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> denies it. In his message to the committee on Friday, <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> wrote: `` I will not go into the legality of the proposal for an investigation and the procedures of the committee, nor into the interests which they undoubtedly serve.'' He referred members to a memorandum he submitted last February to an earlier commission of inquiry formed when he was premier. That committee was disbanded prior to the elections before submitting a report. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said then that he met three times with <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON> at <PERSON> Koskotas </PERSON>' request, but that he moved swiftly to order an investigation into the banker's illegal activities when informed of them. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and his party say the scandal has been exploited by their political enemies. The committee must submit its report to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> by Sept. 9. Deputies will then vote on whether <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and his former ministers will stand trial before a special court. Meanwhile, another parliamentary committee investigating widespread wiretaps allegedly carried out during <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s eight years in power asked <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> on Friday to testify or submit a memorandum before the month ends. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> is also being investigated in connection with his government's purchase of 80 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French jet fighters that the present government claims were overpriced.

<HEAD>Hungary Increases Border Patrols to Stop East German Refugees</HEAD>

 Hungarian authorities stepped up border patrols, slowing the flow of East German refugees who they acknowledged Friday are fleeing illegally from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to reach the West. In neighboring <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> media reported authorities have extended restricted border zones and decreed border guards can use arms to stop Romanians trying to flee to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s admission came in an <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> state news agency report that 14 East Germans were caught illegally crossing the border from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, the only country East Germans can visit without permission from their Communist government. East Germans who escaped have told Western reporters that some risked two illegal crossings _ from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and then into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> _ but there had been no official word before Friday. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> also announced that armed workers' militiamen have joined border patrols to stop the exodus. Only 85 East Germans made it to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> overnight, compared with hundreds each night earlier this week, said a West German diplomat in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> who asked for anonymity. `` Restrictions have been introduced along the border to cope with the chaotic situation there,'' said a spokesman for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s border guards. Hungarian officials declined to say whether they acted under pressure from their <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said 38 workers' militia squads have patrolled the border in recent weeks, while another 244 militiamen are helping guards in Gyoer-Sopron border region. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the Bavarian state government said Friday it opened a third reception camp for East German refugees because two opened this summer are overwhelmed. Officials said they Thursday took 108 East Germans to the new camp, near <LOCATION> Nuremberg </LOCATION>. The refugees had spent up to a month at the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. About 5,000 East Germans have reached the West across the Hungarian-Austrian border since the exodus began in the second half of July, after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling border barriers. Escapees arriving Thursday in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s easternmost <LOCATION> Burgenland </LOCATION> province said police are turning back would-be refugees. They and Austrian sources said cars with East German license plates no longer are allowed to enter the town of <LOCATION> Sopron </LOCATION>, less than six miles from the border. A mass escape bid by East Germans who arrived at the border in three buses and three taxis was thwarted Wednesday, Hungarian media reported. An East German turned back in that convoy later managed to dash to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and told reporters that border guards wielded truncheons to force back people walking toward the border. The <ORGANIZATION> Austria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that 10 Romanians were among refugees who crossed near <LOCATION> Moerbisch </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Neusiedl </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> gives asylum to Romanian citizens, most of them ethnic Hungarians, but many want to be in the West and can not get entry visas. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency Friday quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Romanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> as saying no permanent residential settlements will be permitted near the border, and `` protective works'' and alarm systems are being constructed. The decree also gave border guards greater latitude to use firearms to prevent `` arrested persons or those assisting them'' from escaping.

 <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION> asked <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Friday to extradite the <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, son of deposed Paraguayan dictator <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, to face charges of extortion and other crimes. <PERSON> Geronimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Narvaez </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Paraguayan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> his country formally petitioned <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to turn over the 46-year-old former air force colonel, presumed to be living in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s capital. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> flew to exile in neighboring <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> with his father after a coup in February ended 34 years of Gen. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s dictatorial rule. The new government stripped <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> of his military rank and charged him with corruption and illicit gains. <PERSON> Narvaez </PERSON> said the government seized $ 100 million of the son's holdings in April and that charges against him include extorting money from Paraguayan casinos. A Paraguyan police report said <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> received at least $ 725,000 a month from three <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION> bingo houses in 1985-88. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ruy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nogueira </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has not yet received a formal extradition request.

 The mother of a baby who died of a cocaine overdose has been sentenced to six months in jail for criminally negligent homicide. <PERSON> Geralyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON>, 23, who is 7 -LCB- months pregnant, also was placed on five years probation by Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON>. `` Life is cheap,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> after the sentencing Thursday. <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> originally was charged with manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years. She pleaded no contest when the district attorney's office agreed to reduce the charge. An autopsy found 2-week-old <PERSON> David </PERSON> died Oct. 22, 1988, from a heart attack caused by a cocaine overdose. <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON>, a former exotic dancer, was charged after state troopers tested the infant's bottle and found traces of cocaine in it. A trooper said <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON>, a confessed cocaine user, admitted to mixing the formula and feeding the infant earlier that evening. `` The infant was killed as a result of substance abuse,'' <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> ruled. <PERSON> David </PERSON> was born with cocaine in his system. The Division of Family and <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> would not release the baby to <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> until the drug left his system and <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> agreed to have him tested for the drug twice a week. Trooper Investigator <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> brought <PERSON> David </PERSON> in twice for the test, which he passed, but she missed the third session. <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON>' 18-month-old son, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON>, was also tested after his brother's death and cocaine was found in his system. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> that urinalysis tests for cocaine given to <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> from January through June 12 found traces of cocaine residue in her system. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said that meant <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> was using cocaine during the first trimester of her present pregnancy. She must report to jail Dec. 1. She is due to deliver her next child Oct. 1. <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> also was ordered to complete a six to 18-month drug treatment program after her jail term. In announcing the sentence, <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> said the court is obligated to send a message to the public that `` this kind of conduct will not be tolerated.'' <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Canarsky </PERSON> of the public defenders office, said <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> was herself a victim _ `` a passive recipient of drugs'' from her former boyfriend. He said the man beat <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON>, forced her to work as a topless dancer and supplied her with cocaine. <PERSON> Canarsksy </PERSON> said since <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> left the man she has been drug free and her urinalysis tests have come back clean. <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> has been free on her own recognizance since her arrest. <PERSON> Canarsky </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Hodges </PERSON> to assign <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> to a residential treatment program instead of jail. He said Friday that <PERSON> Grubbs </PERSON> has not decided whether to appeal. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Friday, a judge imposed 15 years of probation on a cocaine-addicted mother convicted of delivering drugs to two of her children at birth. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 23, faced a 30-year prison sentence on the conviction.

 Five young white men were charged Friday as members of the gang that killed a black teen-ager in a rage against interracial dating, and a sixth suspect was being sought, police said. Police would not say if the man being sought is the person who shot <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> on Wednesday. But police sources have said they know the identity of the gunman, who was believed to be still in the city. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 16, and three friends came to a predominantly white section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> known as <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> on Wednesday night to try to buy a used car. Among those charged Friday was <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>, 18, who police said was the youth whose troubles with a girlfriend led to the attack of the four blacks by up to 30 young men, many wielding baseball bats. <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> and his friends were said to be enraged that his former girlfriend had been dating black and Hispanic men and were trying to prevent non-whites from attending the girl's birthday party, police said. However, <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>'s attorney said his client was n't the jilted boyfriend. <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON>, 18; <PERSON> Pasquale </PERSON> <PERSON> Raucci </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stressler </PERSON>, 21, were charged with assault, riot, aggravated harassment, violation of civil rights, menacing, and possessing a weapon, a baseball bat. <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> and <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON> also were charged with conspiracy. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Patino </PERSON>, 24, the fifth person arrested, was charged later with assault, riot, aggravated harassment and violation of civil rights, said a police spokesman, Officer <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON>. The top charge, assault, carries a maximum penalty of five to 15 years. The slaying drew appeals from throughout the city for renewed efforts to repair race relations. Memorial and protest marches were organized for the weekend. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' death and the outrage over it was reminiscent of the strife-filled mood following the <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> racial attack of December 1986, when <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, a black, was hit by a car while fleeing a gang of white teen-agers incensed at blacks entering their <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> neighborhood. Some figures who had roles in the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> drama entered the <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> case within hours of its unfolding. Those included <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, the lawyer who won the only acquittal among the major <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> defendants, and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, who as attorney for one of the black survivors forced appointment of a special prosecutor. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> is <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON>'s lawyer; <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> is representing <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' companions, who was not injured in the attack. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, chief of the office's homicide bureau, headed the <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> investigation <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> investigated the 1982 slaying of <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, a black transit worker beaten to death by a crowd of whites outside a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> bagel shop. Four suspects were convicted of manslaughter or assault. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> told reporters that <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> was not the boyfriend jilted by <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> conceded being at the scene and having a bat, but maintained that <PERSON> Mondello </PERSON> was armed to protect himself against the girl's threat that her black and <PERSON> Hispanic </PERSON> friends would beat him up. Police said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON> was cooperating with the investigation. Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the gang of 10 to 30 whites were looking for blacks and Hispanics they believed were coming to the neighborhood to attend Miss <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>'s 18th birthday party. They did not know that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Feliciano </PERSON>, fearing trouble, had called off the party. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the white youths mistakenly went after <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and his friends, <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION>, 18, <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Banner </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON>, 17. <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> is a cousin of <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beach </PERSON> victim. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the only black candidate in the September mayoral primary, said: `` It was n't mistaken identity. It was a case of any nigger will do.'' Many New Yorkers `` have closed their eyes and tried to pretend that this city is not choking with racial hatred,'' <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, head of the city <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> renewed its call for appointment of a permanent special prosecutor for bias crimes. League President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Polk </PERSON> also proposed setting up `` sting operations in neighborhoods with histories or recent incidents of racially motivated harassment or violence.'' <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>, a predominately <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> and Jewish neighborhood, has been the site of other racial incidents. Two blacks were beaten by a gang of whites there on Christmas Day 1987. That gang allegedly yelled, `` This is our <LOCATION> Howard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Gravesend </LOCATION>, the neighborhood where <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> was killed, is nearby. The four suspects were hustled out of the precinct station Friday in bulletproof vests because of a death threat. An anonymous caller had told a desk sergeant shortly before 9 a.m. that `` they were going to get those guys as soon as they left the station,'' Inspector <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayronne </PERSON> said.

 A judge found a drifter guilty of first-degree murder Friday in the beating death of a 24-year-old woman who had just started working as an intern reporter at the local newspaper. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Woidtke </PERSON>, 28, was convicted of killing <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a recent graduate of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who had been in town only 11 days when she disappeared June 19, 1988. Her nude body was found in a dry creek bed a week later by a custodian at <ORGANIZATION> Belleville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, had come to <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to work for the <ORGANIZATION> Belleville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Democrat </ORGANIZATION>. Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON>, who presided over the five-day bench trial, set sentencing for Sept. 28. <PERSON> Woidtke </PERSON> could face a 20 - to 60-year sentence In closing arguments earlier Friday, defense attorney <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trentmann </PERSON> said police made <PERSON> Woidtke </PERSON> a scapegoat in the slaying and failed to fully examine the possibility of other suspects. `` They picked up this poor transient who clearly has a mental problem and threw him in the slammer,'' <PERSON> Trentmann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney, said <PERSON> Woidtke </PERSON> knew too much about the crime scene to be innocent _ including the position of the pipe used in the murder. `` I think the evidence shows clearly that the defendant is a troubled person, full of sexual delusions, feelings of sexual inadequacies, with a burning desire to find a woman and have a relationship,'' <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> said. `` He decided to take that action and got himself a woman. We do n't know how, but he got <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>.'' At a pre-trial hearing last week, police Sgt. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> said that when he interviewed <PERSON> Woidtke </PERSON> on June 27, 1988 _ the day he was arrested for crossing police lines near the site where the body was discovered a day earlier _ the first question he asked was whether the suspect had killed and sexually assaulted Ms. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. `` He answered yes and no. He answered that he had killed her but that he did not rape her,'' <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> said. It could not be determined whether Ms. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> had been raped because of the decomposition of her body, authorities said. Court-appointed psychologist Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuneo </PERSON> testified Friday that when he first examined <PERSON> Woidtke </PERSON> last summer, he concluded the defendant was a paranoid schizophrenic. <PERSON> Woidtke </PERSON> initially was ruled unfit to stand trial in Ms. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>' death In June, based on a report by a psychiatrist at the <ORGANIZATION> Chester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that he had made substantial improvement, a judge declared Woidtke fit for trial.

 A Guardian Angel whose shooting death last weekend led to protests and accusations from the crimefighting group had killed himself playing Russian roulette with two members, one of them 14, authorities in this <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> suburb said Friday. `` I should have used more caution'' before criticizing police and publicly naming two people as the suspected killers, said <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> after learning of the results of the police investigation. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> also said he would meet with members of the civilian group to emphasize its policy against weapons. Prince <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Lt. Col. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 19, had apparently initiated the game and was the first one to pull the trigger on the .357 - caliber Magnum when he was killed late Saturday One of the other two was 14 years old and the other was 22, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said, refusing to name them. He also said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had been drinking and with a blood alcohol level of 0.07 percent was close to the 0.08 percent concentration that <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> uses to define as `` under the influence'' of alcohol. The state defines `` intoxicated'' as 0.10 percent. `` It's just a terrible tragedy for the group, for <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON> and the community at large,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said. Russian roulette is played by loading only one round into a revolver and spinning the cylinder. The player then points the gun at his own head and pulls the trigger, hoping the hammer strikes an empty chamber. The shooting happened in the organization's office in a drug-ridden apartment complex where the group has patrolled since April. The group immediately claimed the recruit was killed by drug dealers and organized several demonstrations this week to protest <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s death. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said the tragedy began when <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> found the door to the office ajar. <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> `` called in two recruits that he knew personally.'' `` Because one of them assumed there was a break-in, one took his father's revolver,'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said. `` They went to the headquarters and were sitting around. Apparently <PERSON> Dorian </PERSON> had booze and he and one other -LRB- recruit -RRB- were drinking and the other one took the weapon out.'' <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON> said he would reinforce the anti-weapons policy `` in the face of this prevailing notion that you solve problems with a gun.'' Earlier in the day, bounty hunters captured a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> unit, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, 19, who they said had failed to appear in <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on a robbery charge.

 The West, while applauding <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new Solidarity government, is being reticent about helping the country get back on its economic feet, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said in a television interview. In an interview with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said the world _ including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ would be blamed if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> does not get any more financial help and the fledging Solidarity government fails to bring economic prosperity. The interview was scheduled for broadcast Friday evening. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Solidarity's vision involved a mixture of philosophies and practices combining the best of capitalism with the best of what <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has now. `` We're not able to do it by ourselves alone, and we ask everybody who is listening to us to loosen the loop of our debt,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` Today the West is applauding <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but it's behaving like a young lady who wants to, but she is afraid at the same time. He invited joint ventures and said: `` Give us the money, we'll implement the contract, and we'll give the money back ... We want cooperation. We do n't want new debts.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s failure would be the world's failure, he said. `` I will say that, if we fail, we can blame the world, even the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that you have n't contributed with cooperation in these conditions of civilization development, you will be to blame for Polish failure,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. Asked if <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> wanted to emulate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said: `` Who would n't want to be the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>? ... But, on the other hand, we would like to leave what is good in our country, to retain what is good in our country, so it would be a mixture of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> assumed office Thursday in a historic transfer of power from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to a Solidarity-led coalition, the first government led by non-Communists in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc.

<HEAD>Three Arrested in Slaying of Conservationist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police are interrogating three suspects in the slaying of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, the British conservationist who devoted his life to returning lions born in captivity to the wild, the ruling party newspaper said. The <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> Times said police arrested the three men in northern <LOCATION> Kora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reserve </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> and two assistants were shot and killed Sunday by three robbers armed with automatic rifles. It did not say when the suspects were arrested. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s slaying was the third fatal attack in the wilds of this East African nation since July. Publicity surrounding his death and the slayings of an American woman and a French couple threatens to harm <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s tourism industry, the country's prime foreign currency earner. Officials say travel basically is safe. They blame the recent violence partly on a massive effort to save <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>'s elephants, which they say has driven well-armed poachers to other forms of banditry. The Times, owned by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Kenya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said police plan to parade the suspects for possible identification before <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s workers who witnessed the killings. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilonzo </PERSON> was not available for comment, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>, the director of wildlife management, said he had no way to confirm or deny the report. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, 83, earned international fame for his work with his wife <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> to return lions to the wild. Their achievements are detailed in the film `` Born Free'' and a sequel, `` Living Free.'' Both movies are based on books by his wife, who was killed at northwestern <ORGANIZATION> Shamba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in 1980 by a servant she had dismissed on suspicion of theft. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> moved into <ORGANIZATION> Kora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in 1971 and helped dozens of lions learn to survive in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> before freeing them. He and his wife separated in the late 1960s and had no children. <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, who was called the Lion Man of <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, will be buried with honors at <ORGANIZATION> Kora </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> next week.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former federal drug agent charged with cocaine trafficking allegedly confessed to the crime the night he was arrested, according to testimony Thursday in federal court. But <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s defense attorneys portrayed him as a man known by government investigators to be in deep financial and emotional trouble months before they set him up and arrested him in an undercover sting. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> signed a statement Aug. 15 saying that on two occasions he was paid a total of $ 39,000 to ferry drugs with another man from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for a man who identified himself as a cocaine dealer, according to a copy of the document presented at the hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Saris </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a senior inspector with the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Professional Responsibility, also testified that <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> admitted under questioning that he had used a total of $ 147,000 in <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> money for personal business, but later replaced the money. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, who formerly ran the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, and his brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> were each indicted Thursday on five counts of cocaine trafficking. The two were being held without bail pending the outcome of the detention hearing, which was expected to resume Friday. Charges against a third brother, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, were dismissed Thursday, but prosecutor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> refused to explain why. Attorneys for <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> argued that the pre-trial publicity had already made it impossible for the brothers to get a fair trial. They asked the judge to close the bail hearing to the public. <PERSON> Saris </PERSON> refused, saying the most damaging information has probably already been disclosed. That decision cleared the way for <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s alleged confession to be read allowed in court In the five-page statement, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> wrote in longhand that he brought drugs to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> twice, once by car for $ 25,000 and again by airplane for $ 14,000. He was arrested after the second trip. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said he gave $ 8,000 from the first advance to his brother <PERSON> John </PERSON> to repay a loan to <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s girlfriend. In addition, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> wrote, `` During the last 2 -LCB- years ... I utilized some of the seized funds which were later replaced. The total used, but not in one lump sum, was approximately $ 147,000.'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> allegedly used the money to help bail out the family's floundering company, <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ice </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> told him that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> had allegedly skimmed some $ 230,000 from the business. Under cross examination by defense attorneys, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> acknowledged that he had information from three informants and a <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> police lieutenant as early as February or March indicating that <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> was emotionally unstable and possibly suicidal. The defense attempted to show that the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> never approached <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> about the missing money, or requested a psychological evaluation, or offered him any kind of help. Instead, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> set up a sting. `` You just wait for them to fall,'' concluded <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>'s defense attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> `` I'm not a psychiatrist,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> replied. `` My job is to put people in jail.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Broadcast engineers, camera workers and newswriters have accepted a four-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities-ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The contract goes into effect Saturday for all 2,500 members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> and Technicians except two people who make up a newswriters unit in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Union officials said something would be worked out soon with the two holdouts. The contract, which replaces one that expired March 31, provides a first-year ratification bonus ranging from 6.1 percent to 7 percent. There are 3 percent raises in each of the second and third years and a 4 percent increase in the fourth year. `` The contract, although lacking in many areas, is considered by the union as the best it could obtain under the present circumstances facing <ORGANIZATION> NABET </ORGANIZATION> and others in the broadcast industry,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON>, a union spokesman. `` It was best to reach a settlement through considerable compromise rather than through any confrontation as we did with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> in the 17-week strike in 1987,'' <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NABET </ORGANIZATION> represents engineers, camera workers, video tape editors, newswriters, makeup people, publicists, couriers and traffic and communication coordinators. The contract covers units at Cap Cities-ABC radio and television network operations and radio and television stations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and various news bureaus. The pressing issue was job security for radio engineers in an era when broadcast companies are needing their specialized, restricted services less and less. <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> said the company promised to move the endangered radio engineers into television if necessary. The company said it got increased flexibility to overcome a number of restrictive work rules, including rules that restricted certain jobs, such as turning microphones off and on, to engineers. The company said the contract also gives it an enhanced ability to acquire and originate live and taped sports, news and entertainment programing and broader and more flexible daily employment rights. `` The new contract grants the company the relief we sought since the negotiations began six months ago, while providing the union with certain securities it sought,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruthizer </PERSON>, the Cap Cities-ABC chief negotiator, said in a statement Friday.

<HEAD>Report Courts Investigated Alleged Nazi-Era Murders of Retarded Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New evidence has prompted prosecutors to investigate whether <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> killed retarded children during World War II, a newspaper said Friday. According to the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper, historian <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Teppe </PERSON> has found evidence that 3,000 mentally retarded children were killed in <LOCATION> Dortmund </LOCATION> area hospitals after undergoing Nazi experiments between 1939 and 1945. Dortmund chief prosecutor <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON> was not in his office Friday and could not be reached for comment on the report. The Nazis' fatal experiments on people are part of the historical record, but the newspaper said the killings uncovered by <PERSON> Teppe </PERSON> were not previously known. <PERSON> Teppe </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Muenster </LOCATION>, uncovered the evidence while looking into the wartime operations of seven hospitals, according to the newspaper. One of the institutions was the <LOCATION> Dortmund-Aplerbeck </LOCATION> hospital, which now is the <ORGANIZATION> Westphalia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION>. Officials there were shocked by <PERSON> Teppe </PERSON>'s conclusions and have started their own investigation, the newspaper said. It quoted clinic official <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Jedwabski </PERSON> as saying: `` The doctors and nurses who work in the clinic today are all with certainty free from blame.'' But she added, `` We can not just let this drop, especially since there are many patients here who themselves certainly would have become -LRB- Nazi -RRB- victims.'' <PERSON> Schacht </PERSON> is worried the investigation could be hindered by the length of time that has passed since the end of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> era, the newspaper said. `` It is suspected that many documents have disappeared since 1945, and it is still unclear who among the responsible doctors and nurses is still alive,'' according to the newspaper. An estimated 6 million people were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust.

 Soldiers killed a Palestinian youth, a 15-year-old died while being questioned, and an Israeli gold dealer was kidnapped on a nighttime business trip to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, according to army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports Thursday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected appeals by four Palestinians of army orders to deport them as leaders of the 20-month-old uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shaul </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON>, 47, was the first Israeli abducted since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987, and officials said the motive might be criminal. Hundreds of soldiers and police were searching for him. The 15-year-old Palestinian died mysteriously Wednesday while being questioned by soldiers near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Arab reporters in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> said a 19-year-old was shot down Wednesday night by soldiers in civilian dress driving cars with <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> license plates. His death was the ninth reported this week in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. At least 547 Palestinians have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops or civilians in the uprising and 97 have been slain by fellow Arabs as alleged collaborators. Thirty-eight Israelis have died. The army said it detained about 120 Palestinians suspected of security offenses over the last days. Officials said the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> arrests are likely to continue. In the mixed Arab-Jewish <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Jaffa </LOCATION>, police detained seven Arabs suspected of passing weapons to <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army imposed curfews on <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> and surrounding villages while helicopters criss-crossed the area and security forces conducted a house-to-house search for Mishaniya. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> colonel, not identified, said on army radio: `` We go from one house to another, door to door, to the roofs, basements... as far as the imagination can go. <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> was seized after hundreds of masked youths surrounded an Arab-driven taxi he took to Tulkaren on Wednesday night. Israeli radio quoted his family as saying <PERSON> Mishaniya </PERSON> was having financial troubles and went to <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> to collect debts from Arab gold dealers, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> sources said he often went to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on business at night. Few Israelis except Jewish settlers venture into the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, where cars driven by Israelis are frequent targets of stones and firebombs. <PERSON> Yuval </PERSON> <PERSON> Neeman </PERSON>, a legislator from the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio all residents of the Palestinian refugee camp at <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> should be deported in retaliation for the kidnapping. That would be nearly 10,000 people. Deportation of the four men whose appeals were rejected would bring the number expelled in the rebellion to 59. They are <PERSON> Taysir </PERSON> <PERSON> Aruri </PERSON>, a physics professor whose case has been championed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and foreign scientists; <PERSON> Odeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Maali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Majed </PERSON> <PERSON> Labadi </PERSON>, both union organizers, and <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Matur </PERSON>, a teacher. Officials said <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, 15, was dead on arrival at <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. A cousin, <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasrallah </PERSON>, said he died while being questioned by soldiers in <LOCATION> Izzariye </LOCATION>, the biblical village of <LOCATION> Bethany </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s outskirts. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said soldiers stopped them and a soldier questioning his cousin suddenly cried out: `` Your friend is dead!'' `` I did n't hear any shots or anything,'' <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> said. `` I saw two marks, one on his face and one on his arm.'' Military sources said the youth apparently fainted and died while being questioned. The army ordered an autopsy. The Arab reporters in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Iyad </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON>, 19, was killed when soldiers in civilian clothes opened fire on masked youths painting anti-Israeli slogans on walls in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. An army spokesman, who can not be identified under military regulations, said the youths ran when soldiers approached. `` They looked suspicious,'' he said. `` That's why they were being arrested.'' He said soldiers shouted warnings and fired in the air, then opened fire when the Palestinians kept running. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officials would not say whether the soldiers were disguised. One source said security forces use disguises when trying to capture <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> `` shock troops'' who attack Arabs accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Derick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounder </PERSON>, a Scottish pathologist, said a second autopsy on a Palestinian-American killed Aug. 18 revealed that he died of a bullet wound in the back but provided no clues about who killed him. The autopsy was requested by the family of 14-year-old <PERSON> Amjad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jebril </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Relatives accused soldiers of killing him, but an army statement said its investigation showed soldiers were not involved. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> promised the family of the youth it would press <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to complete its investigation of the killing.

 The family of an entertainment executive found slain in his <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> mansion believes mobsters had him executed because he refused to do business with them, his sister said Friday. `` We think he made the mistake of buying a business that had been used before by the Mafia, and we think he was trying to run it straight,'' <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez-Cano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said after a memorial service. Her brother, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON>, was found shot to death Sunday night along with his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, 44, in their home, a $ 4 million Spanish-style mansion with a tennis court. <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON>, 45, once headed RCA-Ariola Records as well as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rental car operations for the <ORGANIZATION> Hertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He was chief executive officer and chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Live </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Carolco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the video and music distribution business, and had been praised for improving the company's performance. Two of the three companies operated by <ORGANIZATION> Live </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> had been linked to organized crime before Live Entertainment bought them, although Live Entertainment acting President <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has vehemently rejected suggestions that the deaths may have a mob link. Ms. <PERSON> Menendez-Cano </PERSON>, the dead man's sister, and former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Lt. Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Curb </PERSON>, a friend for nearly a decade, described <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> as absolutely honest, although an extremely aggressive businessman. `` He was very direct, although he had a great sense of humor,'' said Curb, the owner of a small record label who met <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON> when <PERSON> Curb </PERSON> was negotiating with RCA to distribute a record by the country act The <ORGANIZATION> Judds </ORGANIZATION>. `` Sometimes he had to tell people things they did n't want to hear,'' <PERSON> Curb </PERSON> said. `` But he was a wonderful guy, an absolutely outstanding person. I just ca n't believe something like this could happen.'' Curb and Ms. <PERSON> Menendez-Cano </PERSON> spoke outside a memorial at the Directors Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where 400 people listened to the <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON>'s sons, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, 18, and <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON>, 22, eulogize their parents. Ms. <PERSON> Menendez-Cano </PERSON> said she had been unaware that two of her brother's companies had once been linked to organized crime until she read newspaper stories on the killings. She said her brother had always tried to keep the video business clean. `` The first thing he did was to get rid of the porno business,'' she said. `` Because of his success, he probably was stepping on many shoes, which some people did n't like.'' International Video Entertainment, which Live Entertainment purchased in 1986, had been owned by <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>. Bloom was identified in a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> attorney general's report on organized crime that year as a major distributor of X-rated movies and a former associate of the late <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaffarano </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> organized-crime family. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Carolco </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive, said <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> itself was never involved in pornography. The other company with a crime-linked past was <ORGANIZATION> BeckZack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the 81-store Strawberries audio and home-video retailing chain in the Northeast. Live Entertainment completed its acquisition of BeckZack this June. <PERSON> Beckzack </PERSON>'s principal shareholder, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, was convicted in May 1988 of conspiring to extort payments from a record wholesaler. He remains free pending an appeal of his conviction. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> affidavit filed in federal court in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in connection with an investigation of <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> quoted an unidentified informant as saying that a faction of the Genovese crime family owned an interest in the Strawberries chain. The documents called <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> `` a lucrative source of cash and property'' for the <PERSON> Genovese </PERSON> family leaders. Ms. <PERSON> Menendez-Cano </PERSON> said her brother had big plans to expand. `` He said he would be controlling the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> video business, through his careful planning, in the next couple of years.'' Live Entertainment announced Friday that it was forming a committee to search for a successor to <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Second Ethiopian Rebel Group Accepts Carter's Mediation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A second rebel group in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> has approved former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> as an observer for peace talks, but a <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday the group would not be included in the discussions here. Representatives of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and another rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, plan to meet at the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> beginning Sept. 7 with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> acting as an observer. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> announced in a clandestine radio broadcast that it was accepting <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, calling on the Ethiopian government to `` respond quickly'' to the proposal. <PERSON> Dayle </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> fellow who heads the presidential library's conflict resolution programs, said the Tigrean announcement was welcome news, but that their conflict with the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> government is unrelated to that of the Eritreans. As a result, Ms. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, talks between the Ethiopian government and the Tigreans could not be included in the September meeting. She added that <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> would get involved in the Tigrean issue only if <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> also agreed. The Tigrean rebels, based in <LOCATION> Tigray </LOCATION> province, took up arms 14 years ago to press for increased autonomy for their region. Early this year, they scored several major victories and forced troops out of five towns, including the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Mekele </LOCATION>, 470 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. The Eritreans, in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s northernmost <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> province, have been fighting for independence since 1961. Both rebel groups agreed to peace talks after President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>'s announcement in June that the government had no preconditions and welcomed an independent observer.

 Carnegie Hall officials said Friday they are continuing to adjust the hall's acoustics to restore the sonic glory of the great hall that some critics said was lost in a 1986 interior renovation. Officials hope to have the work done in time for the 1989-90 music season, said Executive Director <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Arron </PERSON>. To introduce acoustical absorption within the mid - and high-frequency ranges, workers are spraying a cellulose acoustical material on the stage ceiling, and putting panels of 100 percent wool felt on the stage's back wall Second, sound-diffusing panels will be placed across the entire rear wall to control the reflection of sound from the wall back to the stage, <PERSON> Arron </PERSON> said.

 The former clerk of <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest court system, was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for corruption uncovered during the federal `` Operation Incubator'' probe. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, 63, stood silently with his arms folded across his chest as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Ilana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rovner </PERSON> sentenced him for taking bribes, threatening a witness and attempted extortion. <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> pleaded for leniency before the sentencing. `` I am sorry that I involved myself in this mess, not only for myself, but mostly for my wife and family,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Rovner </PERSON> ordered him to turn himself in to authorities on Oct. 23, pay $ 50,000 in fines and $ 25,000 in restitution for bribes he took. `` You and you alone took yourself from the pinnacle of power ... to stand here in a place you should only have visited in your official capacity,'' she said. `` It is obvious that your representation of all that occurred can only be characterized at best as skewed, and at worst as lies.'' The judge also said evidence that <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> had threatened an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent twice during the trial weighed heavily in the sentencing decision. Ms. <PERSON> Rovner </PERSON> and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphaelson </PERSON> said videotapes showing <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> taking $ 7,500 in cash were the most convincing evidence of his guilt. `` <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> sold the office of the clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> in no uncertain terms,'' <PERSON> Raphaelson </PERSON> said. `` Those tapes show what <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> is about.'' <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Garippo </PERSON>, maintained his client was enticed into taking the bribe. `` The money was there. It was shoved at him and he took the money,'' <PERSON> Garippo </PERSON> said. `` He is a good man who was drawn into something.'' The videotape, viewed during the trial, showed <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> mole <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> and former court investigator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambesis </PERSON> in <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>'s apartment having lunch with <PERSON> Finley </PERSON> on Dec. 4, 1985 <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> reaches beneath a kitchen apron to pull out a wad of money, and a hand identified as <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>'s extends into the frame of the film to accept it for help in obtaining a lucrative city contract.

<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state appeals court Friday overturned the first-degree assault conviction of an AIDS-infected inmate who bit a prison guard, but said there was enough evidence to support a lesser assault charge. In a 4-1 ruling, the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said there was insufficient evidence to uphold <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>'s conviction for first-degree assault and his 15-year sentence. But, the judges said, the facts supported a conviction on a lesser charge of third-degree assault. The appeals court sent the case back to <ORGANIZATION> Limestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> to be sentenced for third-degree assault, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum one year in jail. First-degree assault is a felony involving the use of a deadly weapon or a dangerous instrument to cause serious physical injury. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, 31, is confined in a special unit at the <ORGANIZATION> Limestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Capshaw </LOCATION> for inmates infected with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus. In January 1988, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> scuffled with Officer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> when <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> tried to remove prohibited ink pens from <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>'s cell. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was bitten on the arm, but three subsequent tests showed no traces of the AIDS virus. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> was charged with attempted murder in the first criminal case ever brought in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> involving a bite by a person infected with the AIDS virus, but a jury convicted him of a reduced charge of first-degree assault. The appeals court, in a ruling written by Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, said the state failed to prove that <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> used his mouth and teeth under circumstances `` highly capable of causing death or serious physical injury.'' `` This court can not take judicial notice that biting is a means capable of spreading AIDS. While AIDS may very well be transmitted through a human bite, there was no evidence to that effect at trial and we do not believe that is established scientific fact,'' the court ruled. The court said, however, that the state did prove elements of assault in the third degree. Under <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> law a person can be convicted of third-degree assault if, while trying to prevent a peace officer from performing his duty, the person causes physical injury to anyone. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> originally was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1977 for robbery and buying and receiving stolen property in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said.

 A gang of white teen-agers, out to block interracial dating in their neighborhood, shot and killed a black youth who happened along with three friends hoping to buy a used car, officials said Thursday. Police Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said at least 10 and as many as 30 white youths, armed with baseball bats and at least one gun, committed the killing. `` My son will never turn this corner again and it's only because of this _ the pigment of his skin,'' <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, father of the slain youth, said Thursday evening. `` This is what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has to learn _ that we no longer are going to take this. ... All we want is justice.'' The gang had gathered to waylay blacks or Hispanics they believed were headed for a birthday party for an 18-year-old girl, who recently had rejected her white boyfriend and had been dating black and Hispanic men, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The spurned boyfriend had threatened the girl and made racist comments to her, said Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON>. The jilted youth was part of the gang that attacked the slain teen-ager and his friends. The commissioner said the identity of the shooter was not known and the former boyfriend, known so far only by a street name, was being sought. <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, 16, was killed Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION>, a middle-class, largely Italian and Jewish residential neighborhood of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. Three white teen-agers had been taken into custody, but no charges had been filed Thursday, said Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and his friends entered the neighborhood to answer a newspaper ad about a car for sale. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said the whites followed the blacks for about a block and a half and that witnesses heard them say to each other: `` Are these the ones? Is this them?'' What they did n't know, according to <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON>, was that the girl had told her new boyfriend not to come and called off her birthday party. <PERSON> McGillion </PERSON> said the girl, whose identity was not divulged, saw the killing from her window. `` She knew there was going to be trouble. There were rumblings in he neighborhood. Her mother had looked out the window and saw the boys with the bats,'' she said. When the white gang stopped and confronted the blacks, four shots were heard. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> was hit twice in the chest. One of his companions suffered an arm injury and the other two were not hurt. The gang scattered after the shots. Police found four .32 - caliber shells and a bat at the scene, but no

 <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> plant won a $ 1.797 billion contract Thursday to produce 60 more external tanks to fuel the nation's space shuttle through mid-1997.

Each of the huge external tanks, 154 feet long and 28 feet in diameter, supplies more than 500,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen fuel and liquid oxygen oxidizer to the orbiter during lift-off and ascent. The super-cold propellants are fed to the orbiter's engines at a rate of 1,035 gallons per second, emptying the tank in about 8 -LCB- minutes. When loaded the tanks weigh 1.676 million pounds; when empty, 66,000 pounds. When loaded, the tank is the largest and heaviest part of the shuttle and its only major, non-reusable element. It is comprised of about 481,450 components. The first tank to be built under the new contract is to be completed by late 1991 and the last by mid-1997, the company said. Under previous contracts, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> has produced 52 of 59 external tanks.

 Two explosions ripped apart a grocery store that was recently the target of an arson fire, hurling debris nearly a block, and the ensuing blaze gutted three other businesses early Thursday, authorities said. The cause of the fire in the city's <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> district had not been determined, but arson investigators considered the blaze suspicious, said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` Somebody wants them out of here and I guess they succeeded this morning,'' <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. Twenty-six people were evacuated from <PERSON> Ma </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, a low-income hotel on the same block, <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. The residents were allowed to return about 9 a.m. Hotel manager <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said the sound of the first explosion awakened him. He was looking out his window when the second blast went off. `` I saw all this material flying across the street and a big ball of fire behind it,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. The explosion was centered at a grocery called Savmor Grub, also the location on July 22 of an arson fire that was started at about the same time in the morning. That fire caused $ 125,000 in damage, <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. He said agents from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> were called to assist in the investigation. Pieces of the damaged building were thrown at least half a block away. `` If someone had been walking by, they'd probably had got blown across the street,'' <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. The three businesses destroyed by fire were <PERSON> Demetri </PERSON>'s Grocery, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>'s Resale and the <ORGANIZATION> Portland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tattoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. No damage estimate was immediately available. The three-alarm fire broke out at 4:26 a.m. but was under control by 5:11 a.m., <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> said. A fire bureau investigator said the Savmor Grub building was owned by <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, but her residence was not known.

 Stock market analysts say the risk of a financial meltdown is far lower today than it was two years ago, the last time the Dow Jones industrial average was in record territory. The Dow Jones average of 30 key industrial company stocks jumped 56.53 points Thursday, carrying it to 2,734.64 and surpassing the record of 2,722.42 set precisely two years ago today. The 1987 peak was the start of a short but severe bear market that culminated in the worst day in Wall Street history, the 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials on Oct. 19, 1987. Evidence of that debacle was hard to find Thursday. Supporting the stock market in 1989 are a healthy dollar, relatively low interest rates and optimism that the economy will manage to steer a middle course between recession and high inflation.

 Four years ago in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Freelove </PERSON> had a plan: She wanted to meet <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and start a band with her. Around that same time, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> was mourning the demise of her previous group, <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joy </ORGANIZATION>, and longed to start another one. She and <PERSON> Freelove </PERSON> met and were soon playing guitar together at coffee houses. They performed <ORGANIZATION> Monkees </ORGANIZATION> songs, rock' n' roll, old movie tunes as well as their own material. They called themselves Two Nice Girls. A few months later, Freelove and <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> met <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Korniloff </PERSON> and were so pleased with how their voices and guitars sounded together they decided to add her to the group. The name? Two Nice Girls. `` That was my idea,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> explained. `` It beat the hell of out of The Jackson Five. Some friends of mine were in a band called Five Happy Guys. One of them left so they changed the name to The Happiness Crew. We were called Two Nice Girls and hired somebody else, but I did n't want to change the name.'' They are a major part of a lively <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> music scene that has attracted the attention of critics around the country. All three <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION>, however, grew up elsewhere. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> attended <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s High School for the Performing Arts and headed to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> after graduating. `` My first song was a duet that I wrote for my sister and I,'' she recalled. `` We would take baths together and it would take forever. The song went, ` 102, oo oo oo.. 107, 111.' That was it. Then we would take the washcloth and suck the water out of it. I had no idea what it was about.'' Freelove grew up in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and went to a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> girls' high school outside of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` I've been writing songs since I was this high,'' Freelove said. `` I used to have to vacuum and clean the house and I used to make up songs. I have tapes of almost everything I've done. I've got gobs of tapes of when I was a little guy. I was a much better songwriter when I was 13.'' <PERSON> Korniloff </PERSON>, the daughter of violinists, lived in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Scarsdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` My first song was a very, very sad love song about a boy who was supposed to my boyfriend who I caught with another girl. I was so devastated. I went upstairs to the attic of my house with my little guitar and played my heart out.'' Their debut album, `` 2 <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION>,'' features original songs from all three and a unique overlapping of <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>'s `` Sweet Jane'' and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>'s `` Love and Affection.'' The version on `` 2 <ORGANIZATION> Nice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION>'' was a live performance on an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> public radio station. `` We went on for an hour-long program called ` Live Set,''' <PERSON> Korniloff </PERSON> said. `` Our friends were all invited to be in the studio and lend that live clapping air to the show. `` We tried a couple of times to record the song in the studio, but we could never recapture vocally what we did that one time. As it turned out, the station still had the master copy on two-track which they let us use. They said, ` It's your performance; we only have the tape.''' The melodies and sweet harmonies make Two Nice Girls easy to listen to, but `` My Heart Crawls Off,'' written by <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickman </PERSON>, is a bitter song about jealousy. `` That's the power of being a songwriter,'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` I just wrote this horrible song about -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that's got a really lovely melody. If I just made another punk anthem called ` I Hate You,' it would n't be really effective.'' <PERSON> Freelove </PERSON> wrote `` Money,'' a long way from the Motown hit of the same title that proclaimed, `` The best things in life are free, but you can keep it for the bird and bees.'' Instead, <PERSON> Freelove </PERSON> warns against being `` a slave to money.'' `` It's about money and obsession and the ways it numbs you out,'' Freelove said. `` Money keeps many of us protected from distressing things, disturbing things. People who have money can shield themselves from observing the homeless.'' Their sound recalls The <PERSON> Roches </PERSON> and Indigo Girls. But what could have influenced <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' `` I Spent my Last Ten Dollars -LRB- on Birth Control and Beer -RRB-'' or `` The Holland Song,'' in which <PERSON> Korniloff </PERSON> sings, `` The Dutch are too much''? `` I do n't really think of these songs as song of experience, but songs of perspective,'' she said. `` I think that the content of the songs are much more about how life ought to be. What we'd like for it to be like. `` We consciously try to create a sense of community. It's more likely to save us from horribly depressing lives. You have some sort of good feelings. Bands are at an advantage, they're capable of doing that.''

 <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> is a man who likes to bring his work home, but this is the first chance he's had to do that in more than 40 years. This historic village on the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast where <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>'s acting career began is the backdrop for the season opener for his television series `` Matlock.'' `` I always wanted to bring a show here,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said recently in a break from filming. `` I thought it would be good for the town and good for the company.'' A native of Mount Airy and graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Chapel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> put fictional <PERSON> Mayberry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on the map. That was in his popular TV series `` The <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show'' and yet, he said, the producers of that show saw no point in taping in the state because people already believed it was done here. When <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> suggested filming an episode of `` Matlock'' in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, he had no trouble persuading the producers. `` We took a flight down here and fell in love,'' said supervising producer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. `` He loved the show so much he brought it home. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> puts himself totally into this, especially in this episode. These are his people and his friends.'' The two-hour show, which will air on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 19, was filmed entirely on and around <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the first English colonists landed and where <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> has had a home for more than 30 years. The episode, `` The Hunting Party,'' has <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> called to defend a man accused of killing a member of his brother's hunting group. <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> discovers a hostile environment that may hinder a fair trial. About 20 local residents were hired for the crew and dozens as extras in the cast. `` This is a valentine from <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> for the whole community,'' said <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON>, whose family has been friends with <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> since he played Sir <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Raleigh </PERSON> for five summers in the outdoor musical drama, `` The Lost Colony.'' During the `` Matlock'' taping, art sometimes imitated life. In the closing scene, the crowd cheered as <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON>, a big city lawyer from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, emerged victorious from the courthouse. Ms. <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON> and a handful of her relatives, who play themselves, descend on <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> for photos as part of the scene. `` Smile,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON>'s 79-year-old mother, <PERSON> Cora </PERSON> <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON>, as she is pushed next to <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> for a pose to complete the scene. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> came up to the house and asked me ` did I like to play in it' and I said ` yes,''' explained Mrs. <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON>, whose late husband, Saint <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> were good friends. `` Daddy also went barefoot around town and so did <PERSON> Andy </PERSON>,'' recalled Saint <PERSON> Clair </PERSON> <PERSON> Basnight </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who has a few speaking lines in the show. `` Two or three times a year you see him -LRB- <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> -RRB- in town, in the hardware store. ... To him, I think this is home. He's never lost touch. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> made sure a lot of the local flavor shows through in the episode. Beach scenes were shot in Nags Head, while other segments were shot at the Lost Colony Theater and along the <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> waterfront. <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said playing <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> has been the highlight of his career, which has included characters ranging from the bumbling <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockwell </PERSON> in the comedy film `` No Time For Sergeants'' to Sheriff <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> in `` The <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show.'' `` It's the best role I ever played,'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was a wonderful character, and it was the best experience of my professional life.'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, who has added former co-star <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Knotts </PERSON> to the `` Matlock'' cast, said `` The <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> Show'' provided him eight years of `` fine creative experience.'' But he said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> do n't have that much in common, except that `` both come out of my innards.'' `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was a very, very good man,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Matlock </PERSON> is a good man, but he wants to win. He's very shrewd.'' <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON>, who expects `` Matlock'' to end after its fifth season, plans to make <LOCATION> Manteo </LOCATION> his permanent home and use it as a work base. `` <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> _ <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> loves him,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. `` He's got this tremendous following. He's one of those stars who have endured and endeared.''

<HEAD>Rail Trails Slow to Catch on in Indiana</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hoosiers trying to join a nationwide movement to turn railroad corridors into long, narrow parks for hiking and biking are being blocked just like a busy street by a slow-moving freight train. `` <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is surrounded by states that are really taking a lead on these rails-to-trails programs,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harnik </PERSON> of the Washington-based Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. `` I'd say Hoosiers are missing a great opportunity.'' At least seven <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> cities _ <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hobart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chesterton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> LaPorte </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION> _ are trying to create linear parks from unused railroad rights-of-way; the <ORGANIZATION> Hoosier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rails-to-Trails </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is lobbying <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> officials to turn one into a trail through the city. Most cities are short on the money to develop trails. In others, residents express concern about the effects of a surge in recreational visitors. However, advocates say crime goes down and the local economy improves when tourists flock to well-kept rail trails. `` We're missing the boat financially,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Paynter </PERSON>, treasurer of the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> group. `` We're missing the boat recreationally.'' In 1916, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had the largest railroad system in the world with more than 250,000 miles of track. As trucks, planes, buses and cars began to take over, railroads merged, consolidated their routes and shut down. Nationwide, railroads each year abandon more than 3,000 miles of track. The President's Commission on Americans Outdoors recommended turning the corridors into paths for hiking, biking and horseback riding. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year passed the National Trails System Improvement Act, requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to encourage such conversion. As of January, 32 states had created 2,700 miles of rail trails with an average length of 13.3 miles, according to the Rails-to-Trails Conservancy. The leaders include <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, with 18 trails totaling 443 miles; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, with 20 measuring 203 miles; and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, with 11 totaling 142 miles. In <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, more than 2,400 miles of tracks lie unused. Highland leaders envision a 2 -LCB- - mile trail cutting diagonally across the northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> city, which has gained use of two abandoned rights-of-way The 200-foot-wide corridor is being developed piecemeal during a search for contractors willing to level it in exchange for the materials there. `` There is a market for that if you are willing to not do it all at once. To date it has n't cost us anything, but all we have to show for it is a half-mile section,'' said <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> and Recreation Superintendent <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAtley </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, planners wanting to use two abandoned railways _ the <LOCATION> Elgin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> _ to link four parks are stalled in negotiations over price. The five-mile trails would intersect in an `` X'' and allow residents to ride to all four corners of the northwestern city. <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> wants to create a five-mile trail along a Monon corridor that goes south into <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. The railroad wants $ 965,000, but <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON> said, `` That's not anything we would pay or think about paying The city hopes to start next summer by opening a one-mile path. Meanwhile, attorneys are researching the railroad's title to the rest of the corridor. <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> McDermott </PERSON> wants to develop 4 -LCB- miles of the Erie <LOCATION> Lackawanna </LOCATION> into an urban trail that might eventually link the northwestern city to nearby <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Chesterton </LOCATION>. `` We're encountering some heavy opposition by the <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> because they're not willing to put up any money to develop it,'' said planner <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehner </PERSON>. `` They do n't see it as an amenity or an economic tool, which it definitely can be.'' In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, a coalition of 600 businesses and other supporters have tried to persuade officials to create a trail in the Monon corridor that once carried people to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The city bought it from <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> with an $ 800,000 loan from the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. If it is used for mass transit within 10 years, the city does not have to repay the money. A trail would not meet that provision. Other options include a high-speed bus line, a monorail or an elevated train. A series of public hearings will be held to determine the best use, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Arland </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudnut </PERSON>. `` We want that corridor to be used for whatever the majority of people want it to be used for.'' That process can take years, and trail advocates are becoming impatient. `` It can be done. They all forget the process needs to be continuously reactivated in their minds,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kress </PERSON>, a planner with the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Trails are a long-time investment and a long-time commitment is needed to them.''

 <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' most celebrated prostitute lay in her coffin surrounded by flowers as faded as the era, and admired by two men as jaded as the times. Manouche's wake in the plush red parlor of the bordello is the beginning, not the end, of a friendship that introduces the soon-to-be scandalous author <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to the hedonistic pleasures of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> in the 1930s. `` As you know it is a little my fault,'' chuckles renowned French film director <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON>, puffing on a pipe as he surveyed his gaudy vision of a prewar French cathouse. `` I wanted to make a film on sex for a long time. I did n't o it because I had other projects.'' <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON> fulfills his fantasy in `` Clichy Days,'' a film adapted from the baudy autobiographical novel `` Quiet Days in Clichy'' by the author of `` Tropic of Cancer'' and `` Tropic of Capricorn.'' The film is being shot on location in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and in a studio at Cinecitta, the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. It is intended for release next summer. `` I must say it is interesting now to make a film about sex because I think after the liberation of sexuality in the'70s it was very, very childish. Now it seems to be a little more puritanical than before. So I think now is a good moment to say that you can speak of sex without it being a dirty thing,'' <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON> said. `` Another thing that is very interesting is the period, the 1930s. It is in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the beginning of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, ... and I must say the intellectuals in general and the American intellectuals in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at that time did n't see anything. They were n't interested in those things at all. I would like to show the character here who tries to find his own freedom, his own lucidity and despite that he does n't see what happens beside him.'' <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON> cast 26-year-old <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> in the role of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who at 42 was discovering the bohemian lifestyle of prewar <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, indifferent to the sorrows of the Depression at home and to the signs of impending war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Well, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. You do n't get a chance to be <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> very often,'' said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who became a hero of the bubble-gum set in such critical bombs as `` St. Elmo's Fire.'' `` He is a notorious rogue. It is a lot of fun. I think it is fun because of <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON>.'' `` I think he has an amazing knowledge of the cinema,'' added <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Havers </PERSON>, the British actor who plays <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON>, the friend who introduces <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> to his new life in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` He shoots exactly what he wants and he knows exactly what he wants. It is a wonderful way of working.'' <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON>'s way of working has changed a lot since the young critic for Cahiers du Cinema led the New Wave of <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> directors with his first film, `` <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Beau </PERSON> <PERSON> Serge </PERSON>,'' in 1958. He gained international fame over the next few years with `` Les Cousins'' in 1959 and `` Les Bonnes Femmes'' in 1960. He suffered a string of commercially inspired critical failures in the early 1960s, but later regained his reputation with such films as `` Les Biches'' and `` La Femme Infidele.'' `` You know, I have made too many films now, even too many bad films. Now I'm almost an old man and I just do what I like. ... That's all. `` I'm not sure all my films will be good now, but I am sure I want to do them. It was not exactly the same thing in the past. Sometimes I accepted things,'' said the 59-year-old filmmaker. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s `` Quiet Days in <LOCATION> Clichy </LOCATION>,'' he said, offered him the chance to do at once the film on sex and several other projects he had in mind. `` I had read it and remembered it as very well-written but really almost a pornographic book. But I read it -LRB- again -RRB- and found exactly the things I wanted to make,'' he said. `` Two years ago I had an idea to make a film about the American intellectuals, especially those in the'30s. I had at the same time another idea to make a film about a young girl of about 14.'' The little girl is <PERSON> Colette </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Stephania </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotta </PERSON>, the 15-year-old granddaughter of Manouche who ends up living with <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON> and co-writer <PERSON> Ugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonzio </PERSON> used the book as the basis, but not a script, for their screenplay. `` If your read <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s book ... it is really trashy. He always changes reality. He changes it to garbage. And it is not ... the truth. I do n't like that so I changed the reality, too. `` But on the other side,'' said <PERSON> Chabrol </PERSON>, `` that is why we have big sets and too beautiful things. They are the other side of the lie.''

 <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> cursed the smooth-as-glass water in a 35-acre pothole on his farm, even though he knew it made a rich wildlife breeding area. `` That depression does no good for me except it might raise a pair of ducks,'' he said. `` As a farmer, it's no good for me.'' <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> wo n't be draining this wetland, even though he has all the permits he needs. Instead, next winter, he'll haul dirt onto the ice-covered pond so when spring arrives, mounds will sprout to produce ideal nesting habitat for ducks. <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>'s change of heart comes at a price. He and some neighbors are negotiating an agreement with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that could pay them up to $ 40 an acre to raise ducks. Their willingness to negotiate, officials say, represents a real breakthrough in relations that could end the wetlands war, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s most controversial environmental issue. `` The signal, I think, is that Wildlife is able to sit down at the table, not demanding that every wetland be preserved, and agriculture is saying, ` We do n't want to drain and are willing to save some,''' said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, state game and fish commissioner and former director of wetlands habitat for the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` That is something that did n't happen in the history of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and is happening now.'' Unlike other states, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> does not have serious problems with dirty water and air. In fact, other than draining wetlands, the biggest environmental concern looming for the state is how to get rid of its garbage. The wetlands war has pitted landowners against wildlife interests, but the ramifications move the issue closer to urban consumers by affecting the quality of the wildlife habitat and water available for outdoor recreation. Before settlers pushed onto the prairie, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> had 5 million acres of wetlands, marshy land teeming with wildlife. Just 2 million acres remain, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, and he is determined to preserve them. `` We are seeing a lot of things go wrong with 2 million acres and we ca n't get by with anything less,'' he said. Wetlands act as a natural filter, concentrating fertilizer and other runoff, then releasing more polluted water into lakes and streams. Draining the bowl-like indentations dotting the prairie in eastern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> has disrupted the area's hydrology and removed natural storage tanks, increasing the chances of flooding, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. It also removed natural habitat for ducks and geese. The drainage was spurred by farmers' desire to plant on some of their most fertile soil. The federal government even paid them at one time to drain their sloughs. `` There was a strong public attitude that wetlands were wastelands,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Through the 1970s, farmers drained about 20,000 acres a year. By 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> passed a law requiring that each acre drained had to be replaced, the so-called no-net-loss policy, which took effect July 1. `` I am real optimistic that the future for wetlands has never been better in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` People are getting along a lot better now. People trust each other a lot more now.'' Not everyone shares that optimism. `` I do n't know if there is a final solution,'' said <LOCATION> Ramsey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Stromme </PERSON>. Landowners in his area remain unhappy with the no-net-loss law and want it repealed; they are disgusted that the federal government obtains land without paying full taxes on it, he sid. State Rep. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Berg </PERSON> _ whose critics call him `` Mr. <PERSON> Draino </PERSON>'' for his support of wetland drainage _ says landowners must be paid for their potholes. `` If you do n't have the cooperation of the farmer, you've got nothing.'' <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McEnroe </PERSON> of the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has been negotiating with <PERSON> Horne </PERSON> and 29 other landowners for preservation of 1,500 acres of wetlands in return for payments of $ 15 to $ 40 an acre. The exact amounts are still being discussed, but an agreement could be signed within two months, he said. `` Rather than fight with people, we figured we would be much better off working toward the middle ground,'' <PERSON> McEnroe </PERSON> said. `` We are going kind of slow on this one because we want to find out how much it costs. If it will work up here on a draining project of this size, I think it can work anywhere.'' <PERSON> Horne </PERSON>, driving around his land northwest of <LOCATION> Devils </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, said the roads and trees have disrupted wetlands as much as draining potholes. His agreement with the government will let him drain some of the smaller sloughs in return for preserving and enhancing the larger, more valuable ones. `` I'll be your local in-house manager, and we will raise birds or whatever,'' he said. `` But I want to get paid for it.''

<BYLINE>For Airline Stocks, How High Is Up? ^By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Whatever else happens in the stock market over the next few months, 1989 will go into the history books as the year the airlines took wing on Wall Street. Takeover bids for the parent companies of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> have played a large part in transforming an industry long spurned by many investors into one of the hottest stock groups around. That helped <PERSON> Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>'s average of 20 transportation stocks reach new peaks weeks before the 30-stock industrial average did so last week. But there's more to the story than that. And with all its positive and profitable moments, some analysts say it could still have an unhappy ending. Nobody disputes that solid business reasons exist for the air transport industry's newfound popularity. Traffic, fares and profits are up for most major carriers. The era of bitter price competition that followed airline deregulation in the late 1970s appears to be over. From its competitors' point of view, the strike that began in March at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> `` has made a bright situation even brighter,'' observed the Value Line Investment Survey in its latest quarterly report on the group. `` Pulling Eastern's 6 percent capacity out of the system has produced a very favorable environment for raising airline fares,'' wrote Value Line analyst <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. Airline stock enthusiasts cite several other pluses: Many airlines are described as better managed now than they used to be, and the use of lease financing enables them to expand and modernize their fleets much more easily. On top of all that, the carriers have come to be seen as attractive to lenders and investors for the assets they own. That's where some skeptics begin to voice their reservations about all the bidding and borrowing that has been taking place. An airline is simply the wrong kind of company to qualify as a good candidate for a buyout financed with debt, argues <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> in his newsletter <PERSON> Grant </PERSON>'s Interest Rate Observer. Airlines have heavy capital-spending requirements and unions to deal with _ and their business has always been very sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy. `` Every airline is a prisoner of the business cycle and a hostage to the price of fuel,'' <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> says. `` We see in the airline lift-off yet another example of debt in action, making the good times better and casting a shadow over the future. We suspect that easy credit will sooner or later give way to hard, or inaccessible, credit.'' Adds <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> at Value Line: `` We're concerned about the value being placed on these airline properties. `` Interest expense, for example, on borrowings to finance the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> buyout will basically wipe out the carrier's earnings in 1990. That's not an encouraging performance in the strong operating environment we're forecasting for next year. `` In a recession, if one of these debt-laden carriers were to stumble badly, we fear it could get quite messy. `` Moreover, much of the alleged asset value in an airline -LRB- e.g., lucrative route franchises -RRB- can normally only be tapped by breaking up the company. Few unions will sit idly by while the dismantling is taking place. `` We think airline stock performance will be very volatile in the next several months,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> concluded. `` Accordingly, we advise conservative investors to take refuge on the sidelines with those individuals who do n't buy the airline-merger story.''

<TEXT>
 A 20-pound badger killed on a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> highway is spending the hereafter stuffed in a fierce pose, mounted on wheels and racing hither and yon trying to scare some sense into overly friendly ferrets. He's called `` Robo-Badger'' by his handlers from the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, who hope his radio-controlled scare tactics will help ferrets reared in captivity learn to protect themselves from predators when they are returned to the wild. If <PERSON> Robo-Badger </PERSON>'s menacing lunges are n't enough to instill fear, zoo conservationists pelt the puzzled ferrets with rubber bands, whose harmless stings usually encourage them to dive into the nearest hole. Another fear-inspiring weapon is a stuffed owl with outstretched wings that swoops down on a hand-operated pulley and string to buzz the sleek, furry ferrets as they scamper over a dirt mound. Here in the foothills of the <LOCATION> Blue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> about 80 miles west of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, at a former training camp for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> cavalry troops, scientists are conducting `` predator-avoidance training'' for ferrets at an outpost of the National Zoo that is dedicated to saving endangered wildlife from extinction. Wildlife biologist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> says his project at the zoo's <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is aimed at ensuring the survival of the North American black-footed ferret, which he calls `` one of the most endangered mammals in the world. Hundreds of thousands of these ferrets, the chief predators of prairie dogs, once lived in the vast arid grasslands of the West, from southern <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to northern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. But they fell victim to agricultural development and the federal government's program to eradicate grass-eating prairie dogs as a threat to the livelihood of cattle ranchers. Deprived of their main source of food as well as shelter in prairie dog burrows, the ferrets rapidly fell prey to disease and other predators such as great horned owls, golden eagles and badgers. By 1985, only 10 black-footed ferrets remained, all of them in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. They were quickly removed to the safety of captivity, where breeding was begun. Today, says <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, there are 120 black-footed ferrets at the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> game and fish research center at <LOCATION> Sybille </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Doorly </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoo </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION>. `` They were raised in captivity and they know nothing about predators,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They have never seen a badger. Will they duck when they see one? Will they run into a hole? It's one thing to be afraid, and another thing to know what to do. We want them to get into that hole as quickly as possible.'' Enter Robo-Badger. The badger was a road kill found lying alongside a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> highway. At <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s request, it was hustled into a freezer and shipped across the country to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> taxidermist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhymer </PERSON> transformed it into a battery-operated robot. Stuffed with ears bent back and front paws clawing as if chasing a prey, the badger was mounted on the chassis of a toy truck with miniature tractor wheels and a tiny, red-tipped antenna for receiving radioed stop-and-go and directional commands. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> is experimenting first with 50 Siberian polecats, more populous first cousins of black-footed ferrets from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> which were bred from stock imported from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Zoo. In the first couple months of testing, the Siberian ferrets seem mostly curious about Robo-Badger, but more frightened by the swooping owl. Once he has determined what ferrets know instinctively from their `` genetic memory'' about self-protection, feeding, digging into burrows and other necessities in the wild, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> will know what training in captivity is required to prepare the black-footed variety for its return to the wild. If the black-footed ferrets make a comeback there, he said, other species of plant and animal life _ birds, insects, small mammals and shrubs _ may also flourish and help restore what was once a `` rich oasis of diversity'' in the ecosystem of prairie dog communities. Working in collaboration with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> game and fish officials and experts at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> hopes to give the ferrets their freedom in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Absoroka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> adjacent to Yellowstone Park sometime in 1991, if the current population of 57 adults has grown to 200 by then. `` They've had a pretty hard time,'' he said. `` They deserve the best shot we can give them.''

<HEAD>NRA Pushing Itself into a Corner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s best friends are worried that the gun lobby may be shooting itself in the foot. A conservative editor and activist says <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> absolutism has kept it from cooperating with some of its natural allies, among them conservative groups, police organizations and, in some cases, Republicans. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON>, writing in Policy Review, a journal published by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, says that has cut into <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> political clout and put the organization on the defensive. `` Many of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s current difficulties are the result of self-inflicted wounds,'' he writes. `` During the past few years, the organization has refused to play coalition politics with its natural allies in the conservative movement including, most especially, elements of organized law enforcement. `` A go-it-alone approach and a refusal to compromise on less than critical issues is jeopardizing the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s effectiveness in winning political support on those issues that it considers most important.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has been skirmishing with the Republican administration in recent months over the government's decision to ban the importing of 43 types of semiautomatic assault weapons. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed that order July 7. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering legislation that would impose new restrictions on U.S.-made assault weapons. After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the permanent ban on imports, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> said some of its members wanted to kick him out of the organization. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said during the 1988 campaign that he opposed federal gun control, is a lifetime member of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman said he intended to remain one. When the question of city or state gun controls came up Wednesday at an informal news conference in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the people of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> should decide for themselves. `` The Constitution gives you certain rights in that regard,'' he added. `` What I want to get is strong support for our anti-crime package, stronger predictable sentencing, tougher terms, more judges, more people to make those pay who are breaking the law.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> also took on <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, who had recommended the ban. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> lawyer, wrote that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen would be deprived of their right to bring home assault weapons, and suggested <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> might not understand because he was in graduate school during the height of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. `` While you may not be familiar with the life of a serviceman, for many of these men the chance to bring home firearms while posted overseas is small recompense for the isolation, the boredom and the risk of overseas duty,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> wrote. There have been more concrete <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> rebukes to the Republicans and the administration. <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> and other gun-owners' groups contributed to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> loss of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat once held by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and sat out a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> special election narrowly won by the Republicans `` This double punishment of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> probably served a useful purpose _ encouraging the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to refocus its drug strategies more on crime control than on gun control,'' <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> writes. `` But it also weakened the party that has been most sympathetic to the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> overall, and showed a spitefulness toward the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, with which it probably should be cooperating, not fighting.'' <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> also complains that the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> refused to join forces with conservatives working for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s nomination to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 `` As one of the strategists who sought to secure <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>'s confirmation, I know we badly needed the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s help and did n't get it.'' <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> apparently was unwilling to help <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> for fear that he would oppose the suppression of evidence obtained during investigations and searches that might involve firearms dealers. He also quotes an <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> official as saying the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> did n't want an early endorsement of <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> from the controversial gun group. But by his account, other single-interest conservative groups took up the <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> campaign even though their positions and his were not in total accord. `` By failing to admit the possibility of regulations that do not limit the basic right to bear arms, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is cutting itself off from a broader movement of judicial reform,'' <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> says. He says the organization may be moving in that direction now. His Heritage Foundation piece reads like an effort to encourage just that. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s voters will give strong support to a political coalition that can push through reform measures to keep dangerous offenders off the streets,'' <PERSON> McGuigan </PERSON> concludes. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> can play a very important role in this coalition, and in so doing channel gun control into its proper direction.''

 A $ 6.2 billion offer for the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is the biggest takeover yet proposed by <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, but the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> billionaire, ex-wildcatter and glitzy deli owner has other deals cooking, too. Even as <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> awaited <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s response this past week, his close-knit group searched for other undervalued companies and eyeballed <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a possible hunting ground. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' son <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> MBA whose computer research backs up his father's business instincts, said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is looking abroad now that so many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have been bought or dissected by the 1980s takeover frenzy. He suggested that Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s $ 21 billion offer for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> may set the agenda for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and other investors. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> now is where this country was in 1980,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 34. His father, 63, faces probable counteroffers for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and the team of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> investment firm He declined to be interviewed. But in written responses to questions from the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, he said the greatest threat to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy `` is in our failing to recognize that we are, today, in a truly global economy.'' `` American companies will have to be intensely competitive to succeed in the years to come,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` They will have to be managed by the best trained and motivated people, provided with a steady flow of capital and operate without any illusion about the fact that we are no longer the pre-eminent force in many industries.'' Neither father nor son will reveal exactly where they are looking next, though <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said newspapers, magazines, television stations, and hotel-casino outfits ca n't be ruled out. At 6-foot-5 and about 300 pounds, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is known as a fierce dealmaker and one of the world's wealthiest businessmen, estimated to be worth $ 1.7 billion by Fortune magazine. He seems unlikely to lose the fascination with glamour industries he has shown since cashing out of the oil business in the early'80s just before the industry slumped. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s `` Mr. Wildcatter'' in the 1970s, paying huge commissions to top geologists while convincing other oil companies to absorb much of the risk and cost for the drilling. He purchased 20th <ORGANIZATION> Century </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 720 million, most of it borrowed, with a partner in 1981, then bought singer <PERSON> Kenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> estate, `` The Knoll,'' for more than $ 20 million. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> faltered under his leadership, partly because of flops like `` Rhinestone'' -LRB- <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> teamed with <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, who played a singing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cab driver -RRB-. But when <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> sold to <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> after four years, he netted $ 325 million. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has unsuccessfully pursued such high-profile companies as <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and, this year, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He teamed with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to snag <ORGANIZATION> Spectradyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a big provider of pay-per-view movies in hotel rooms, for $ 635 million. He paid $ 136 million to the family of now-convicted speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> in December 1986 to buy the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, the pink landmark where he had honeymooned with his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. Within a year, he sold the hotel to the Sultan of <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, the world's wealthiest person, for a $ 65 million profit. Although <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> generally avoids the press, he seems to have a hankering for <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> happenings and celebrity friends. When he opened his <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> version of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deli </LOCATION> in July, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretzky </PERSON> watched as <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Channing </PERSON> plopped a monster matzo ball into a vat of chicken soup. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> acknowledges the family wo n't be looking much at industries `` unless they are fun.'' `` We probably wo n't buy a chemical company,'' he said. At any given time, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' group is analyzing two or three industries where undervalued companies may be found, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. He said the airline industry was targeted because it had stabilized after the trauma of deregulation. The Davis group especially liked <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> because of their strength in the booming <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> region. More often than not, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has profited enormously by buying stock in a company, making a buyout offer that raises the price, then selling his stake to a higher bidder. For example, he initially offered $ 2.7 billion to buy <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> but eventually was outbid by investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>'s $ 3.65 billion deal in June. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made $ 30 million. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> insists the <ORGANIZATION> Davises </ORGANIZATION> seriously want to buy when they bid, and bid only after rigorous analysis. `` We've spent too much time and effort on the airlines industry _ 2 -LCB- years of work and millions and millions and millions of dollars worth of bank fees, consultant fees, investment banking fees, legal fees,'' he said. `` You know we would n't have spent all this money if we were just interested in putting a company in play and making a profit.'' Likewise, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> counters critics who say he and other takeover strategists are motivated by greedy speculation rather than long-term investment goals. `` We are businessmen and builders,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` We started with an industrial base, building and developing a major oil and gas exploration company. The companies we have bought _ for example <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skiing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pebble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ have been expanded and enhanced under our ownership. ... `` Equally important, our companies are contributing citizens of the communities in which they operate _ from a philanthropic, social and economic point of view,'' he said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' own philanthropy is extensive. He established the Children's <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and the lavish Carousel Ball that supports it. His donations to the foundation, the <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Childhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diabetes </ORGANIZATION>, a geriatrics care facility in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and a research center at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> total tens of millions of dollars. But if his generosity has made many friends, his sharp business instincts have, perhaps inevitably, bred conflict. Former 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanfill </PERSON> resigned soon after <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> bought <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, claiming interference. He filed a $ 40 million breach-of-contract suit, later settled out of court.

 The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> is fast shedding its role as solely a trading bloc of West European nations to assume a more prominent place in foreign affairs. The dozen nations that make up the community, also known as the Common Market, are virtually certain to take more political stands as their economies become tightly linked at the end of 1992, analysts say. That may well mean a diminished role for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and perhaps beyond, they say. `` It's a bit inevitable that where the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was once the only and therefore dominant initiator and influence in these matters, it will be an equal or one of many nations,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fieldhouse </PERSON>, research fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Encouraging the European closeness is the drive by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> to remove by Dec. 31, 1992, the many trade barriers separating the members. The aim of 1992 is to create a single market in which people, money, goods and services can move freely among member nations <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The 12 nations, with a whopping 320 million consumers, can wield much more economic power together than individually _ so too in world affairs. `` The completion of the internal market will undoubtedly have external implications,'' said <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Clercq </PERSON>, who formerly was the community's top foreign affairs official. `` The object of the game is not just economic integration,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludlow </PERSON>, director of the Center for <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, a Brussels-based think tank. `` -LRB- It -RRB- is only part of a general design to create a European union.'' `` Some measure of greater political cooperation will be had... How and to what degree all depends on the shape of economic integration,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the EEC. A recent poll by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the community's executive body, indicated that 72 percent of the Europeans questioned felt the community should handle foreign policy issues A little more than half said it should also decide security and defense matters. `` You ca n't exclude closer cooperation in security questions if you really want to realize a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Goerens </PERSON>, president of the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a forum for foreign and defense ministers that discusses security issues. With their unity push, Western Europeans are gaining a stronger sense of identity and becoming less dependent on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, long their protector against a possible threat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appears more willing, at least to analysts on this side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, to give up its once-supreme position in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the Western military alliance. They point in part to increased grumbling in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that Americans are paying too much _ and Europeans not enough _ of the costs for the common Western defense. With the federal budget crunch, there will be more pressure to pare the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contribution. They also note President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s endorsement of the European bonding. `` Let me say clearly a stronger <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a more united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, is good for my country,'' he said in a July speech in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. `` And it's a development we welcome, a natural evolution within our alliance, the product of true partnership 40 years in the making.'' The community's world standing got an unexpected lift in July when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and leaders of other rich democracies put it in charge of coordinating economic aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The move, which delighted community officials, was seen as a sign of their growing importance. `` It was a brilliant stroke on the part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kingon </PERSON>. Community spokesman <PERSON> Claus-Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehlermann </PERSON> said the assignment was `` certainly the biggest boost and also the greatest challenge'' for the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> in foreign relations. `` We have never been charged -LRB- before -RRB- with coordinating the activities of countries outside the 12.''

<TEXT>
 Officials of two dozen Western nations met in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in early August to take an initial look at ways to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The talks produced pledges of emergency food aid to shortage-plagued <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. More discussions will be held in the fall. The community was given the job most likely because of its contacts with the East. It has shown a keen interest in taking advantage of the changes under way in its East bloc neighbors to strengthen economic and political ties. In June 1988, it signed a declaration establishing official relations with the Soviet-led economic bloc, called the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION>, also known by the acronym <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION>. It brought to an end three decades of estrangement between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s economic halves Since then, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has signed or initialed trade agreements with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Negotiations are under way with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. At a summit in June, the leaders of the 12 member countries made known their desire to play an active role in encouraging reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They also acted together to sanction <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for its crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators and urged a negotiated solution to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> conflict. Earlier in the year, they recalled their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to protest the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s appeal for the death of the author <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who holds British citizenship. That action was agreed on at a regular monthly meeting of foreign ministers, gatherings that have become an important feature of community life. The governments also coordinate their views by issuing statements, under the title European Political Cooperation, on the troubles of the day, whether in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. A tiny EPC office, opened in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> in 1987, issues about four or five statements a month. `` The 12 have a common position in almost every single problem in the world,'' said one community official. Yet, it's unclear how much farther the community can go. Further steps might be limited if neutral <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, bridging the East and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, were to join. In a recent letter applying for membership, the Austrian government insisted on safeguarding its neutrality. Even so, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has expressed concern. EEC membership would not be exclusively economic, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> said. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, which entered the community in 1973, also is neutral. Its status has not yet been troublesome, although it might be were the community to expand forcefully into defense and security matters. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, unlike other community members, does not belong to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. The Western <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was revived in 1984 to bring together European foreign and defense ministers to tackle security issues. Defense chiefs do not meet within the EEC. Acting through the union in 1987, the nations sent naval minesweeping forces to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in the Iran-Iraq war. `` We have to become the European pillar of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Goerens </PERSON>, who is also a <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> legislator. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> are members of the organization. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> will join shortly. All belong to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Back to School: Beefing Up Security to Curb Violence, Protect Computers</HEAD>

 More guards, high-tech security devices and drug-sniffing dogs will greet children in urban and rural schools alike this fall as officials struggle to curb spreading violence and vandalism. Security budgets have doubled, even tripled in many districts in recent years, and now total in the hundreds of millions of dollars nationwide, a 50-state check by The Associated Press found. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> alone, with its 1,000 schools and nearly 1 million pupils, will spend $ 60 million on security this coming school year, double what it spent eight years ago. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the second largest district, spends $ 26 million. The spending relates not just to weapons, gangs and drugs, but also to the high-tech revolution that has loaded schools with VCRs and computers that need protection. `` The more we get into computers and things of that sort, equipment that is really expensive, naturally we want to protect that,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Randall </PERSON>, assistant superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Greenwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, which recently installed sophisticated burglar alarms. Some districts still insist school life is as peaceful as ever. `` We have none of those kinds of problems you read about in the big cities,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Zema </PERSON>, attorney for the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, school district where security is n't even an identifiable item in the budget. But elsewhere, drug and gang problems are finally forcing formerly placid school districts to hire guards and install sophisticated security hardware. Some officials now worry that such measures may make their schools feel like prisons or armed camps. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanebuth </PERSON>, head of the Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` a little unnerving'' to think local schools might resemble <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s or <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s. But with 15 teachers assaulted by students last school year, he and other Alabamians seem to agree sterner security measures are in order. `` It's gotten beyond the day of just the fire drill. We've got to be prepared for the extreme because that's what we face,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and Supervision which began security workshops last year. `` We're deliberately trying to avoid letting our schools become armed camps,'' said <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, director of security for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>' schools, which nonetheless will add a drug-sniffing dog this year to its arsenal of hand-held metal detectors, top-of-the-line locks, high fences and burglar alarms No figures exist on how much the nation's schools spend each year on security. But a check of districts in all 50 states found the figure is certainly in the hundreds of millions of dollars. `` We do know that the trend is up, and it's related to drug activity and gangs, and possession of weapons,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Pepperdine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school district, which includes <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, will spend $ 10.3 million on security for the 1989-90 school year, about $ 1.8 million more than last year, and $ 4 million more than five years ago, said <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, director of investigations. <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> will spend $ 10.4 million, nearly double the $ 5.5 million spent in the 1983-84 school year. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> will spend $ 2.2 million on safety this school year and may start using metal detectors, said school committee member <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON>. `` We have real concerns for this coming school year. The gang problem and guns on the street find their way to the schools,'' <PERSON> Nucci </PERSON> said. Ninety-seven percent of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s $ 60 million school security budget is for guards, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Irushalmi </PERSON>, director of the office of school safety. The city also plans to introduce metal detectors into 15 schools, up from five. <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where a third-grader was raped last year, has hired eight new security employees and will issue photo IDs to all elementary and intermediate staff who travel to schools. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s school system, the nation's third largest, spends $ 12.5 million a year and has 723 security positions. The <LOCATION> Muskogee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, district hired two part-time security guards last year for about $ 30,000 after a student with a handgun accidentally wounded a fellow student in a high school class. Little Rock, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, officials say they plan to raise the profile of security officers and possibly use a drug-sniffing dog following last year's shooting death of a student on a junior high basketball court. Officials insist all this spending is creating safer, more secure schools. <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, school security director of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, said vandalism losses dropped from $ 500,000 to $ 80,000 with the help of an electronic surveillance alarm system. In <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, school officials claim burglaries and vandalism have declined by 50 percent since the installation of state-of-the-art security systems featuring motion detectors. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Irushalmi </PERSON> says the number of violent or serious incidents has decreased from 15,500 to 9,000 since security spending doubled. Some argue still more spending is needed as gang violence and the crack epidemic spread. `` Many districts are not getting new money to handle these issues. Yet more and more is being asked of us,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Blauvelt </PERSON>, school security chief of <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directors </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, which includes <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, wanted to raise property taxes to increase its school security staff from 22 to 40 officers following a school year marred by gang violence, the murder of a high school student and the rape and kidnapping of a 12-year-old elementary school pupil. The state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> refused to put the measure to the voters. `` I can not for the life of me understand why a <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would be unwilling to let the people of a county vote on whether they wanted to raise the money to pay for the safety of kids,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Newburn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON>, security chief in <LOCATION> Mobile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said he is seeking a $ 150,000 increase in the $ 430,000 security budget to put unarmed guards in high schools. `` Our biggest concern in campus security is how to keep students from bringing guns to school,'' <PERSON> McFadden </PERSON> said. In 1988-89, 146 students were suspended for weapons possession, including 30 cases involving guns. <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>'s school security budget has doubled in five years to $ 1 million and will rise by $ 300,000 in 1989-90, said safety director <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mourning </PERSON>. New this year: security systems to protect cars from theft and vandalism, and closed circuit TV monitors in 15 elementary schools in high - crime areas Beyond guards and hardware, <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> are offering `` anger management classes'' to teach youngsters alternatives to violence. The course was tested last year in four <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> schools and will expand this year to four to six more.

 The <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, school district has spent $ 90,000 to install intercoms and a fence around an elementary school where an intruder last year shot and killed two third-graders and wounded seven other students and two teachers. Weapons, drug-related violence, thefts and gang problems have spread to small-town schools, leading authorities to try the same high-tech security hardware inner-city schools rely on, a 50-state <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey has found. `` We have to be conscious of security in small districts, a lot more than we used to be,'' said superintendent <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where a rash of break-ins forced the district to triple its security outlays in the last five years. The effort is mainly to protect new VCRs, computers, tape recorders and camera equipment. Another problem is siphoning of gasoline from school buses. In central <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> school district spends about $ 3,000 a year on motion detector equipment to protect computers at the middle and high schools. `` Compared to five years ago, we did n't have that kind of equipment. We did n't have that volume of computer equipment to protect,'' said superintendent <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>. The 1,900-student <ORGANIZATION> Perryton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> panhandle pays about $ 5,000 a year for drug-sniffing dogs and $ 250 for security lighting. So far, those measures have n't turned up much, spokesman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> acknowledged. `` We found a pill once that looked pretty suspicious, but it turned out to be a Contac capsule,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Yankton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, school authorities prefer a hard line on school crime to security hardware. A 15-year-old boy convicted of making a false bomb threat wound up serving time at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, and an 18-year-old was sentenced to one year in the <ORGANIZATION> Yankton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for a similar threat. Not every rural school is worried. Several years ago, in an incident that drew national attention, an armed gunman took an entire school of children hostage in <LOCATION> Cokeville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. But state superintendent <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> said the incident was an aberration and it did n't change his approach to security. `` We can rest easy in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. We just do n't have to worry about those problems,'' said <PERSON> Simons </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Eatonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, high school principal <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorn </PERSON> knows his kids sometimes bring weapons to school _ but he says it's only during hunting season.

 Grocery stores may offer rain checks or substitutes when they run out of advertised specials or may specify beforehand that availability is limited, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruled. A final rule, to be published Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> and take effect four days later, amends one adopted in 1971 that required grocers to stock enough advertised items to meet anticipated demand. That rule had rarely been enforced and the commission had voted in April 1988 to approve making the rule change, meaning the newest action is largely a formality. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> began reviewing its earlier rule in 1984 and determined that the cost of compliance outweighed the benefits. According to the review, the 1971 rule imposed an estimated $ 132 million to $ 370 million in costs on retail food stores, with those costs passed on to consumers.

 You're staying at a Radisson hotel and craving pizza. You spot a card on the nightstand advertising pizza delivery. A call brings a piping-hot pie to the door delivered by a person wearing what appears to be a pizza chain's outfit. It is n't. Though hotel guests might assume they are ordering pizza from an outlet outside the hotel, such as Domino's or Pizza Hut, they're not The pizza is baked in the same hotel kitchen that makes regular room-service orders and is delivered by a room service employee disguised as a pizza delivery person. Why the subterfuge? <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>, vice president of food services for <ORGANIZATION> Radisson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, said the hotels had to overcome the perception among travelers that a room-service pizza is n't as good as one from a pizza parlor. So the company decided to pattern its pizza delivery on Domino's. `` To be perfectly honest, we do n't tell the customer it's from room service,'' said <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>. `` If they ask, we would tell them. We are not dishonest about it. If they do n't ask, we do n't tell them.'' Radisson developed the in-house pizza idea in 1985 after company President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Norlander </PERSON> noticed the number of empty Domino's boxes lining the halls of a <ORGANIZATION> Radisson </ORGANIZATION> hotel during a company business conference. The Minneapolis-based hotel chain's in-house pizza delivery service used to be called `` Pizza ... We Deliver!'' The pizza was offered through room service, and sales were disappointing, <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON> said. Radisson's new pizza service is named `` Napolizza ... The Pizza With Pizzazz,'' after the Italian city of <LOCATION> Napoli </LOCATION>, which claims to be the birthplace of pizza. The Napolizza phone number is separate from room service's and is listed prominently among pizza delivery services in the room's telephone directory. Radisson room service employees who deliver pizza wear a nylon jacket, baseball cap and polo shirt emblazoned with the Napolizza logo. The pie is delivered in a pizza box or in a `` hot wrap,'' a thermal insulated carrying case. Like Domino's, the Napolizza pizza comes with discount coupons for future purchases. The pizza is delivered within 29 minutes or it's free _ one minute less than Domino's 30-minute delivery guarantee. Not everyone is fooled by the illusion, <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON> said. `` It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out that hotels do n't allow free-standing restaurants to advertise -LRB- in the rooms -RRB- very often,'' he said. About 45 of the 110 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radisson </ORGANIZATION> hotels offer the service, <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON> said. Sales average 40-45 pizzas daily per hotel, almost 2 -LCB- times the number sold under <ORGANIZATION> Radisson </ORGANIZATION>'s old program, and Domino's sales at the hotels have been cut significantly, he said A `` good many'' of the 1,400 Holiday Inns in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have an in-house pizza program, but there's no attempt to disguise the pizza's origin, said <PERSON> Ginny </PERSON> <PERSON> Troutt </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Memphis-based chain. `` We noticed a lot of pizza boxes in guest rooms,'' she said. `` We thought, why not offer a pizza?'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON>, a spokesman for Domino's <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said the company is n't concerned about being imitated. `` We wish them luck. Imitation's the best form of flattery,'' <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said, adding that Domino's has n't noticed an impact on sales at hotels that offer in-house pizzas.

 <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a struggling financial services company, says it has reached a tentative agreement to sell part of its holdings for $ 310 million to the family-owned <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> partnership. The price is about $ 20 million to $ 30 million below the low end of the range that <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> executives had predicted to creditors that the assets might fetch, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, Integrated's co-chief executive, said Thursday in an interview Nevertheless, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said he believed the announcement showed that Integrated Resources was taking credible steps toward raising money to make payments on its $ 1.75 billion in debt. Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to creditors since June, when it declared a moratorium because of deepening financial troubles. Integrated said last week it would try to sell its core financial service companies for $ 450 million to $ 525 million, but <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> was interested in only part of the holdings, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. Since the offer came in below projections, Integrated said it would continue to solicit bidders for them, but would pay <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> a $ 4 million breakup fee if their deal was dropped. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said other parties are interested in the parts of the business <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> did not want, <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> is half owned by members of the de Gunzburg branch of the <PERSON> Bronfman </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, heirs to the <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> distilling fortune, and half by the <PERSON> Moross </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which has extensive financial services interests. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> has holdings in life insurance and property and casualty brokerage. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> would buy <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clearing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The sale price would be $ 297 million, plus a portion of tax benefits received by the core companies after the sale that would raise the total purchase price to $ 310 million. <ORGANIZATION> Whitehall </ORGANIZATION> would not buy Integrated's <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, its tax-sheltered annuity business, its ordinary life insurance business or <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. After the spinoff of subsidiaries, Integrated's main business would be management of existing public and private limited partnerships and real estate investment trusts.

 Stock market analysts say the risk of a financial meltdown is far lower today than it was two years ago, the last time the Dow Jones industrial average was in record territory. A 56.53-point leap in the Dow Jones average Thursday carried it to 2,734.64, surpassing the record of 2,722.42 that was set precisely two years ago today. The 1987 peak was the start of a short but severe bear market that culminated in the worst day in Wall Street history, the 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials on Oct. 19, 1987. Evidence of that debacle was hard to find Thursday. `` The quote of the day is something like: What crash?'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> arm of a Japanese brokerage firm Supporting the stock market in 1989 are a healthy dollar, relatively low interest rates and optimism that the economy will manage to steer a middle course between recession and high inflation. Most of all, there is no speculative bubble ready to be popped. Stock prices are far lower in relation to underlying company profits than they were two years ago, said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Kudlow </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Fundamentally this is a great expression of confidence in the whole <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic outlook,'' <PERSON> Kudlow </PERSON> said. `` We keep throwing negatives at the market and they do n't stick.'' Added <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, chief economist at the brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, `` Essentially the stock market is telling us that a soft landing is in store for the economy, and that's exactly the slowdown you need to keep inflation from accelerating,'' While some other strategists are more skeptical about the economy's health, a market rally can sometimes feed on itself regardless of fundamental factors `` The worst thing that can happen to an institutional money manager is to sit there with a pile of cash and watch the market take off with out him. It's a buying panic,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON>, managing director for retail sales at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Rodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Renshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday's gain was the second-biggest of the year, and it came in the heaviest trading since mid-June, a good sign for the market Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> totaled 225.52 million shares. There was no economic news Thursday to account for the big jump. Bonds were up slightly and the dollar edged higher. `` The market's going up just on its own. When you call around, there's no reason. It just went up,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. From its low point at the close of Black Monday to its close Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average, which represents the stock of 30 major companies, rose 57 percent. `` While nobody's paid much attention to it, it's two of the strongest years, back to back, that we've had,'' <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON> said.

 Fixed-rate mortgage rates rose to a national average of 9.85 percent this month after dropping in July to their lowest level in more than two years, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fannie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mae </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the new average for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages rose from 9.73 last month, the lowest level since fixed-rate morgages averaged 9.25 percent in March 1987. The rates for one-year adjustable mortgages, meanwhile, fell to 8.51 percent from 8.66 percent in July. Because of generally declining rates, homebuyers have flocked to fixed-rate mortgages recently.

 Two years ago today, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed at an all-time high. Two months later, the market crashed. The resurgent Dow Jones industrials average on Thursday finally cracked its 1987 record but few if any market professionals believe that history will repeat itself. `` You did n't have the euphoric buying all summer long'' this year, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatchford </PERSON>, a 27-year-old market maker on the options floor. `` It's based on sound economic news. The economy is stronger than people thought.'' In stark contrast with the go-go days of Summer 1987, this year's rise to new record highs has been slow and steady `` Everyone knows what the monster looks like and they're looking over their shoulders to see him,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seijas </PERSON>, a partner in a stock exchange member firm. Traders spilled out of the exchange at Wall and New streets after the closing bell Thursday as on any other day. But this time the Dow Jones industrials average had finished at a record 2,734.64, surpassing its reading of 2,722.42 on Aug. 25, 1987. The rise in the closely watched measure 30 key industrial company stocks is considered the final symbolic sign on Wall Street of the steady recovery since the 1987 crash, which saw the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> plunge 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987. Other key indexes shattered record highs earlier this summer. The Dow flirted with the record several times earlier this month, breaking through the top number but ending the day lower. A subdued cheer rose from the exchange floor after the close Thursday. `` A day like every other day _ no big deal,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, a specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was no question in everybody's mind that the market would get back to these levels. It just needed some time.'' Market players said the difference between 1987 and 1989 lies in the economy's strength, with inflation apparently under control and interest rates gradually heading lower _ the non-recessionary `` soft landing'' many economists have been predicting. They did say cracking the old record was significant because, on Wall Street, psychological barriers are important. Thanks to the economy's strength, optimism remains the vanguard on the Street. `` The market seems to want to go higher,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a specialist with <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. `` The further away you get from the crash, the better it is.''

 The proposed $ 2.2 billion sale of <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would make <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> the world's largest hotel manager and clear the way for parent <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to concentrate on its casinos and newer hotel chains, market observers say. <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` is poised for substantial growth in their new form and with a much better balance sheet,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, a market analyst with the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Holiday, the Memphis-based parent of Holiday Inns, announced the proposed sale Thursday, prompting the company's stock to jump $ 6 a share to close at $ 83 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> `` The price received for the Holiday Inn brand was a very solid valuation of about 13 -LCB- times pre-tax cashflow. That looks pretty attractive considering it's a tax-free transaction to <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, a market analyst with the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Keegan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. The sale must be approved by shareholders of both companies. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said no dates have been set for shareholder meetings to vote on the proposal. <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it would form a new subsidiary to run its profitable hotel-casino company, <ORGANIZATION> Harrah </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, and its newer hotel chains, Embassy Suites, <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> and Homewood Suites. `` It clearly focuses the company in the high-growth segments of the hotel business,'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said. Holiday said its newer hotel brands have grown to the point that they compete with Holiday Inn in the marketplace and for attention within the corporation. Under the proposed sale agreement, Holiday stockholders would get one-quarter share of Bass stock for each of their Holiday shares, worth a total of about $ 125 million. They also would get a $ 35-a-share dividend from the new Holiday subsidiary. In addition, they would get one share in the new subsidiary for each of their Holiday shares, and <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said that stock would be worth $ 45 to $ 55 a share. The sale will allow <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to shed $ 2.1 billion in debt, which will be assumed by Bass. Much of the debt stems from the company's recapitalization in 1987, which allowed the company to pay shareholders an extra dividend to ward of a takeover threat by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` As a result of that, the new company when it's spun off will be virtually debt-free. It will then borrow or finance new borrowing to pay the dividend,'' he said. With the sale, <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> will acquire 55 owned or leased Holiday Inns as well as franchise agreements, joint venture agreements and management contracts covering about 1,400 other Holiday Inns in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Last year, <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> bought the rights to franchise Holiday Inn hotels outside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the company is a major franchisee in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Bass already owns 14 Holiday Inns in the southeast <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Bass has more than 7,300 pubs and other food and drink outlets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>. The company also brews Bass, <ORGANIZATION> Carling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Label </ORGANIZATION> and other beers. It has annual sales approaching $ 6 billion. The British company is expected to keep <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said, and <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees now working for <ORGANIZATION> Holiday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> will become Bass employees.

<HEAD>Fines Against Trader, Firm Sign Of Increased Policing, Experts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Fines totaling $ 550,000 against a top commodities trader and his firm are a sign of increased internal policing in the face of a federal investigation of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s futures markets, industry experts say. The Commodity Exchange on Thursday fined and suspended the trader, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Semel </PERSON>, for violating trading rules. <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> is one of the targets of the government's criminal and civil probes of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s commodity markets. `` It's a very large fine and it's probably making a statement that what he did was bad and trying to tell the rest of Comex to be careful,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, a commodities lawyer and former chairman of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The fines against <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Semel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a brokerage in gold, silver and other commodities, were believed to be the largest in exchange history, officials said. <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> was cited for internal trading rules violations that also are being examined in civil and criminal probes at <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> and three other exchanges announced in May by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The probes are unrelated to a longstanding probe of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s commodity markets that recently yielded 46 indictments for racketeering and fraud A government official familiar with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investigations confirmed Thursday that <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> is `` one of many'' traders whose actions are being examined. The official, who asked not to be named, said the probes include the same types of violations cited by <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION>. More than 50 traders received subpoenas and federal authorities are examining boxes of documents provided by the exchanges and traders, defense lawyers said Thursday. No action in the federal probe is expected for at least two months, lawyers said. The official familiar with the criminal probe said investigators from the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service are examining documents subpoenaed by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've still got a while to go on the criminal case,'' the official said. <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> was fined $ 350,000 and suspended for nine months from the exchange while <ORGANIZATION> Semel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was fined $ 200,000. The violations by <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> involve improper cross-trading and prohibited dual trading, two offenses that center on trading for customers and personal accounts. <PERSON> Semel </PERSON>, 39, and his firm also were cited under exchange rules for misconduct, disreputable or fraudulent conduct and conduct detrimental to the exchange. Comex guidelines regarding the two stated trading violations bar traders from taking the opposite side of an order received and from trading for personal accounts while holding a customer's order for the same commodity. Officials said the charges listed generally involve a practice know as `` front-running'' _ getting an unfair advantage by trading for personal accounts ahead of customer orders for the same commodity. That pracice is under scrutiny in the federal probes. A person answering the telephone Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Semel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said no one would be available for comment. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> probe reportedly examines violations including pre-arranged trading, using advance knowledge of customer trades to trade for personal accounts and conducting trades in order to skirt tax obligations. The criminal probe reportedly includes examination of alleged front-running at the exchanges and whether brokers and traders illegally shared information with each other about customer orders. Comex issued a complaint against <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> _ a powerful figure on the exchange floor _ in June 1988 for trading that took place before then, <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> said. He refused to release other details about the internal probe. <PERSON> Semel </PERSON> was expected to appeal the penalty to the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> but spokeswoman <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> said he had not yet done so. In addition to the Comex, the government in May issued subpoenas to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 Young, healthy and hungry for a new start in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, thousands of newly arrived East German refugees are snapping up blue-collar jobs spurned by West Germans. `` They wo n't have any trouble integrating themselves here,'' said <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Sund </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhine-Westphalia </ORGANIZATION> labor office, as he surveyed hundreds of escapees filling out applications or scanning job notices at the refugee reception center here. `` They are young, eager and in many cases well-trained,'' <PERSON> Sund </PERSON> said. `` They were the future of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' More than 65,000 East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this year, emigrating legally in record numbers and escaping through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s recently relaxed borders at a rate unequaled since 1961, when the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall staunched the last rush to the West. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s main reception center in <LOCATION> Giessen </LOCATION> became so crowded last week that officials opened a new post outside this village near <LOCATION> Muenster </LOCATION> to handle the overflow. The Schoeppingen center opened less than a week ago, but word of the willing workforce has spread fast. Hand-lettered signs offering manual-labor jobs are posted by the dozens on the chain-link fences surrounding the barracks that on Thursday housed 900 East Germans, nearly all of whom had escaped illegally through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The more aggressive employers cruise by the camp in luxury cars to offer a ride as well as a workplace. One woman in a Mercedes with <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> license plates said she was searching for a live-in maid. In Building No. 7 of the crowded but orderly encampment is a makeshift branch of the state employment office. Neat rows of job notices offer immediate work for plumbers, cooks, roofers, painters and other tradesmen. `` It makes no difference to me where I go to work,'' said <PERSON> Burkhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, a printer from <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> bused here two days ago after a harrowing escape with his family that twice landed him in Hungarian jails. `` I just want to get a place to live and get my family settled.'' <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Handschuch </PERSON> of the regional employment office in nearby <LOCATION> Coesfeld </LOCATION> said nearly 200 jobs had been called in to the camp during each of the past few days. The eager offerings from employers who have long sought manual laborers, as well as the urgency felt by escapees who want to get started in new jobs, has resulted in a chaotic match-making system. <PERSON> Handschuch </PERSON> said the handful of government labor advisers at the camp can do little to verify either the prospective employee's qualifications or the employer's working conditions `` There are some people who come here with expectations of the <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where everyone immediately has a job, a car and a beautiful home,'' <PERSON> Handschuch </PERSON> said. `` But I would say most are realistic about their chances.'' <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, a 44-year-old <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION> resident who ran a restaurant until she applied to emigrate four years ago, said she was confident she and her husband would be settled soon. `` There are so many jobs for food service people here. We had n't expected such a wealth of choice,'' she said East Germans are more easily assimilated in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> than their <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc neighbors because of the common language and relative familiarity with Western lifestyles. West German TV can be seen in most parts of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The transition is tougher for ethnic Germans emigrating from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisel </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> state, said his office placed a Soviet chef who could n't adjust to the restaurant's supplies. Language problems aside, he had seldom worked with more than salt and pepper for seasonings. Many East German immigrants have insufficient education or experience to go directly into their fields, especially in computer-related work, said <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mausch </PERSON>, spokesman for the federal <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. `` But in the long term, with some additional training, the outlook is very good,'' he said. `` These people want to stay here and build careers.'' <PERSON> Mausch </PERSON> said there were more than 255,000 jobs open in blue-collar fields that employers had called in to state employment offices. `` Obviously there are a great many others that we do n't even know about,'' he said. Signs offering waitress or janitorial work can be seen in the windows of shops in virtually every West German city, as even young West Germans resist jobs that are menial or low-paying. The nation's 2 million jobless _ more than 8 percent _ are mostly skilled workers in depressed fields such as steel-making, shipbuilding and coal mining, and the generous social welfare system discourages them from switching to other trades. <PERSON> Mausch </PERSON> said East Germans with experience in electrical work, engineering and personal services such as hairdressing were in high demand in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Workers in all fields are in severe shortage in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which has encouraged the communist leadership to retain tight restrictions on Western travel and emigration despite widespread public pressure for reform. Many of the Schoeppingen refugees, who stay here an average of three or four days before setting out for resettlement, said they left illegally because they knew they would never be allowed to emigrate. `` We are exactly the kind of people the state does n't want to leave,'' observed one woman, who did not want her name used. Smiling sardonically, she nodded toward the crush of young families and added: `` This must really be killing the authorities at home.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION>. Co is phasing out operations at its oldest manufacturing plant _ a sign that the food industry giant is moving ahead with aggressive plans to garner a larger share of the $ 2 billion soup market. A decade ago, corporate brass at the nation's largest soup maker balked at the thought of laying off workers at antiquated plants operating at less than capacity. It took 18 months to close an obsolete facility in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> because company Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the son of the inventor of condensed soup, hated to lay workers off. `` Ten years ago they acted very paternalistically,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, an analyst at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Acting on results from a 3-year study of <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s operations, the company announced Thursday a worldwide restructuring that will include the loss of 2,800 jobs and the closure of the 120-year-old manufacturing plant at its headquarters here and plants in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> The reorganization, approved at a board of directors' meeting Thursday, is expected to save the company almost $ 15 million during its fiscal 1990 and about $ 150 million over the next four years, said <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Cade </PERSON>. The restructuring is expected to produce a one-time charge of about $ 344 million, or $ 2.01 a share, against earnings for the 1989 fiscal year, the company said. Production at the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> plant would be moved to other canned food plants in <LOCATION> Napoleon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Maxton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the company said. The plant manufactures <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION>'s soups, Franco-American pasta, beans and Prego spaghetti sauce. The plant, which opened in the company's first year of existence in 1869, will be closed by July 1990, eliminating 940 jobs. The plant, though large, is inefficient because of its eight-story layout. Also slated for closure are a 272-employee plant in <LOCATION> Pocomoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, a 246-worker plant in <LOCATION> Crisfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and an 84-employee plant in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Five more plants with a total of 1,200 workers will be closed at a later, unspecified date, company officials said `` We feel that this will make <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> more efficient,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cade </PERSON> said. `` Their time has passed them by and they just are n't efficient as they should be.'' Many of the employees will be offered transfers and others will be offered severance pay or aid in finding other jobs, <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. The company said it plans to maintain its headquarters in this poor city across the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Plans are underway to begin construction later this year on a $ 35 million, 200,000-square-foot international headquarters on the city's waterfront Company officials said the 1,700 headquarters employees will not be affected by the plant closing. Restructuring also is expected at some of the company's foreign plants, Ms. <PERSON> Cade </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> has about 100 processing plants scattered around the world, including about 60 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The board already approved capital expenditures of $ 430 million for fiscal 1990 to upgrade plants, <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's really a statement that management is making that we're going to be lean and mean,'' said <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> `` Any food company who wants to be independent in the ` 90s had better be a very low-cost producer with a global presence.'' The restructuring comes as little surprise, <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said. `` Two years ago the company told the world they planned to be -LRB- on -RRB- top,'' <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said. `` This is just moving that program into super-high gear.'' Since 1986, the company has phased out plants in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pottstown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Doylestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, under the program, Ms. <PERSON> Cade </PERSON> said. Before his death in April, <PERSON> Dorrance </PERSON> began to recognize that the industry was moving toward consolidated, state-of-the-art operations, <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year, garnering about 65 percent of the $ 2.2 billion retail soup market, a drop of about 5 percent in the past five years. The company also has had difficulty breaking into the faster-growing dry-soup market.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar firmed slightly in quiet European trading today but traders said the market lacked a fundamental direction. Gold prices were lower. Foreign exchange dealers said the market was quiet because most players were unwilling to take new positions before the weekend and there was a lack of economic news. The next important <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic figures are revised second-quarter gross national product figures due out Tuesday. `` It is really impossible to detect a trend,'' said a trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. `` The market is very quiet and lackluster.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5670 to buy one pound, cheaper for buyers than $ 1.5698 dollars late Thursday. Other mid-morning dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.9620 West German marks, up from 1.9585; 1.6920 Swiss francs, up from 1.6880; 6.6145 French francs, up from 6.6060; 2.2127 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2095; 1,408.50 Italian lire, up from 1,406.75; 1.1745 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1765. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.07 yen to a closing 143.53 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 143.72 yen. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 362.40 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 362.75. At mid-morning, the city's bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 361.15 In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold traded at a bid $ 360.85 compared with $ 362.00 late Thursday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold fell $ 2.64 to close at a bid $ 362.11. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a bid price of $ 5.14 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $ 5.17.

 The dollar edged down against the yen today, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> closed lower. The dollar closed at 143.53 yen, down 0.07 yen from Thursday's close of 143.60 The dollar started the day at 143.38 yen, and moved in a range of 143.33-143 .63 yen On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, a 106.73-point loser Thursday, lost 46.62 points today to close marginally lower at 34,739.93. Currency dealers said trading was light and directionless. `` Japanese customers were staying on the sidelines,'' said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The resignation of Chief Cabinet Secretary <PERSON> Tokuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> today did not have a major impact on currency markets, <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> announced he would resign after apologizing for an extramarital affair with a bar hostess. `` Usually it would have an impact on the market, but the market did n't move because many Japanese institutions had long dollar positions and could n't buy on the upside of the dollar,'' <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said. On the stock market, prices were dampened by concerns about interest rates, said a dealer at brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity. Because domestic consumption and economic growth look like they may be stronger this quarter than earlier expected, `` the market is having to sit up and take notice of what's happening with interest rates,'' he said. The effect of <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON>'s resignation was `` minimal,'' the dealer said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, in what may indicate a new get-tough policy, is contemplating action against three radio stations it says may have aired indecent broadcasts during the day. The stations in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were given 30 days to explain their actions or face sanctions ranging from a warning to non-renewal of their licenses, FCC General Counsel <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said Thursday. The action comes just two weeks after former <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> broadcaster <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> was confirmed as <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> chairman. <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON> and two other new commissioners were questioned closely during <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearings last month on what they planned to do about indecent programming. Obscene programming is banned. The agency alleges that WLUP-AM in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, KSJO-FM in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and WFBQ-FM in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> may have violated laws prohibiting indecent or obscene programming when children may be in the audience. Lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, president of Decency in <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the Indianapolis-based watchdog group had taped <ORGANIZATION> WFBQ </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Bob and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> Show'' continuously since July 1987 and submitted more than 5,000 transcripts to the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> for review. `` In the last six months particularly, there's been a real decline in the quality of material,'' he said Thursday. `` It was bad before, but it's really bad now.'' Price said he hoped the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> action would be `` the first step in a process that will improve broadcasting in our area.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, an outspoken advocate of banning indecent programming 24 hours a day, applauded the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> action. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are fed up with this trash that corrupts the minds of our children and erodes the values of our society,'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, executive director of the Washington-based free-speech advocacy group <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, criticized the FCC. `` I'm disappointed that Chairman <PERSON> Sikes </PERSON>' top priority seems to be suppressing speech rather than promoting it,'' <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said that based on `` review of complaints and extensive supporting materials received from the public,'' it was considering actions against: _ <ORGANIZATION> Evergreen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> AM, licensee of WLUP-AM, regarding portions of the `` <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>,'' which airs at 2:30 p.m. _ <ORGANIZATION> Narragansett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, licensee of <LOCATION> KSJO-FM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, regarding portions of the `` Perry Stone Show,'' which aired at 6 a.m. _ <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, licensee of WFBQ-FM, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, regarding portions of the `` Bob and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> Show,'' which airs at 6 a.m. On <ORGANIZATION> WLUP </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Steve and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> Show'' on March 30, 1989, and Aug. 19, 1987, there were alleged discussions of erections; descriptions of magazine pictures of former Miss America <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and another woman; and a song about a man filming `` Kiddie Porn'' at a Stone programs on Oct. 25, 27, 28 and 31, and Nov. 4, 1988, allegedly included a segment in which <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told a female caller he wanted to lick food off her body; a later segment that featured a ribald version of the theme from the `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hillbillies </LOCATION>'' TV show; a segment on incest and one on classical music performed in `` fellatio.'' On WFBQ, there allegedly was talk Oct. 16, 1987, and Sept. 14, 1987, of sex with candy bars, and a skit of Elvis discussing sex and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. The latest these broadcasts occurred was at 5:10 p.m., <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, general manager of WFBQ-FM, told the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> that the station was `` fairly confident'' the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> will find that its rules were followed. `` The material does n't have the innuendo attached to it that one might read into the complaint,'' <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON> said about the `` Bob and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> Show'' complaints. `` Once the material is put into context, I'm sure we will be cleared of doing anything wrong.'' There was no answer to telephone calls to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> stations Thursday evening. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, based on <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings in the `` seven dirty words'' case involving comedian <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>, defines indecency as `` language or material that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or organs. Such material may not be broadcast when there is a reasonable risk that unsupervised children may be in the audience.'' The commission has tried to establish a `` safe harbor'' for indecent programming from midnight to 6 a.m., when children were considered unlikely to be listening, but a court struck down that rule last summer. The court said the commission could ban indecent speech only during daytime hours. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> in June 1988 fined a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, station, KZKC-TV, $ 2,000 for broadcasting the movie `` Private Lessons'' at 8 p.m. The movie features explicit nudity in a story about a housekeeper seducing a 15-year-old boy. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year passed a law extending the ban on indecent broadcast material to 24 hours, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stayed implementation of the law in January pending an appeal by broadcasters and First Amendment advocates. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday also asked the court not to rule on the 24-hour ban challenge before the commission can study the issue further, <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> said.

 A castle door, a silver saddle, seven crystal chandeliers, a bronze Indian statue and other collectibles could help bail out a few failed <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrifts. The items, including 17th Century antiques, a Bacarach crystal eagle, sculptures and artwork, belonged to 16 insolvent savings and loans and will be auctioned by federal regulators Saturday to help pay the thrifts' bills. Among those is <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION>, whose former president is on trial for allegedly using thrift funds to buy influence. In all, about 20,000 pieces are expected to bring in about $ 625,000 for regulators to use in bailing out the industry. A similar auction in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> last month netted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> $ 795,000. Two more sales are scheduled, `` and then we'll be out of the furniture business,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pace </PERSON>, who oversees receiverships in the central regulatory division. While the bulk of the items are office furnishings and banking equipment, attention has been focused on antiques and unusual pieces, many acquired by Vernon officials on European shopping sprees. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, closed by regulators in a $ 1.3 billion bailout in September 1987, is frequently cited as an example of the worst abuses in the industry, and some of its top executives have pleaded guilty to or face fraud charges. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, former president of Vernon, is on trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on charges he approved using deposits to pay for junkets for state regulators and thrift officials. The trial, which began Aug. 7, recessed this week because of the death of the father of one of the prosecutors. It is scheduled to resume Monday. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> owner <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> is the target of federal criminal investigators and already has been named in a $ 540 million federal civil fraud lawsuit. Some of the antiques for sale during the four-day auction were in <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s and other Vernon offices, Pace said. Among the items for sale are: _ Seven 17th Century carved oak chairs _ A hand-carved castle door with brass bosses and strap work _ A 47-inch-tall, bronze Indian sitting on a 40-inch-by-40-inch base _ Numerous smaller sculptures and statues, including several by <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Remington </PERSON> _ A replica of a bald eagle, made from the feathers of non-endangered birds _ Two rams horns and brass wall sconces _ A longhorn skull _ A hand-tooled, custom-made saddle with silver mounted candle, horn, skirt and stirrups and a silver bridle

 Stock prices churned ahead today, extending the yearlong rally that carried the market to record highs on Thursday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.88 to 2,740.52 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 600 up, 333 down and 525 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 34.83 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. The market appeared to pause briefly at the opening as some traders cashed in the dramatic gains of stock prices lately. But prices soon began edging ahead again on the strength of the enthusiasm generated Thursday's record high and the widespread public attention it received. Analysts say the market has been able to recoup the last of the losses it suffered in the crash of 1987 with help from increasing confidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> can restrain inflation without causing a recession. They also note that corporate earnings have risen sharply in the past two years, making the perceived risk in stocks less than it was when the market peaked out two years ago today. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, up 2 -RCB- at 133 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 58 |; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 116 \, and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .20 to 195.49.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> promised he was through. He was going to sell his last load of ocean sponge and leave this <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> fishing town, where he was lured 18 months ago by record-high sponge prices. Maybe he'd take his wife and child to the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> and try to make some money salvaging old wrecks. `` This is it,'' he said, standing amid 700 sponges drying on the deck of a weathered fishing boat. `` I'm getting out while I at least have my diving equipment. But I can say it was real good there for a while.'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> became the latest defection from the <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> sponge fleet as prices have fallen about 80 percent since February, when a large sponge could bring in $ 16 and even inexperienced divers could easily make $ 1,000 a week. Now, it's mostly just the few veteran spongers left to wonder about the brief boom that clogged the docks with boats and left at least four young divers dead from accidental drownings. Some of the old-time sponge merchants _ mostly <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> immigrants and their descendants _ claim the prices were inflated by Japanese investors who recently entered the shaky Mediterranean sponge market. Others, like sponge buyer <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Arellano </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, say a 3-year-old blight affecting <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> sponge beds was responsible for a worldwide shortage. `` It was simple supply and demand,'' said the executive of <ORGANIZATION> Arellano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the main buyer of <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> sponges as prices soared. `` There are no good sponges coming out of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> and the value of the <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> sponges went up. It's not more complicated than that.'' <PERSON> Arellano </PERSON> said prices have dropped to $ 3 or $ 4 each due to the flood of sponges on the world market from <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. Although sponges grow in many warm-water areas, the best species come either from the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> or the Gulf waters off <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, where the nutrients and rock beds are ideal for large and hardy sponges, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevely </PERSON>, a sponge expert affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> blight, suspected to be caused by a bacteria, makes the sponges small and brittle. A similar disease in the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> in the 1940s nearly wiped out the sponge industry in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, which is now a sponge supplier to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> nations. A sponge is acually the remains of a marine animal that lives in the pores. Sun drying kills the living part of the natural sponge, now mostly sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Staates </LOCATION> as a novelty bath item or as a non-scratching alternative to synethetic sponges. But the demand for natural sponge is still high in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and elsewhere. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Billiris </PERSON>, who began sponge diving in 1939, believes Japanese sponge interests purchased the high-priced sponges earlier this year in an attempt to corner the market and drive out smaller competitors. `` Look, if a sponge cost $ 15 each it would cost the consumer $ 45 for a sponge. That did n't happen. I think they were just trying to protect their investments in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Billiris </PERSON>. But <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantonis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Acme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sponge </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chamois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, said it was mostly a panic among European buyers as inventories of pre-blight Mediterranean sponges fell. He also noted that European sponge buyers, who usually make purchases by the kilogram, were unfamiliar with the denser <LOCATION> Tarpons </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> wool sponges. `` Acually, the per-kilo price was not that crazy,'' said <PERSON> Cantonis </PERSON>, also president of the New York-based Sponge and <ORGANIZATION> Chamois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` But they were surprised by the wool sponges. You got only about half as many per kilo. `` At one point, our sponges were selling at $ 3.50 an ounce. Silver now sells about $ 5 an ounce. This is not gold or silver we are taking about.'' <PERSON> Cantonis </PERSON> said there are no records of natural sponge sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or worldwide. Although experts are not sure how long the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> blight may last, Acme has built a new sponge processing plant to meet European demand. `` This portends well for <LOCATION> Tarpon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` What the prices will do, I can not say.'' When the boom began, sponge diver <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Barger </PERSON> said he predicted prices would fall. He also was correct about his other preminition _ that untrained divers would die. In February, more than 200 people were diving for sponges. Now, there's less than two dozen. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> investigated the deaths of at least four divers. Some of the victims were working alone and had problems with the air compressors or tangled air hoses. Divers can spend up to nine hours under 30 to 40 feet of water. `` This is serious business and people just thought you jump down there and pick up sponges like you pick up money,'' said <PERSON> Barger </PERSON>, who started diving two years ago. `` It was insane.'' `` Everyone is looking for the next oil boom,'' said <PERSON> Cantonis </PERSON>. `` Everyone is looking to become a millionaire overnight. Well, I can tell you, this is not the business they should be looking at.''

 When engineering graduate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> looked around in the mid-1980s and wondered how to make a living, he found the answer buried in the walls. Along with colleague <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> founded one of the first consulting firms that advise the best way to test for and dispose of asbestos, the widely used building insulation that has been found to cause cancer. Then <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> had a hunch about schools. By the time <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved a 1986 law requiring control and cleanup of asbestos in school buildings, <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> already had a national marketing campaign ready. <PERSON> Hall-Kimbrell </PERSON>'s growth exploded, its revenues tripling over the past three years from contracts with 15 percent of the nation's school districts `` I do n't know if it's a sixth sense or what, but we kind of feel things coming,'' said <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON>, 38. `` We try to watch for the regulatory trends _ what's the research on what is toxic, what are the liability issues _ and we felt that asbestos was going to be a major problem.'' Now <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> is betting on his sixth sense again. `` We started watching <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> two or three years ago,'' he said. `` And we speculated that they were just at that stage of industrialization where they're starting to address the issues of asbestos and employee occupational exposure. So far, we've been right.'' <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> bought out <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>'s interest in the firm after the first few months of business, although he's retained the Hall-Kimbrell corporate name. His hunches have propelled <PERSON> Hall-Kimbrell </PERSON>'s growth since he and his wife drew up a five-year plan in 1983 for the company they'd started in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> the year before They'd already made $ 120,000 from asbestos consulting and were trying to decide what to do. `` We wanted to be the best environmental engineering firm in the nation,'' he said. `` We decided to take the specialty we knew, asbestos, and form a national company on that. So we drew up a plan to take literally every penny we made and put it back into growth.'' The plague of lingering asbestos resurfaced this past week, when federal prosecutors filed civil suits against several defendants nationwide alleging improper handling of the material during renovation and removal projects. The lawsuits underscored the importance of the kind of services that Hall-Kimbrell and other asbestos-cleansing consultants provide. Hall-Kimbrell has surveyed more than 1,300 school districts for asbestos, in addition to 15 state governments, 200 colleges, ten airports and thousands of commercial clients. Typically, its engineers develop a plan to remove or contain asbestos, then monitor another company that actually does the work. Its revenues grew from $ 248,000 in 1983 to $ 45 million last year and a 34th place on <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> magazine's list of the fastest-growing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. The firm now employs about 800 people in 26 offices. <PERSON> Hall-Kimbrell </PERSON> moved to <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, to be in the central part of the country and near a regional <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> office, but much of its work remains on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. According to plan, <PERSON> Hall-Kimbrell </PERSON> also began diversifying in the late 1980s, advising companies on environmental problems ranging from hazardous wastes and groundwater contamination. Next year, it expects to start a hotline in connection with grocery store chains, to let customers know how much pesticide is in the produce they buy. The fast growth has n't been problem free. The company laid off 39 workers earlier this summer in a move to cut costs. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> had considered a $ 72.5 million buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> environmental firm. But <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> said he rejected the deal because of differences with Law Companies over control. Nonetheless, many analysts think such deals are the industry's future Fast-growing, small to medium-sized companies such as Hall-Kimbrell have dominated the asbestos-control business up to now, but bigger environmental services companies are want a piece of the market now estimated between $ 1 billion and $ 3 billion a year, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON>, a securities analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. Analysts foresee most of the industry's growth in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as more states approve even stricter asbestos guidelines for private buildings. But that has n't stopped Hall-Kimbrell from pressing ahead with its overseas plans. Most of its business overseas currently involves advising Japanese firms that own <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> property, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> governor who sits on <PERSON> Hall-Kimbrell </PERSON>'s board of directors and has helped it get started in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Given the context of how long it takes to set up business there, they're doing extremely well,'' <PERSON> Carlin </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices edged upward today, extending the yearlong rally that carried the market to record highs on Thursday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 56.53 points Thursday to surpass the peak it reached two years ago, rose 5.12 to 2,739.76 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 655 up, 558 down and 557 unchanged.

The market appeared to pause briefly at the opening as some traders cashed in the dramatic gains of stock prices lately.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it is considering selling a minority or controlling stake in its <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and has talked to parties interested in the airline. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest airline company, also said Thursday it has hired an investment adviser to explore a possible transaction. The announcement came a week after a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> investment firm disclosed that it holds 12 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which also owns strike-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Loomis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sayles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> portfolio management company, has said its 12 percent stake was held for investment because it believed <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> would show a profit in 1990. Scandinavian Airlines System owns around 10 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>. Late Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> released a statement saying its chairman, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, revealed that the company was considering a possible sale of an interest in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> during a management conference. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said in a statement there were arguments in favor of selling <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, such as giving the airline access to stronger financial resources. However, he said, `` there are also a number of compelling reasons why a sale of the company may not be advisable.'' Continental is emerging from a period of consolidations with other airlines as a stronger company and shows potential for improved financial results, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said it retained the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as an adviser on any transaction. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> declined to comment further on the statement. Miami-based Eastern is in the midst of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. The carrier filed for protection from its creditors on March 9, five days after its machinists, pilots and flight attendants went on strike. Since then, it has been rebuilding as a smaller airline using non-union workers. In 1983, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> followed a similar path with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. Airline industry analysts expressed surprise at <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s announcement `` I expected <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> would be the last thing he would dispose of,'' said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> would carry a sale price of about $ 2 billion if it were sold in its entirety, and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> may just be trying to find out what <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is worth, he suggested. `` He might just be testing the waters,'' <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON> said. Many observers had expected <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to fold the remnants of Eastern into <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, he noted. `` The worst may be over and it surprises me he would be considering a major sale,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He speculated that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> might be considering bringing in a high-profile purchaser to change <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s image as a low-fare carrier that does not appeal to business travelers. `` I think the biggest problem is the image of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> with the business travelers,'' <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened lower in light trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Prices were being pressured today by forecasts of rain in much of the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. But there was concern the severe weather forecast for parts of the Plains could have an adverse impact on some crop areas, said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Another drag on prices was the lack of action in the cash markets. Analysts said few farmers are bringing their product to market. With the exception of wheat, there was little export demand for grain and beans, <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON> said. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower in all contracts with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.93 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower with September at $ 2.33 \ a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent lower to -LCB- cent higher with September at $ 1.37 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 2 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 5.94 -LCB- cents a bushel Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mixed in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .07 cent lower to .03 cent higher with October at 75.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .38 cent lower with August at 83.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .35 cent lower with October at 41.32 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .10 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February at 41.52 cents a pound. Livestock futures settled lower and pork futures were mixed in Thursday's trading.

 Pilots from major competitors are volunteering to stage a wildcat work stoppage Sept. 4 to support <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strikers, a union official said Thursday. `` It's called Shut Down <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Eastern local of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's one of those things. We've never had anything from the grassroots like this before. All we can do is watch and see what happens.'' <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said the union was n't organizing the effort and had no details, but has been flooded with messages of support. He showed messages from pilots for such airlines as <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. One message called for `` S.O.S. _ Suspension of Service; Sick-Out in September ... Are you sick of what's happening to our Eastern brothers?'' <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s executive council, representing pilots at most of the nation's major airlines, last week took no action on a request by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots for a national work stoppage to show solidarity with the strike that will be six months old on Sept. 4. However, <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said that while unions can be fined or face other sanctions for encouraging wildcat strikes, an unofficial sickout may be forming as an alternative. Sept. 4 is Labor Day, a heavy travel day. <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> said members of other unions, including some outside the airline industry, also have offered to participate. Eastern's union leadership met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday to plan strategy. While some leaders two weeks ago discussed ending the strike, their rank-and-file members have voted in local meetings to continue. The pilots, who joined <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Machinists and flight attendants in a March 4 walkout, said they want action to dramatize that their strike is continuing and that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is rebuilding with inexperienced, newly hired pilots who are jeopardizing safety. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the company would n't comment on the reported work stoppage effort. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose reputed union-busting has been the focus of the strike, announced late Thursday that he is considering selling a minority or controlling stake in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the local chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union said Thursday he will resign in a disagreement over continuing the strike. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Holder, the head of the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> local of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots union, said the 300 pilots who attended a Wednesday meeting voted to continue the strike He said he objected to the decision because by continuing to strike, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> `` could hire enough replacement pilots and we could be gone.''

<HEAD>Cheering The Market On</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the first 4-minute mile was run it generated enthusiastic forecasts of a 3-minute, 50-second mile to come. When a high-jumper achieved 8 feet, sports enthusiasts said man could go higher. Same thing in stocks: Records create excitement and enthusiasm for more. When the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average reached a new high last week you could hear the roar of the boosters seeking even greater heights. It might work. It might not. Excitement and enthusiasm have been ingredients of stock markets for all time, and to some unmeasured degree they have an impact. But when the cheering stops, it's the pace of the economy and profits that dictate prices. The consensus forecast is for the economy to grow slowly, just skirting recession. The corporate profits outlook is for a loss of momentum, a decline in the rate of growth. It is happening already. Conceivably, the stock market could `` see'' something the economists do n't. It would n't be the first time it has foreseen better or worse times than the consensus forecast. It could happen again. Whatever, the scaffolding for stock prices is stronger now than it was before the October 1987 crash, when enthusiasm alone seemed to carry the market for several hundred points. Whether or not it is sufficiently strong is debatable. <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which relies on numerical rather than oratorical evidence of support, advises a look at the profits picture, specifically the slowing of the rate at which profits are rising. With reports in from 90 percent of the companies making up the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500-stock index, second-quarter earnings are estimated to have risen only 5 percent from the same period a year ago. That's hardly bullish. That second-quarter performance appears even weaker when compared with the first quarter's year-over-year increase of 22 percent, and with a 36 percent increase for the entire year 1988 vs. 1987. As measured by perhaps the most popular index of all, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, the indications of support are no stronger. Compared with a year earlier, second-quarter earnings of the 30 companies were down 5 percent. Many things move stock markets, and percentages such as these are only one of them. But there's one thing you can say about declines in profits or declines in the rate at which they are rising: They can not be ignored. Eventually, stock prices and earnings must reconcile their differences. They can not go separate ways for long, any more than the human heart and lungs can operate at their own individual tempos. Perhaps a better indication of the future might evolve from a government report due to be released this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of `` real'' corporate profits. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> believes the 7-year bull market has had a sound basis for much of its life, since operating profits _ excluding profits from price-inflated inventories and adjusted for depreciation _ did rise sustantially. But, it adds, over the past three years operating profits have n't been as impressive as they were earlier in the expansion In fact, it says, they've been unimpressive, and becoming more so. It expects this week's <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report to show signs of further profit deterioration.

 Stock prices pressed ahead today, extending the yearlong rally that carried the market to record highs on Thursday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 56.53 points Thursday to surpass the peak it reached two years ago, rose another 7.77 to 2,742.41 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 728 up, 687 down and 522 unchanged. The market appeared to pause as some traders cashed in the dramatic gains of stock prices lately. But prices generally held steady on the strength of the enthusiasm generated by Thursday's record high and the widespread public attention it received. Analysts say the market has been able to recoup the last of the losses it suffered in the crash of 1987 with help from increasing confidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> can restrain inflation without causing a recession. They also note that corporate earnings have risen sharply in the past two years, making the perceived risk in stocks less than it was when the market peaked out two years ago today. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LCB- at 132 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up | at 58 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, up 1 -LRB- at 47 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up 2 -RCB- at 161 -RCB- Some stocks that had run up Thursday on takeover rumors and speculation fell back.

<HEAD>British Car-Hire Firm Receives Friendly Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British vehicle rental and leasing company, announced Friday it has received a friendly offer that could lead to its eventual reunification with <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the international company. It said the bidder, <ORGANIZATION> Cilva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, valued <LOCATION> Avis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at 896.5 million pounds, the equivalent of $ 1.4 billion, or 600 pence a share. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> shares soared 32 pence to 592 pence on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> by midmorning. Cilva is 64.7-percent-owned by <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, a Luxembourg-based holding company which already owns 33.6 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION>'s existing shares. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> owns 8.8 percent of <LOCATION> Cilva </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has the rest. Cilva is said to have has assurances of an additional 26.4 percent of <LOCATION> Avis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s share capital, leaving 40 percent of <LOCATION> Avis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s shares outstanding. Avis <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s board, except for three individuals, has recommended that its shareholders take up the <LOCATION> Cilva </LOCATION> offer. Three years ago <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> owned <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, but was taken over in a leveraged buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Westray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consortium, which then floated 66 percent of <LOCATION> Avis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Relations between the two Avis groups remained friendly. <ORGANIZATION> Wesray </ORGANIZATION> sold <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to the rental company's employees in 1987. Lease International, consisting of two Belgian investors, was formed solely to hold <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, and said upon completing the offer an appropriate environment would exist for reuniting <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. This, it said, would enhance the growth prospects of both companies. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said they see `` strong commercial reasons'' for uniting the two <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> units, which will be easier and more highly leveraged under a private company structure. The announcement was seen as underlining <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s desire for a foothold in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before 1992, when the 12 nations of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> European Economic Community are to drop their trade barriers. In the financial year ended February, <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> reported a 31 percent rise in pretax profits to 72 million pounds.

<HEAD>UN Says Economic Sanctions Harm South Africa, But Are Not Foolproof</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The world is tightening its economic boycott of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but the apartheid state exploits loopholes such as foreign registration, mislabeling and third-party shipping to carry on trade, says a new report. Among the most vociferous proponents of sanctions are the black front-line states of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which ironically carry on considerable trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and are tied to it by railroads and power lines. These nations do not ban bilateral trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The report issued this week from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transnational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporations </ORGANIZATION> notes that in recent years the front-line states have become transshipment points for South African goods. Among other South African tactics cited in the report are these: _ Mislabeling export goods such as textiles sent to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, apples to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and wines to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> _ Illegal transfer of ownership on oil shipments to skirt the ban on such shipments from oil-producing states _ Transshipment of goods through other states <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s textile industry, for example, makes extensive use of foreign factories to complete the manufacture of fabrics and assemble garments _ Sending South African coal to European ports that do not ban it, primarily <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Anterp </LOCATION>, where it is mixed with other nations' coal to produce `` Dutch blend'' or simply relabeled as Dutch and transshipped _ Turning to the booming Far Eastern nations for increased trade as North American and European nations have tightened their sanctions Still, most governments have responded to appeals by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> for a voluntary sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the report notes. `` As a result, broad geographical and economic areas and sectors have been left outside the reach of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or avoidance practices in these areas have imposed additional costs on its economy,'' the report says. The Center notes that `` markets for South African products have declined in size, indicating that efforts to evade sanctions have been only partially successful.'' The report did not set an exact figure on the cost of sanctions to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but noted the country's economy has been weak through the 1980s with a growth rate below 1.5 percent a year. Official unemployment rates among South African blacks is at least 15 percent and unofficial estimates are much higher. In addition, the country has a foreign debt of $ 22 billion, three-fourths of it owed to transnational banks. The General Assembly has been urging nations and companies to shun <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1962. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> imposed a mandatory ban on arms trade with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1977. That spurred the country to develop its own arms industry, which has turned into a profitable export business. In 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> endorsed a voluntary embargo on new investments, export loan guarantees, the sale of <LOCATION> Krugerrand </LOCATION> gold coins, nuclear contracts and computer equipment. However, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have always vetoed resolutions that call for mandatory sanctions, saying that would hurt the black population. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plans hearings in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Sept. 4-6 on corporate links to South Africaand its colony <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.

 Grain and soybean futures closed lower Friday in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The selloff was attributed to the forecasts for rain in the plains states and the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> over the weekend and expectation of more precipitation next week, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. As a result of the rain, traders are expecting improved corn and soybean crop conditions next week, <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON> said.

The selloff in the corn and soybean pits spilled over into wheat futures, where the lack of new export sales also hurt prices. At the close, wheat was 3 -RCB- cents to 6 \ cents lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.90 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 1 -RCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.33 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3 \ cents lower with September at $ 1.34 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were a \ cent to 14 -RCB- cents lower with September at $ 5.81

 Stock prices retreated slightly in late trading today, the second anniversary of the peak that preceded the crash of 1987. The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks was down 3.61 points at 2,731.03 at 3 p.m. EDT. On Thursday _ one day short of the market peak's second anniversary _ the market's most famous barometer soared 56.53 points to surpass by 12 points its previous all-time high of Aug. 25, 1987. The 1987 peak was the start of a short but severe bear market that culminated in the worst day in Wall Street history, the 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrials on Oct. 19, 1987. Market analysts said the risk of a financial meltdown was far lower today than two years ago, and evidence of the 1987 debacle was hard to find this week. `` The quote of the day is something like: What crash?'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> arm of a Japanese brokerage firm, said Thursday Supporting the stock market in 1989 are a healthy dollar, relatively low interest rates and optimism that the economy will manage to steer a middle course between recession and high inflation. Most of all, there is no speculative bubble ready to be popped.

It's a buying panic,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON>, managing director for retail sales at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Rodman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Renshaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>.

A subdued cheer rose from the exchange floor after the close Thursday. `` A day like every other day _ no big deal,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, a specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was no question in everybody's mind that the market would get back to these levels.

When you call around, there's no reason. It just went up,'' <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> said. From its low point at the close of Black Monday to its close Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average rose 57 percent. `` While nobody's paid much attention to it, it's two of the strongest years, back to back, that we've had,'' <PERSON> Helfand </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Hearing Scheduled on Motion to Rescind Liquidation Decision</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A hearing has been scheduled next month to determine whether former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> will be allowed to reorganize his financial affairs to stave off liquidation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> scheduled a hearing Sept. 7 on whether <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s case should be converted back to a Chapter 11 reorganization, instead of the Chapter 7 liquidation decreed by the court July 28. `` We hope at this hearing to present the true perspective of this case and unmask the nature of the claimants,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said following a hearing Friday. In his motion before the court, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, who is appealing a securities conviction in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, claimed he was not given proper advance notification of plans to convert the case to Chapter 7, which allows the appointment of a trustee and liquidation of a debtor's assets. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, target of a flood of lawsuits following the collapse of his Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in March 1985, said he filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code in October 1987 in an attempt to consolidate the legal actions. `` I came to Chapter 11 not because I owed people money. I wanted to consolidate in one forum these many lawsuits,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. He contends a list of creditors, including the state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, seeking $ 4.5 billion are merely claimants. `` I do n't owe anybody anything,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The attorney general of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has stated that the losses in the closing of Home State have substantially been recovered. ... How can the state of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> justify having a claim of $ 275 million?'' In March 1987, the creditors obtained a federal court order that <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> pay back to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> $ 22 million needed to guarantee Home State deposits. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, 70, was convicted on <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> felony charges in Home State's collapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial He is appealing the state conviction and a $ 22 million restitution order.

 Two soybean traders and a clerk pleaded guilty Friday to charges of improper trading practices, while 12 others pleaded innocent in the government's probe of alleged fraud at the world's largest futures exchanges. All those who appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> were involved in soybean-trading activity at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> during a 2 -LCB- - year undercover probe by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents masquerading as traders The four remaining soybean traders charged are to be arraigned Sept. 7. A total of 45 traders and the clerk were indicted earlier this month after the investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The three who pleaded guilty Friday were freed on bond and have agreed to cooperate with the government in the remaining cases. They most likely will testify against co-defendants at upcoming trials, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnegan </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skrodski </PERSON>, 32, a soybean broker, admitted that he defrauded customers by making prearranged trades in 1987 that he profited from with others charged in the alleged scheme. He could be sentenced to a maximum of six years in prison and fined up to $ 350,000. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> LaCrosse </PERSON>, a 40-year-old father of four, admitted that he accepted an illegal prearranged trade from an undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent posing as a trader in August 1988. He also admitted that he `` aided and abetted'' defendant <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, accused of doctoring a trade to make it look as though LaCrosse had been involved in the deal, as a way to pay back money <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> owed LaCrosse. <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> was among the 12 soybean traders who pleaded innocent. LaCrosse also could face a maximum six-year prison term and $ 350,000 fine. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiser </PERSON>, a 21-year-old soybean clerk, said he helped execute prearranged trades between <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> and the undercover agent in August 1988, between <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Skrodksi </PERSON>, and between <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON> and defendant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vercillo </PERSON>, who pleaded innocent. <PERSON> Weiser </PERSON> also pleaded guilty to failing to file an income-tax return reporting his 1987 income _ approximately $ 7,700. He could be sentenced to a maximum four-year prison term and fined $ 400,000 on all charges. But prosecutors `` agreed that if he continues to provide substantial assistance'' in the probe, they likely will seek a lighter sentence, Ms. <PERSON> Finnegan </PERSON> said after the hearing. No sentencing date was set for the three. Besides <PERSON> Nowak </PERSON>, 47, and <PERSON> Vercillo </PERSON>, 44, soybean traders entering innocent pleas Friday were: <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Anixter </PERSON>, 40; <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashman </PERSON>, 28; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcal </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 35; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergstrom </PERSON>, 42; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 28; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, 52; <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetchenhier </PERSON>, 49; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenney </PERSON>, 35; <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittelstadt </PERSON>, 49; and <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>, 46. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> set a Feb. 5 trial date for the 12 traders.

<HEAD>Fed Decided To Lower Interest Rates Last Month</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal Reserve policymakers voted to nudge interest rates lower in July, but they worried about reigniting inflation by going too far, according to minutes of the meeting released Friday. The Federal Open Market Committee, noting fairly consistent weakness in housing and consumer spending, voted 10-1 at the end of its July 5-6 meeting to lower short-term interest rates. Subsequently, the benchmark federal funds rate _ the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans _ fell twice, in quarter-point increments, to 9 percent. It was the third credit-easing move by the central bank since early June after the federal funds rate hit a peak of more than 9.75 percent. The first loosening move had ended a year-long program that increased the rate by three percentage points in an effort to squelch inflationary pressures. However, since last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has held interest rates steady and the minutes indicate many members believed additional easing would be unwise `` in the absence of further indications of lagging economic growth.'' `` Many emphasized that current economic and financial uncertainties called for caution in adjusting policy at this point,'' the minutes said. `` In this view, more than a slight move to less restraint could have an undesireable effect on inflationary expectations.'' `` In the view of some members, there remained some risk that inflationary pressures would intensify and that the easing might have to be reversed later,'' the minutes said. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> was the only committee member to dissent and <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, who earlier had announced his intention to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, was absent. The minutes indicate <PERSON> Seger </PERSON> believed the economy had slowed `` substantially'' and likely would weaken further next year unless the central bank pushed rates down more sharply than the majority decided. The open market committee is composed of the seven <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> governors and five of the 12 presidents of regional <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>. It meets privately about eight times a year. It aims to provide enough growth in the money supply to keep the economy out of a recession but also to avoid overheated growth that could accelerate inflation. The committee issues directives that govern the open market desk of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. Through purchases or sales of government securities, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> influences the amount of money banks have available to make loans and thus the price of those loans, interest rates. The July directive to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bank, in <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> parlance, was `` neutral.'' The members decided that after the rate decline in July, `` some firming or some easing ... would be acceptable ... depending on indications of inflationary pressures -LRB- and -RRB- the strength of the business expansion.'' The open market committee met again on Tuesday, but minutes from that gathering wo n't be made public until three days after the next meeting on Oct. 3. Inflation has cooled recently, but most analysts, pointing to signs the economy may be rebounding from sluggishness in the first half, believe the committee decided at its latest meeting to continue an even-handed policy. The unemployment rate dipped to 5.2 percent in July and retail sales rose 0.9 percent. Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent from January through May, but fell to a little less than half of that in June and July as gasoline and food prices eased. The July meeting also sets monetary targets for the rest of the year and preliminary targets for the following year. The committee voted unanimously for a growth target this year of 3 percent to 7 percent for a broad measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking and savings accounts and money market mutual funds. However, the committee split 10-1 in recommending that the same target be maintained in 1990, breaking with the recent practice of reducing the target annually. <PERSON> Silas </PERSON> <PERSON> Keehn </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, dissented, the minutes said, because he believed `` a reduction of the ranges for the next year would provide an important signal of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- continuing commitment to price stability.''

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Expected to Creep Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat production is up from last year's drought-shriveled harvest but not enough to forestall another drain on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain reserves and an upward creep in prices, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday The analysis by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was based on the Aug. 10 estimate that wheat production would be about 2.04 billion bushels, up 13 percent from the 1988 harvest. Wheat use, including exports, is expected to be 2.29 billion bushels in the marketing year that began on June 1, down 5 percent from 1988-89. `` With <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm prices expected near the target price -LRB- $ 4 per bushel -RRB- in 1989-90, and increased competitor supplies, exports may decline more than 10 percent to less than 1.3 billion bushels,'' the report said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of world trade is expected to slip as well.'' At the end of the 1988-89 wheat marketing year, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had about 694 million bushels from previous harvests in its stockpile. And this June 1 `` carryover'' was down from more than 1.26 billion bushels a year earlier. By next June 1, the report said, the wheat stockpile will be trimmed further to an estimated 474 million bushels, down more than 30 percent and the smallest carryover since 1974-75. Most of the reduction will occur in the inventories held by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as forfeited collateral for price-support loans made to producers. Other reductions will be in the `` farmer-owned reserve'' of wheat stored under loan and released to the market as prices rise and the loans become due. `` Area planted increased 17 percent in response to attractive prices and less acreage idled under annual government programs, but yields are forecast to be the lowest since 1978'' because of lingering drought in major wheat production areas, the report said. Because of the continued tight wheat supply, the government has lowered the land-idling requirement for 1990 to 5 percent of the base acreage, down from 10 percent for 1989 and 27.5 percent in 1988. That is land farmers must take from production in order to qualify for federal supports. Wheat prices are projected to average in the range of $ 3.85 to $ 4.25 per bushel in the 1989-90 marketing year, up from $ 3.72 estimated for 1988-89.

A follow-through to Thursday's rally was cut short by wary investors who chose to cash in their recent gains. _ THE WINNERS: Airline stocks, buoyed by takeover speculation rather than solid economic fundamentals, have helped carry the market upward in recent months Airline stocks lagged in Thursday's rally but surged ahead again Friday <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> gained another $ 10 a share to $ 278. _ THE LOSERS: Precious metals stocks do n't usually do well in bull markets because paper brings a better return than gold and silver Mining companies like <ORGANIZATION> ASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hecla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> lost ground on Thursday and were little changed Friday. _ WHAT'S AHEAD: Stock analysts will be keeping an eye on the outlook for inflation and economic growth The coming week will bring a slew of economic statistics, including a revision of the second-quarter gross national product, July personal income and factory orders, and August unemployment figures.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said Friday he was considering a sale of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> because the `` noise'' at strike-torn <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was hurting the sister carrier's business In an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said the sale of part or all of Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> was under discussion partly because of the negative impact from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s bitter strike and bankruptcy proceeding. `` We have to be responsible to our shareholders,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said in his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. `` We have an obligation to look for alternatives ... -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- has been impacted by the noise level from all of our friends over in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.'' He made the surprise announcement about <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday in response to a question at a company meeting. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March 9, five days after pilots, Machinists and flight attendants walked off the job. Eastern has been reorganizing as a smaller carrier and has hired non-union workers. The spillover from the Eastern situation has eroded bookings on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flights and cut into its profits in the second quarter, said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> is the parent of the two carriers. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> showed a net profit of $ 32.1 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $ 150.9 million a year earlier. Continental could benefit from `` distance'' from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said. He cited the success of the Trump Shuttle, which enjoyed a sharp rise in passenger traffic as soon as developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought it from Eastern in early June for $ 365 million. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> stressed, however, a full or partial sale of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are merely being considered as possible options and a final decision has n't yet been made. `` We have been approached'' by parties interested in a possible sale, he said. Despite the strife at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s reputation as a fare-cutting carrier with inferior service, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> stock has soared from around $ 9 or $ 10 a share at the beginning of the year to over $ 20 currently. It rose 87 -LCB- cents Friday to close at $ 20.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, after jumping as high as $ 22.25. Possible buyers of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> or part of it could include Scandinavian Airlines System, which has a 10 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has expressed a desire to merge with another airline. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, foreign airlines are allowed to buy up to 25 percent of American carriers. There also has been speculation that <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, may be interested in a combination with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, however, appears to have rejected the idea of a merger with another airline, according to a source close to the company who asked not to be named. That would make more likely a buyout from an investor group, possibly including <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> or another foreign carrier. <ORGANIZATION> SAS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Levites </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON>, both in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, declined comment on the matter Friday. An <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> associate did n't immediately return a call seeking comment. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> would carry a sale price of about $ 2 billion if it were sold in its entirety, and <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> may be trying to find out what the carrier could fetch, some analysts suggested. `` The worst may be over and it surprises me he -LRB- <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> -RRB- would be considering a major sale,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> may be seeking to capitalize on the takeover frenzy sweeping the airline industry, which could make struggling <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> a hot property. A group led by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> recently acquired <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4 billion, while <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is being ardently pursued by investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and others.

 Cocoa futures prices plunged Friday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as traders looked ahead to next month's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> with an expectation of failure. On other markets, copper prices reached new contract highs, grain and soybean futures plunged, precious metals declined, oil futures were down and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Cocoa settled $ 37 to $ 47 lower with the contract for delivery in September at $ 1,066 a metric ton. The selloff in cocoa futures followed <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION>'s revision of its forecast for the 1988-1989 world cocoa surplus, raising the figure by 40,000 metric tons to 263,000 metric tons from its May forecast. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said speculators led Friday's selloff. `` The market is looking forward to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> next month,'' <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps the organization can come up with new price support measures. But the principal players -LRB- in the market -RRB- are looking at it as a likely failure.'' The ICO meeting of cocoa producers and consumers is to take place Sept. 11. Cocoa prices have been depressed in recent years by five consecutive years of surplus crops. The surplus has hurt the economies of major cocoa-producing nations such as the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Copper futures hit new contract highs on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as production problems around the world continue to push up prices. Copper was up by 4.70 cents to 6.80 cents, with the August contract at $ 1.373 a pound. In addition to a paralyzing strike in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, copper production is hampered by a strike at the <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> mines in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>; the bankruptcy of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Cananea </LOCATION> mine, which is expected to be closed for up to three months; and the shutdown of the <LOCATION> Bougainville </LOCATION> mines in <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION> due to terrorist activities by landowners. `` Current production problems are so severe the rally will have to continue through early September,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Grain and soybean futures were lower in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> due to forecasts for rain in the plains states and the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> over the weekend and expectations of more precipitation next week. Slack export sales and a drop in processor demand also were cited as a cause of the selloff in soybeans and corn. The selloff in the corn and soybean pits spilled over into wheat futures, where the lack of new export sales also hurt prices. Wheat was 3 \ cents to 6 \ cents lower with September at $ 3.90 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents to 1 -LCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.32 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 3 \ cents lower with September at $ 1.34 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 \ cent to 16 \ cents lower with September at Precious metal futures continued their retreat on the Comex, with gold $ 3.70 to $ 3.90 lower with August at $ 360.70 a troy ounce; silver was 6 cents to 7.4 cents lower with September at $ 5.115 a troy ounce. Oil futures closed lower in listless trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The market is awaiting an injection of fresh news,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritterbusch </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Carson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Chicago-area oil distributor. Analysts say the general market tone is negative because of overproduction by some members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 11 cents lower to 10 cents higher with September at $ 17.94 a barrel; heating oil was .27 cents lower to .24 cent higher with September at 51.43 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .28 cent to .85 cent lower with September at 53.30 cents a gallon. Livestock and pork futures where mixed in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with September at 73.60 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .43 cent lower with August at 83.67 cents a pound; hogs were .30 cent lower to .5 cent higher with October at 41.32 cents a pound; pork bellies were .65 cent lower to .40 cent higher with February at 41.62 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices fell Friday after traders dumped <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities in a late-afternoon selloff, market watchers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond fell 11-32 of a point, or $ 3.44 for every $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.18 percent from 8.15 percent late Thursday. There was little economic news to move the market, analysts said. Trading was slow until mid-afternoon, said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, an investment broker with <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Then, the sale of some mortgage issues prompted dealers to sell <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues, he said `` Dealers bought the mortgage issues and tried to hedge them by selling Treasuries,'' he said. Also, he said, `` The market has tended to sell off the last few Fridays.'' In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues fell 3-32 to 5-32 point, intermediate maturities fell 7-32 point and long-term issues were down \ point to 11-32 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.78 to 1,174.61. In corporate trading, industrials were up slightly. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, rose 0.07 to 328.61 Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.22 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.96 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.33 percent as the discount rose 6 basis points to 7.90 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.31 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to 7.72 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted late in the day at 8 15-16 percent, down from 9 1-16 percent late Thursday.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> on Friday outlined his $ 6.19 billion bid to buy <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with details that at least one analyst said should please everyone involved. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the financing package for the $ 275-a-share deal includes $ 7 billion in bank financing and $ 1 billion in equity to cover the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' parent, refinance certain debts, provide working capital and pay related expenses. `` In addition, Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has stated his intention to pursue an Employee Stock Ownership Plan, in which all employee and labor groups would be invited to participate, thereby rewarding them for their role in building <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> and providing them with an additional opportunity to benefit from their continued efforts on behalf of the company,'' a statement said. `` With this financing information, the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> board should now be in a position to take action on our proposal,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. He said he has asked <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> to advise him of its decision by the close of business on Aug. 31. `` The financing plan is entirely consistent with our goals for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>: it allows for the continued implementation of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s growth and expansion plans, including new aircraft and capital equipment, but does not contemplate the disposition of any <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> assets, nor any ` bust-up' of the company, in whole or in part,'' he said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, a spokesman for Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment on the plan. Also Friday, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> met in his <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office with members of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the biggest share of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> workers. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is seeking their support for his bid, and a spokesman said the meeting was `` constructive.'' `` The Machinists people made Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> aware of some of their concerns with respect to labor, and he gave them some assurances with respect to the future of the airline,'' said the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> spokesman, who asked not to be identified. He said both sides plan additional meetings to discuss <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' bid. The unions representing <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> machinists and the carrier's pilots are considered crucial to any sale <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' decision to outline his financing plans likely was aimed in part at discouraging other potential bidders, said <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I think by announcing the full financing available ... he's showing he could'' go even higher, said <PERSON> Marckesano </PERSON>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge on Friday ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to throw a wrench in takeover plans by a British investment group. At issue is the right of a state agency, in this case the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION>, to review a takeover bid involving foreign companies. <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has made an offer for Farmers' parent, <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Farmers is based in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has filed lawsuits in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and eight other states claiming that it is unconstitutional to subject <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover bid to state regulatory review. The company's position is that the <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> offer is strictly a British securities transaction out of the reach of state regulatory review. Farmers had filed motions to dismiss <PERSON> Hoylake </PERSON>'s case in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> denied that request on Friday. At the same time, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> denied <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION>'s request for a preliminary injunction against the state insurance commission review. <PERSON> Hoylake </PERSON> said it would appeal the judge's ruling as soon as possible. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribe </PERSON> characterized the takeover bid as a `` wholly-foreign securities transaction.'' Subjecting it to state agency reviews `` not only exceeds the constitutional limitations on state authority, but imposes an unfair burden on foreign companies,'' he said. Similar lawsuits have been filed in eight other states where Farmers does business: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> adviser said there have been no rulings in those cases, which, like the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case, were filed in late July. <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> launched the $ 21 billion takeover bid in July. BAT promised an aggressive fight against the takeover, saying the investor group was made up of `` destroyers.''

 Though some first-time investors who were scared away by the stock market crash two years ago never returned, those who remained got their reward, market-watchers say. The record high of 2,734.64 in the Dow Jones industrials average Thursday once again pointed out the value of a long-term investment strategy, these observers said Friday. Anyone who held stocks for the past two years has about broken even, while people who panicked and sold at the bottom took big losses.

 Federal Reserve policymakers voted to nudge interest rates lower in July, but they worried about reigniting inflation by going too far, according to minutes of the meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee, noting fairly consistent weakness in housing and consumer spending, voted 10-1 at the end of its July 5-6 meeting to lower short-term interest rates, according to the minutes released Friday. Subsequently, the benchmark federal funds rate _ the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans _ fell twice, in quarter-point increments, to 9 percent.
