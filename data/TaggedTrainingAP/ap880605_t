<HEAD>Sentence Review for Convicted Terrorists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government will review the life sentences of dozens of convicted terrorist prisoners in this <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province, officials said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> will review the records of the Special Category inmates over the next six months and report back to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, his office reported. No reason was given for the review, but it appeared aimed at reducing tensions. The Special Category laws for suspected terrorists in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s sectarian warfare were introduced in 1972 after inmates staged a hunger strike at <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>'s Maze Prison, demanding to be treated as political prisoners. Their special privileges include political status and allow them to avoid prison work, wear their own clothes, have extra visits and food parcels and to live in isolated groups. In 1976, the Special Category status was ended for crimes committed after that date and in 1980 no more prisoners were admitted to the category. There are now 90 Special Category prisoners compared with 1,500 in 1975. There are 31 members of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, 27 of the mainly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and 32 from the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. All but five are serving life sentences or are detained on orders of the secretary of state. The predminantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>.

 A 10 -LCB- - foot alligator lunged from a residential lake, seized a 4-year-old girl who was wading with her brother and a friend and dragged her to her death Game officers spotted the alligator on the bank of Hidden Lake around midnight carrying the limp body of <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glover </PERSON> in its jaws. The reptile was immediately shot to death with a .357 - caliber Magnum pistol, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> disaster services The girl's body was recovered, he said. Since 1948, there have been 95 unprovoked alligator attacks in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with five previous deaths, said game commission Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrior </PERSON>. `` An autopsy of the alligator was performed on the scene and determined it to be the -LRB- alligator that killed her -RRB-,'' <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> dispatcher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kefer </PERSON> said Sunday. He did not know what aspect of the autopsy identified the reptile as the killer. <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> was walking along the lake's south shore with her brother <PERSON> Justin </PERSON>, 8, their dog, and neighbor <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Kershanick </PERSON>, 9, at 6:30 p.m. Saturday when the gator bolted from the water and snapped up the girl in its teeth. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> said Sunday that the children were walking in ankle-deep water. `` The little girl was throwing rocks and kicking the water. While she was kicking, she must have kicked the alligator. Right when she stopped kicking, the alligator jumped up out of the water and started biting her two times in the stomach,'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> said. `` Then he dropped her and she crawled away, and then he got out of the water more and grabbed her from the back and went in the water.'' `` After it happened, then we ran,'' he added. `` It was pretty quick. It seemed like a nightmare, a dream. But then the way she screamed, when I saw the blood after he went in, then I realized it was real.'' Alligators tend to pull their prey underwater, drowning them and stashing the body for later feeding. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Kershanick </PERSON> went to the lake with a pistol after his son alerted him. `` I saw it taking her off to the other side'' of the lake, <PERSON> Kershanik </PERSON> said. `` I tried to track it through the weeds, but by the time I got there he went under with her, and that was the last I seen of him.'' Neighbor <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> said he had heard <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s mother screaming and took a rifle to the lake. He said he saw a large alligator surface with a light-colored object in its mouth. `` It was within rifle range but I was afraid to shoot because of the object,'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> said. The gator was spotted after five divers had searched the lake and weeds surrounded by the Gardens of Gulf Cove development while six <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Game and <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> officers and several deputies and emergency workers walked the land. The area is about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s west coast. `` It was a shock. It will be a while getting over it,'' <PERSON> Erin </PERSON>'s stepfather, <PERSON> Ty </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowns </PERSON>, said outside the family's house `` All the kids around here played around all these lakes. I do n't think anybody took the alligators all that seriously. <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> was staying with neighbors after the incident. <PERSON> Kershanick </PERSON>'s wife, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, said nothing had been done about past alligator complaints. `` A lot of them are aggravated because they've complained about the alligators being here, but nobody does anything,'' she said. `` They ought to have the ponds fenced in.'' Alligators once were vigorously hunted and their population dwindled in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. They were made a protected species in the mid-1960s. But in the past few years, it has become clear that the species is in no danger of extinction, said <PERSON> Farrior </PERSON>. State wildlife experts estimate there are 1 million alligators on 6.7 million acres of land. On Sept. 1, for the first time since 1962, the state will hold a one-month gator hunt in which no more than 3,000 are to be taken. `` They occupy pretty much any body of water that would look like an alligator lives there, and lots that do n't,'' <PERSON> Farrior </PERSON> said. Last year, 3,853 gators were killed because they were declared a nuisance, threatening children and livestock. The attack on <PERSON> Erin </PERSON> was the third gator attack on the Gulf Coast in the past six months. Both previous victims survived the attacks.

 Huddled in the depths of a coal mine, six trapped miners take turns banging hammers together to signal rescuers. Their colleagues keep as still as possible to save precious air. `` Lie down, move as little as you can, drink the water in sips and breath as regularly as possible,'' veteran miner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON> barks to his five-man crew. Toward the end of their 65-hour ordeal, their oxygen almost gone, the men hear a rescue worker screaming into his walkie-talkie: `` I see a light! I see two lights, I see three lights! I see people alive!'' The drama begins at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, when a gas explosion traps 57 men in the mine in this town 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON> and his five-man crew race toward the exit of the 500-foot-deep shaft. `` Maybe the blasting material storeroom blew up,'' the strapping, 36-year-old <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON> says to himself. Out of the darkness, illuminated by the lights on the miners' helmets, appears the figure of a colleague staggering toward them <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON> instantly recognizes the symptoms of the miners' dreaded foe _ carbon monoxide. He yells, `` Turn back, turn back!'' <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON> and his crew head in the other direction. Other men nearby race toward the exit, into certain death from mounting levels of carbon monoxide that filled the tunnels. <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON>'s crew, wearing emergency masks containing about 45 minutes' worth of oxygen, rush to a point more than a mile from the blast site in the underground labyrinth of tunnels. Guided by the flames of cigarette lighters, they search for a space free of the deadly gas. Finally, the group finds air _ and a chance for survival. `` Be quiet, so you use up less oxygen,'' Gepperth orders. Huddled in the dark are: _ <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dehn </ORGANIZATION>, a bearded, 36-year-old father of two _ <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesner </PERSON>, 27, engaged to be married in August _ <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Roese </PERSON>, 33, married two years and the father of one _ <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Doench </PERSON>, at 21 the youngest of the group Just four weeks earlier he'd walked away unharmed from a car wreck. _ <PERSON> Ahmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Batkan </PERSON>, 33 The Turkish immigrant has two children and his wife is expecting a third. The sixth man is <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON>, who is married. He often sports a diamond earring in his left ear. The men start shouting frantically into their walkie-talkies: `` One north 4-5, one north 4-5 six people.'' They hope to give rescue workers their precise location. Radio contact is made. But a radio operator orders the men to stop sending distress calls so he can try to reach other possible survivors. They try using the walkie-talkies again later but ca n't make contact The miners sit in the dark _ having turned off their miners' lamps to save batteries _ with their only nourishment a sandwich and mineral water Taking turns, they pound two hammers together in rhythmic blows to try to catch rescuers' attention. The banging goes on for nearly 65 hours. <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON> tells his men to remember the `` Miracle of Lengede'' _ in which 11 miners were pulled to the surface two weeks after water flooded an iron mine in <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saxony </LOCATION> in 1963. Some of the men start to make last wills and testaments, but <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON> gruffly tells them `` You do n't have to do that.'' <PERSON> Gepperth </PERSON> senses that the deadly carbon monoxide levels are advancing toward them, and the group retreats into the furthest recesses of the mine. Finally, their backs are against the wall. They can go no further and must stay in a prison-like space 6 -LCB- feet high and 8 feet wide. After waiting in vain Thursday, the men hear drilling on Friday. But it stops at mid-afternoon. <PERSON> Gesner </PERSON> says to himself: `` Have they forgotten us or something? Maybe they figure it's not worth it.'' He starts imagining he sees lights coming toward him, but there's no one there. They keep tapping, louder and louder. On Friday night, rescuers above think they've heard something. Hours pass. Then one of the trapped men screams: `` They've drilled a hole! At 4:21 a.m. Saturday, the rescue worker calls that he's found the men. A little more than an hour after they're discovered, the men are hoisted to the surface. After all 57 miners had been given up for dead, the `` Miracle of Borken'' had occurred.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final meeting with major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners, coming just two weeks after the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, will focus on both macro and micro, from averting another stock market crash to debating whether longer shopping hours might ignite more economic growth in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will meet with leaders of six other major industrial democracies _ <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ plus the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in the downtown convention center of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s biggest city, June 19-21. The economic summit will give <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> an opportunity to brief his partners on his May 29-June 2 talks with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. However, two of the participants, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Noburu </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> got an early report from the president during his <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stop last week. <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, hoping that a favorable impression will bolster its bid to host the 1996 Olympic Games, is busy sprucing up for an expected invasion of 1,400 summit delegates and 5,000 news media representatives. The city has a graffiti squad scrubbing everything clean. A giant parking lot is being converted into `` Summit Square'' where reporters will be offered free food and drink around the clock. To guard against terrorist attacks, 3,000 police officers will be deployed around the city and sharpshooters will be stationed on rooftops along motorcade routes to prevent anyone from getting within a bomb's throw of visiting foreign leaders. The security operation will cost an estimated $ 6 million, the equivalent of $ 4.8 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are taking the precautions because of the history -LRB- of terrorist attacks -RRB- at previous summit conferences,'' said police Supt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadeau </PERSON>. Rockets were fired in downtown <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> at the 1986 economic summit and bombs were thrown at embassies in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> during last year's <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> summit. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, in office since 1979, will be dean of the summiteers. This will be <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eighth such summit. Newcomers at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit will be <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>. Also attending will be West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who will bring his new premier, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>. Host Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> wants the 14th economic summit _ the annual parleys began in 1975 at <LOCATION> Rambouillet </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> _ to be less formal and more productive than its predecessors. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has ruled out the usual opening day festivities in favor of getting right down to business. He plans to start with an afternoon working session on economic issues, followed by a working dinner on political matters. At the dinner, `` clearly the the overarching theme will be East-West relations,'' says <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. The second summit day will see an innovation _ a 90-minute meeting without aides at which the leaders will toss around ideas about prospects for the next decade. They are to discuss economics on the final day before closing with a news conference. `` It's essential that this summit concentrate rather heavily on economic issues,'' said <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostry </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s multilateral trade ambassador. `` The summit is the terminal day of what is almost a continuing process of international economic cooperation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ostry </PERSON> said the two major summit issues will be: _ How to manage the transition from huge trade deficits and surpluses to balanced global trade _ How to prevent a repetition of the Oct. 19 stock market crash The crash did not result in a recession, as some experts had predicted, but continued growth has raised fears of a new inflationary spiral. To avert that danger, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> this week pushed interest rates to a two-year high, with prime rates rising to 10.75 percent. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is urging the seven summit nations to adopt an index of 35 to 40 key commodities, including gold, to help track inflation. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposed last month that they also closely monitor growth rates and trade balances to better coordinate their economies, in addition to watching exchange and interest rates and fiscal policies. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are expected to press the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for progress in the farm subsidy war that is crippling treasuries, driving down prices and restricting markets. Summit leaders also are expected to consider options for solving the Third World debt problem, in which 121 developing countries owe a total of $ 1.25 trillion. Commercial banks want governments to increase contributions to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. With monetary policies already being closely monitored, Canadian officials said the summit emphasis may focus on `` micro-economic'' policies such as taxation, deregulation, land use restrictions in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or extension of West German shopping hours to boost imports.

 The bedposts are artificial trees, and the suite's private whirlpool is nestled in a crop of synthetic rocks complete with a mini-waterfall. The walls are a deep-green painted forest. Welcome to the treehouse suite, part of the new fantasy wing of the <LOCATION> Burnsville </LOCATION> Royale Hotel. For $ 165 to $ 195 a night, guests also can retire to an igloo, a whaling ship, a sheik's tent, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> beach, a 1973 Olds or any of a number of settings at this latest addition to <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Dehring </PERSON>'s growing chain of fantasy hotels `` We're really just another hotel company that has a part of its business that's a little unusual,'' said <PERSON> Dehring </PERSON>, 43, of <LOCATION> Minnetonka </LOCATION>, owner of the refurbished <LOCATION> Burnsville </LOCATION> motel and similar outposts in the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> towns of <LOCATION> Antigo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dodgeville </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>. Before the fantasy wing opened here in May, the hotel had the usual trappings for travelers: convention and meeting rooms, a restaurant, swimming pool and 88 standard rooms for $ 42 to $ 50 per-night. `` In addition, we have this one wing that looks like any other hotel wing _ until you open the -LRB- room -RRB- door,'' <PERSON> Dehring </PERSON> said. In the Moby <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> suite, guests are confronted with the wide-open mouth of a whale. The whirlpool _ mandatory fare in the 12 fantasy suites _ is inside the behemoth, ribs showing through a ceiling of whale stomach. Then there's the car suite. `` Bring back the memories,'' bids the promotion on the hotel fare sheet. `` The stars, the moon and young loves' first kiss in the backseat.'' The beach room, bedless, offers sleep on a beige carpet randomly padded to give the impression of sand. `` Pharoah's Tomb'' puts you inside a pyramid with sand - and cement-sprayed walls cracked to lend a more realistic look and feel `` It's a very definite, authentic feeling. Whatever authentic is. I have n't been there either,'' <PERSON> Dehring </PERSON> said. The story of <ORGANIZATION> Royale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the Bloomington-based parent company of <PERSON> Dehring </PERSON>'s four hotels, began at the Don Q. Inn in <LOCATION> Dodgeville </LOCATION>. The Don Q. offers such oddities as a 120-year-old barn for a restaurant and a steeple converted into a suite. <PERSON> Dehring </PERSON> bought it in 1979 and quickly learned that something out of the ordinary is something in demand. `` We've kind of been expounding on it ever since,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON>, hotel group president. The two are full of ideas for more elaborate _ maybe impossible _ suites. They picture guests sleeping on a 27-foot boat floating in real water, `` God and code willing,'' <PERSON> Dehring </PERSON> says. Another idea is a hot-air balloon. Such a suite probably would have to be a three-story affair, they said. Expansion of the chain is more than a brainstorm. Contracts have been signed for the purchase of new properties in <LOCATION> Muscatine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. With the <LOCATION> Burnsville </LOCATION> specialty rooms already booked for the summer, <PERSON> Dehring </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isabella </PERSON> think it will pay to build more of the unexpected at their fifth and sixth hotels. They'll entertain all ideas. In fact, they give guests `` suite suggestion'' cards that solicit names and concepts for future rooms and promise a free night for winners.

 A huge blimp-like balloon floating serenely in the southern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> sky is a new weapon in a widening war, a radar-packed eye-in-the-sky searching for airborne drug smugglers. When it becomes fully operational this month, the nearly $ 18 million balloon will scan the sky to the south, tracking low-flying planes that try to evade regular radar, and helping <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> aircraft chase smugglers within 80,000 square miles. The helium-filled, white balloon already has tracked planes twice, leading to arrests and seizure of drugs, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, senior engineer and site manager for the contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. It is the first of at least five balloons Customs officials hope to position along the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> border to plug gaps in ground-based radar surveillance that have allowed smugglers to enter the country with impunity via <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Some residents near the giant balloon's mooring on the southern edge of the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huachuca </LOCATION> military reservation say they're worried that it poses a danger to them. `` I'm sure the government's going to leave it there until it has an accident, and then things will change. And it ultimately will have an accident,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, whose home is within the radius of the balloon's 10,000-foot-long tether. Within the balloon's range are 1,000 homes, five churches and <ORGANIZATION> Huachuca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Southland </PERSON>, a second-grade teacher, is among those who appreciate its deterrent role in the war on drugs. `` I just do n't think the risk is there,'' she said. `` I do n't think the balloon's gon na run away through the neighborhood and carry off the children. Army and Customs officials say the site was the best available and fears of an accident are unfounded. The balloon has a rapid deflation device to allow operators to lower it quickly while controlling where it lands if it were to break from its tether. Sabotage would be the most likely cause of a breakaway from the mooring, but it would be a difficult target for anything but a rocket, <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said. Because of the helium's low pressure, `` you could put probably a dozen -LRB- bullet -RRB- holes in this Aerostat out here and it would probably take us days to even find out we had a leak,'' he said. The balloon goes by various names: Aerostat -LRB- for air stationary -RRB- Borne Radar Surveillance System; SOWRBALL -LRB- Southwest Radar Balloon -RRB-; `` Fat <PERSON> Albert </PERSON>,'' and even `` <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamu </PERSON>,'' after the whale of Sea World fame. At 245 feet long and 72 feet in diameter, it dwarfs a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. It weighs 12,750 pounds, including the 3,500-pound down-looking radar payload strapped to its underbelly. But its eight-layered skin is puff-pastry thin _ at 12 mils, or 12-thousandths of an inch, it's about twice the thickness of the tape in an audio cassette. That high-technology skin has high-intensity strength: about 275 pounds per linear inch, <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said. The Aerostat is anchored at a maximum height of 10,000 feet by another high-tech wonder: a tether less than an inch in diameter and made of <LOCATION> Kevlar </LOCATION>, a lightweight material used in bulletproof vests. The tether weighs 4,250 pounds but can handle tension of more than 75,000 pounds. Inside the Kevlar are three wires providing power for the radar package and other computerized controls, all run by ground-station crew in an around-the-clock command center. `` What we have here is the latest technology in aerostats,'' <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said.

The balloon is intended to operate except in snow or icy conditions, thunderstorms or heavy winds, conditions likely to keep smugglers grounded. `` These cats are n't gon na be flying through those thunderstorms either,'' <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels are closer than ever to ending their 6 -LCB- - year war, but the last few steps to halt the fighting will be the most difficult The final measures are particularly crucial for the rebels, known as Contras, who may negotiate themselves out of existence in peace talks scheduled to resume Tuesday. The rebels do not have the political structure to survive as a separate organization on the Nicaraguan political scene. Their role likely will be taken over by the political parties already established in the country. Despite their rhetoric and posturing, the Contras and the government have been getting closer to a permanent agreement and have set a temporary truce that no one wants to break. The two sides signed a preliminary agreement on March 23 in <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION>, a small village on the Costa Rican border. A 60-day cease-fire, which expired last Tuesday, has been extended until the two sides renew their discussions in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital. During the last negotiating session, the government agreed to discuss some political reforms the Contra leadership considers essential. These include calls for political pluralism, equality before the law, the right to strike and a pluralistic electoral system. The reforms deal with definitions of `` democratization'' _ concepts that first led to the war, which has killed more than 26,000 people and ruined the country's economy. The Contra leadership feels the Sandinista regime is undemocratic, repressive and based on Marxism-Leninism. `` When it comes to definition of freedom of the press, civil rights, human rights, democracy, we are using the same words with different meanings. We are talking about two interpretations of reality based on different ideologies,'' said <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am reasonably optimistic there will be an agreement,'' he said. `` It is not a question here of defeating the government at the negotiating table, but of finding a way to live together.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> <PERSON> Leiva </PERSON>, a Contra adviser, said, `` The government must learn to live with what they term petite bourgeoisie. We can live with some of their leaders.'' <PERSON> Bayardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, deputy coordinator of the political commission of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There are some in the opposition who have realized that there is political room for them here.'' <PERSON> Arce </PERSON> rejected charges that the government is trying to impose a communist state. `` We came to power talking about building socialism in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But as we developed our struggle, we understood the national realities and we opted for a system of mixed economy with private and government property.'' <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> `` pragmatic and opportunistic'' but said there was little chance of a definite agreement on democratic reforms. `` Democratization is utopian in a country like ours where there has been no democracy for more than 60 years,'' he said. `` What we need is a continued process of democratic practices to test the political will of the government.'' `` If we do not agree on this,'' he said, `` the government will act unilaterally enacting electoral laws, and other changes that will make it look good abroad, while still talking to a divided opposition.'' The Sandinista government already has announced plans for municipal elections before the 1990 presidential elections. Opposition party leaders believe the Contras, as an organization, served a purpose in forcing the government to the negotiating table, but are at their weakest while negotiating an end to the war. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said they will have to return and rejoin one of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s 14 political parties or form another party, `` which is the last thing <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> needs,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Scientist Says Crop Circles Caused By Whirlwinds, Not Flying
Saucers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mysterious circles of flattened crops in the British countryside over the centuries have been caused by stationary whirlwinds and not ghosts or UFOs, a scientist said Saturday. About 50 of the circles, with diameters of 10 to 100 feet, show up every summer usually in fields of long grass, barley, oats or wheat near hills, said tornado expert <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Meaden </PERSON>. Speaking at a conference in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, he dismissed speculation the circles were caused by flying saucers, helicopters flying upside down, supernatural beings or even herds of rotating hedgehogs, a small porcupine. `` Wind usually blows round both sides of a hill and merges smoothly round the other side,'' <PERSON> Meaden </PERSON> said. `` However, sometimes there is a gust on one side but not the other which creates vortices or sudden whirlwinds. These sink to the ground and flatten crops in a spiral.'' <PERSON> Meaden </PERSON> said the Tornado and <ORGANIZATION> Storm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Bradford </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where he works, investigated 150 crop circles over the past eight years.

 An alligator grabbed a 4-year-old girl walking along the shores of a pond and dragged her underwater Saturday as two horrified playmates watched, police said. The girl, who was not identified, remained missing after an extensive search, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> deputies said. She was walking at the edge of the pond at the Gardens of Gulf Cove development at about 6:30 p.m. when the alligator lunged from the water, said sheriff's Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` The child was forcibly dragged into the water by the alligator,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` Our rescue units and dive teams have conducted an extensive search and the child has not yet been located.'' A neighbor, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Triplett </PERSON>, said the girl's 6-year-old brother and a friend who is about 7 witnessed the attack. The children were walking a dog, she said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rescue instructor yelled `` Get him!'' before a panic-stricken recruit was forced back into the swimming pool where he died, a classmate testified Saturday. The classmate, Airman Apprentice <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Boos </PERSON>, was unable to identify which instructors were among the four or five who pulled Airman Recruit <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, into the pool March 2 at the <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>. Boos was the lead witness in an investigative hearing to determine whether six sailors should face court-martial in the death of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>. Another one of <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s classmates, Airman Recruit <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkrider </PERSON>, testified that the panic-stricken recruit had shouted `` Leave me alone ... I quit,'' and indicated he was quitting the rescue school. A heart specialist testified that heart failure most likely caused by fear-induced stress apparently killed <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>. But Cmdr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON>, a cardiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said his assessment was only conjecture based on a review of the autopsy report. The doctor said the heart problem, known medically as ventricular fibrillation, also could have been caused by drowning, hyperventilation or, less likely, by gastric juices coughed up by a victim during resuscitation attempts. A third student, Airman Apprentice <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiver </PERSON>, testified he heard the command as `` Get Mirecki!'' Seaman Apprentice <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Riemer </PERSON> said he overheard someone say, `` Maybe we used too much force,'' during a meeting between two instructors and Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, the school's commander, shortly after <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was taken away in an ambulance. <PERSON> Riemer </PERSON>, Shiver, Boos and <PERSON> Harkrider </PERSON> now are taking technical training at the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. Prior to the testimony, Lt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, the lawyer for one of the accused, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, complained that information from an investigation by the Judge Advocate General's office was being withheld on orders of the Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and lawyers for other defendants made a motion that the proceedings be suspended until that information is released. Presiding Cmdr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> D'Alesio </PERSON> rejected the request, saying administrative proceedings are separate from the criminal case and that he lacked authority to release the information. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>, the prosecutor, assured defense lawyers the information would be made available before the conclusion of the hearing, which is expected to last several days. Boos testified that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> panicked during a drill known as `` sharks and daisies.'' The exercise pits instructors, playing the role of panicky drowning victims, against trainees, who then are supposed to drag them underwater to break their hold and rescue them. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was having difficulty and swam to the side of the pool. He was pulled off the poolside, swam back to the side, climbed out and held on to an equipment rack, <PERSON> Boos </PERSON> said. `` He was panicked,'' <PERSON> Boos </PERSON> said. `` He was scared ... He was yelling ... It was obvious he did n't want to be back in the pool.'' <PERSON> Boos </PERSON> said he could n't understand what <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was screaming. The next time he saw <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boos </PERSON> said, the recruit was pulled to the side of the pool by one of the defendants, Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>. A second class member, Petty Officer 3rd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, said at one point he saw Combe trying to calm <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> down and run through the drill with him. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> then successfully accomplished the escape and towed <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, he said. But after that exercise, <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> testified, he saw both <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> and <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> go under and then <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> surface towing <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>. <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> said he did n't actually see <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> being forced back in, but felt <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was clearly panicked and would not possibly have returned voluntarily. Five enlisted instructors are charged with involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery. They are <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, Petty Officers 2nd Class <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON>. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, the school's commanding officer, is charged with dereliction of duty. When the hearing ends, <PERSON> D'Alesio </PERSON> will make a non-binding recommendation to Rear Adm. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, chief of naval air training in <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The admiral can drop the charges, court-martial the defendants or impose a non-judicial punishment. If convicted at court-martial each of the six could be dismissed from the service. The five instructors also face maximum penalties of three years in prison on the manslaughter counts and six months for conspiracy. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON> could be sentenced to a maximum of three months in jail.

 Negotiators for striking scriptwriters and movie and television producers met for about seven hours Saturday and agreed only to return to the bargaining table Sunday, a spokeswoman said. The two chief negotiators for the <ORGANIZATION> Writers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION> met from 1 p.m. until 8 p.m. Saturday at the producers' headquarters, said <ORGANIZATION> WGA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON>. The two sides were scheduled to meet again Sunday in an effort to end the 13-week-old walkout, she said. The substance of the talks was withheld, as were details of a negotiating session on Friday. `` I can only say the discussions are ongoing,'' <PERSON> Rhoden </PERSON> said Saturday night. The writers walked out March 7 in a dispute that centers on payments, called residuals, for reruns of one-hour television shows. Demand for one-hour shows in rerun, or syndication, is declining, and the producers had sought to tie payments to a show's success in reruns. Also at issue in the strike are writers' demands for more say over changes made in scripts during filming and more credit on and off screen for their work. The guild has signed other contracts with about 80 independent producers, but the alliance maintains none of its larger members have signed and that the producers who did defect employ only a tiny fraction of the 3,000 active writers.

 A strong earthquake triggered landslides, shattered windows and caused power blackouts in the lower half of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s south island on Saturday, officials said. The quake measured 6.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, but damage was limited because the quake was centered on the sparsely-populated area of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Te </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anau </LOCATION>, north of the town of <LOCATION> Invercargill </LOCATION>, officials said. There were no immedate reports of injuries. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wellington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that aftershocks could be expected to continue for as long as a month. The Richter scale measures ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. An earthquake of 6.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause severe damage and a 7.0 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage.

 Telephone technicians restored service just after midnight Sunday to the last of 35,000 western suburban customers whose phones were disrupted by a Mother's Day fire, company officials said. `` It went very smoothly, and everything should be back to normal now,'' <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said early Sunday, shortly after the final adjustments were made at the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> switching station. By throwing the switch at midnight, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> hooked up the last set of subscribers in <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> and five other west <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs. The customers would be switched to new state-of-the-art digital equipment at the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> station, which was ravaged by fire May 8. `` Technically, this should be the end of it,'' said <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` We are putting everybody back in service ... but there might be some little glitches that we will have to work out. The switching station equipment connects local and long distance calls. Half the <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> customers were connected to the new equipment at midnight May 26, but the other half continued to suffer impaired phone service, including sporadic dial tones and static on the line. The company promised rebates to customers for the disruptions, but several businessmen upset about their losses have filed lawsuits charging the telephone company was negligent in failing to staff the switching station at the time of the fire.

<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs of detail on deportation case and libel suit,
background on uprising.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday upheld a government decision to deport Arab-American <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an advocate of civil disobedience toward Israeli rule in the occupied territories. The court said it will delay the deportation until next Sunday, apparently to give <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> time to appear in court for a civil libel suit against the Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, responded to the ruling by saying, `` I am not disappointed. I will continue to fight for a Palestinian state wherever I am.'' The decison by the three-judge panel was read in a 10-minute session only hours before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who protested the deportation order, was due to arrive in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to pursue a peace initiative. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> deported May 6, after the Arab-American was arrested the previous day and accused of playing a role in inciting the six-month-old Arab uprising in the occupied territories. The Jerusalem-born <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who also has a home in <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, has denied the charges. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> describes himself as an adherent of the late Indian leader <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghandi </PERSON>'s philosophy of civil disobedience. He has authored a widely-circulated pamphlet called ` Non-Violent Resistance: A Strategy for the Occupied Territories.'' In a statement from jail after he was ordered deported, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said: `` For Prime Minister <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to say that I, a Christian, will be forever prevented from returning to my city of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to pray in my holy places is totally unacceptable.'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> when the city was ruled by neighboring <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. His appeal against the deportation was considered by his lawyers to be a test case for the status of Palestinians under Israeli rule in the city. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> after capturing the sector of the city from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s grounds for deportation was that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> failed to renew a tourist visa that expired last year. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> and <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> contended he did not need a visa and should be allowed permanent residence because he was born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. In issuing the deportation order, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> on May 7th of helping to compile a series of leaflets urging Palestinians to throw stones and firebombs at Israeli targets. According to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures, 201 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising. Three Israelis have also died. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s American-born wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON> responded by telling reporters last month that her husband was committed to non-violence but also to the `` intefadeh,'' which is Arabic for uprising. She said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> supported measures such as merchant strikes and boycotts of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> goods which matched <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s philosophy of civil disobedience. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s Israeli lawyer <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON> won court approval to delay his client's deportation, pending another hearing in a $ 100,000 libel suit. In the suit filed last week, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> challenged Maariv for claiming in an article on May 13 that he dealt in drugs and channeled the proceeds to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>.

 The half-brother of Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and charged with hiring someone to attack a murder witness, police said Sunday. <PERSON> Noah </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, 45, was arrested late Saturday night and charged with being an accessory to a felony, obstruction of justice, intimidating a witness and criminal conspiracy, according to <ORGANIZATION> Greenville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Detective <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, a small businessman in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION> who has also worked in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, is suspected of hiring someone who slashed and stabbed a woman who was a witness to the execution-style murder of a man who had worked for <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` We think he was responsible for the solicitation of the act and took part in the arranging,'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who gave police a home address in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have the same father. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has spoken frequently on the campaign trail of his beginnings, was born out of wedlock to a woman who had an affair with the candidate's father, who was married at the time. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> have had a chaotic relationship over the years, at times working together but also quarreling and staying apart. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> take control of the federally funded <ORGANIZATION> Breadbasket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an arm of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s civil rights group, Operation PUSH, that helped minority firms bid for public contracts. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was quoted as saying in 1987, when <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was reportedly being investigated for allegedly violating federal bankruptcy laws, `` I have no connection with him.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Borosage </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign spokesman, declined to comment early Sunday. A duty officer at the <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was being held Sunday in lieu of $ 100,000 bond, although <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> said prosecutors planned to seek a higher bond. The warrant filed late Saturday charges that <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> `` did advise, counsel, urge encourage or otherwise aid a co-defendant in the commission of a felony, assault and battery with intent to kill ... and later rendered assistance to the co-defendant in absconding the jurisdiction.''

 Rescuers on Sunday found the bodies of eight more miners killed in a powerful coal mine blast, bringing the confirmed death toll to 45 in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s worst mining accident in 26 years. Six men who survived three days in an underground air pocket were rescued Saturday after a microphone lowered into a shaft picked up their voices and tapping sounds. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruehland </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Preussen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elektra </ORGANIZATION>, the company that owns the mine, said rescuers were continuing the search for six miners still missing since the blast Wednesday. Residents of <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION>, 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, were to hold a service later Sunday to remember the victims of the tragedy. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network, surviving miner <PERSON> Ahmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Batkan </PERSON> said he and the five other miners contacted rescuers by radio just hours after the blast, but that the rescuers apparently thought the six were with the search teams. Officials said the survivors were trapped about 500 feet underground in an air pocket away from carbon monoxide estimated at 50 times the level fatal to humans. Officials said about 200 workers were involved in the search in <LOCATION> Borken </LOCATION>, a town of 15,000 people. The Borken explosion is the worst West German mining accident since 299 men died in 1962 at the <LOCATION> Luisenthal </LOCATION> mine in <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> state along the border with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

 A freight car exploded as a train approached a station east of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> capital, killing more than 50 people, injuring hundreds more and throwing cars and trucks into the air like feathers, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The government newspaper said the accident occurred at exactly 9:30 a.m. Saturday and the blast was so powerful it broke windows a quarter-mile away. It said the cause of the explosion was as yet unknown, and gave no hint of what the freight car that exploded might have been carrying. The blast occurred as the train neared the station in <LOCATION> Arzamas </LOCATION>, about 240 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` At its very epicenter were trucks and cars, which were waiting for the train to pass,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They were scattered about as though they were down.'' As a result of the explosion, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said, `` more than 50 people were killed, and hundreds were wounded.'' More than 80 doctors were airlifted by helicopter to the accident site from the regional center of Gorky, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The explosion destroyed nearby homes and businesses, set off small fires in many places, derailed other freight cars and damaged the rails, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. Driven forward by the blast, the locomotive was flipped end over end and landed beside the tracks. Firefighters manning a dozen fire trucks managed to douse the main blaze about a half-hour after the explosion, the newspaper said. A mobile hospital able to care for 230 people was quickly set up near the accident scene, it said. A special government commission was created under the deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON>, to determine the causes of the explosion and deal with the consequences. <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON>'s high position indicated the seriousness of the accident. He told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> local residents instantly offered to help victims of the explosion by donating blood and food. People left homeless by the explosion have been placed in apartments, <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON> said. A special `` operations group,'' military units and the local civil defense are directing relief work, <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON> said. The 14-member government commission includes representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, police, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, the prosecutor's office and other agencies. `` A thorough investigation is being conducted into the causes of the explosion,'' <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON> said. `` I can not yet say anything about the results.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Sunday urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and restore rights to Palestinians. `` Now is the time for further progress toward peace,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> after he arrived for a seven-hour visit to pursue his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace initiative. `` The continued occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the frustration of Palestinian rights is a dead end. To continue it is an illusion,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has put forward a plan for negotiations. No party has the luxury to turn aside a chance to negotiate.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Since anti-occupation unrest broke out in the occupied lands on Dec. 8, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have killed more than 200 Palestinians. Two Israelis have been killed. Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> greeted <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. `` We look upon you as a man with a message, a man who carries a message of peace to all of us,'' he said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said there was a choice `` between the continued arms race, fanatacism, fundamentalism and other manifestations of extremism and the tough decision required to block this trend and to offer the Middle East Arabs and Jews alike a different future.'' Before <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> arrived, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who heads the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, `` I will do all I can to advance the peace process. ... Let's say the peace process dies, then what's the alternative?'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, however, who objects to parts of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s plan, told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Saturday he does not expect a breakthrough. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who heads the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, objects to trading land for peace. He also opposes a proposed international peace conference in which Western countries would mediate a settlement of the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. On Sunday, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said the premier `` greatly welcomes the visit, the efforts Mr. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is making to advance the peace process.'' <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> will will raise <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s concern about the use of chemical weapons by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states and their newly-purchased medium-range missiles. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> -RRB- feels that the whole free world should raise its voice against the use of these weapons'' by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is also expected to report to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit last week and the talks he held in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> he was encouraged by changes he said he has detected in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s approach to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> during the 1967 war, but gradually has resumed contacts over the last two years.

 <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> on Sunday denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for saying that groups supported by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> were suspected in recent attacks against Americans and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities around the world. The official <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said the allegations were made to undermine <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, hinder <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity and force <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to retreat from its `` support of the massive popular revolution in occupied Palestine.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Friday that groups that have received support from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> were the `` prime suspects'' in recent attacks against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and western European interests in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. She did not accuse <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> directly but said suspicion of its continued support of terrorism was accompanied by `` concrete evidence.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> referred to the seizure last November in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> of a shipment of <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> weapons allegedly intended for the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. She also cited reports that suspected Libyan agents were arrested carrying bomb-making materials in <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> in February. <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said the statements affirm again the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's `` reliance on the language of threat in international dealings. `` We interpret this new threat by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> as a start of aggression ... without any justification but hatred and the spirit of domination and racism,'' it said. For years, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has been one of a few nations identified by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> as sponsors of terrorist groups. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has accused <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> of fomenting terrorism. In April 1986, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes attacked his personal living quarters in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. He was not hit.

<HEAD>Sixteen Soldiers Killed In Rebel Ambush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BACOLOD, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Communist rebels ambushed a platoon of soldiers trying to retrieve a hijacked truck Sunday, killing 16 and wounding eight in one of the bloodiest rebel attacks this year, officials said. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the troops managed to fight back and killed an undetermined number of rebels during the hour-long battle on an isolated mountain road. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> charged that unidentified European governments were indirectly financing communist rebels. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> made the accusation on the third day of a conference among representatives of 13 Asian, European and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries that have won their freedom from dictators. A sketchy military report said 24 soldiers and militiamen were traveling on foot when they came under fire from an unknown number of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas outside <LOCATION> Silay </LOCATION> city, 300 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and about 25 miles from <LOCATION> Bacalod </LOCATION>. The rebels fled when more troops backed by helicopter gunships and armored personnel carriers arrived, the report said. Residents of nearby villages evacuated their homes as troops continued to hunt the rebels after the battle, which began at 2 p.m., the officials said. Local radio reports said the ambushed soldiers were on their way to retrieve a truck loaded with fertilizer that rebels abandoned after hijacking it Saturday night. The truck belonged to one of the biggest sugar producing companies on <LOCATION> Negros </LOCATION> island. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is one of 12 Marxist groups that have been waging a 19-year insurgency in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is the umbrella organization for the groups. The Philippine military estimates that the front received $ 15 million in aid last year from groups in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said foreign aid to the rebels came from non-governmental organizations but noted that such groups in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are subsidized by some governments. `` This, of course, is practically an official flow of money, and our armed forces and intelligence agencies tell us that this takes place regularly in a systematic manner,'' <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON> said. He said he has filed formal protests with the European governments concerned but did not identify any of them. He said he has not raised the matter with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, Japanese, Australian and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> governments but did not say why. Earlier, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s representative in the conference denied claims by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was among its supporters. `` We have nothing in common with insurgents and, therefore, we deplore such cheap and shameless lies,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Lianis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Other countries attending the conference were <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and were represented as observers.

 <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Riha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was worth between $ 6 million and $ 10 million before he was 45, had a successful company, owned property in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, drove expensive cars and was married with two children. That life collapsed in less than two years after he began smoking cocaine. He recently pleaded guilty to two cocaine trafficking charges and one possession charge, and was sentenced to 15 years on each. A hearing is scheduled June 17 to determine how much of the sentence must be served behind bars. He also awaits trial on a fourth charge. During a recent series of interviews at the <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jail </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Riha </PERSON>, 45, told the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Herald </ORGANIZATION> about his downfall. `` That pipe, that person, that thing in my hand, it was very much alive; it was a living thing to me,'' <PERSON> Riha </PERSON> said. `` I talked to it, and it answered me. It came back with positive-plus reactions and answers and made me work everything out in my mind. It lies all the time.'' His personal net worth is down to $ 100,000 by some estimates. The company he founded in <LOCATION> Pelham </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welding </ORGANIZATION>, which grossed about $ 6 million a year and employed 25 people, is bankrupt. He says he had never used any kind of drug until one day in October 1986 when he walked into the home of a friend and walked out about 12 hours later, hooked on cocaine. `` I said, ` What is this? There is no such thing on earth that could do that to me, that could take control of me,'' <PERSON> Riha </PERSON> said. `` I took the pipe and smoked it so nonchalantly that first time.'' The drug relaxed him. `` All my worries disappeared,'' he said. He had plenty of money and plenty of time, and gave himself over to binge after binge. `` It is not unusual for a person to lose everything they have,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, clinical director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>. `` The unusual situation here is that this individual had so much to lose.'' The drug interfered with <PERSON> Riha </PERSON>'s closest interests. A horse-racing fan from his childhood in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, he was one of the first to invest in the new <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, purchasing 1,000 shares of stock and 51 limited partnerships. He signed up his company to rent of one of the prestigious boxes at $ 25,000 a year. But when the horse track opened March 3, 1987, `` it took everything I could muster to get there,'' he said. `` I almost did n't make it through the evening And I found myself leaving to go to my car between the races to hit the pipe.'' He fulfilled another lifelong dream by investing about $ 400,000 to put together a dragster and crew, but when the car was ready to race in January 1987, it held no interest and <PERSON> Riha </PERSON> only made it to a few races. `` It's amazing how the drug can take your interest in everything away, from hobbies to your business, sex, love, everything, and replace it with itself,'' said <PERSON> Riha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Riha </PERSON> was arrested on drug charges twice but returned to cocaine use late last year after a month in a rehabilitation program. On Christmas Day last year, <PERSON> Riha </PERSON> said, `` I sat there looking at bankruptcy papers, the suit my father filed against me for the $ 400,000 I had borrowed from him over the years, divorce papers that never went through and the criminal charges. ` Well, merry Christmas, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>,' I said. But at least I had my pipe there, too.'' Later he was arrested for allegedly giving cocaine to a minor, the 17-year-old daughter of his mistress. He said she took it from him. She testified she was working for the police and that he gave her cocaine when she asked for it. `` I do n't think I was meant to go sit in prison,'' <PERSON> Riha </PERSON> said. `` I did n't go through all this to end this way.''

 Palestinian merchants struggling for financial survival in the occupied lands face threats from both sides in the Arab uprising _ a fact driven home during Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit. Underground leaders of the uprising threaten to burn Arab stores if they do n't observe general strikes, such as the three-day work stoppage ordered to protest <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Sunday. At the same time, the Israeli government uses taxes as one of its major weapons for fighting the uprising. `` If I open, they will burn it,'' said grocer <PERSON> Sahli </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagari </PERSON>, 43, standing outside his shop in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sagari </PERSON> already has tasted the other side of the equation. In May, he and 13 other merchants on the Street of the Prophets opened at the specific hours ordered by uprising leaders. They were shut down by Israeli police and charged with violating laws that could mean two years in prison. They now await trial. Merchants say the government drive to enforce tax payments _ ordered boycotted by uprising leaders _ has disrupted some businesses and forced others to close. `` There's no way any company can clear anything unless all taxes are paid,'' said <PERSON> Serop </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohannessian </PERSON>, general manager of a paper factory in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. A tax receipt must be shown for a marriage license or a birth certificate. Merchants say they need to produce such receipts for everything from export and import licenses to trucks and machinery. <PERSON> Tanus </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitah </PERSON> has shut his <ORGANIZATION> Jordan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plastics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, which employed about 300 workers. He complained he was caught between the Palestinian strikes, which cut his production, and the government's tax demands. `` I am losing my customers because I'm not producing all their needs,'' he said. `` As for the taxes, I have to pay them whether we are working full-time or not. If I do n't pay, I will be arrested. The best solution is to close the factory.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials say some Arab merchants have begged the army to force shops to open to relieve merchants of the threat of revenge from young men behind the uprising or the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. But most merchants say they back the uprising's goal of ending the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The merchants also do n't want to lose customers who are making sacrifices for the uprising. <LOCATION> Ohannessian </LOCATION>, the paper products man, said he has closed his entire plastic diaper line, laying off about 70 of his 150 workers, because of another problem. While Israelis are stopping his trucks from reaching the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> during the uprising, Israeli manufacturers are shipping paper diapers to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> under Arab-sounding product names, he said. `` What has happened is we're completely encircled,'' he said. `` They -LRB- Israeli competitors -RRB- can extend credit to stores at a time when I have to ask for payment right away.'' In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, the owner of a food products factory who gave his name only as <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> said merchants trying to bring goods into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also run into tax collectors at army checkpoints. `` They stop any truck without a tax receipt. Then they confiscate the product and the truck,'' he said. He said <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>'s merchants fear youths who have burned cars and shops after owners were accused of breaking the strike. In the hillside Haret al-Sheikh section of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a group of young men explained that it was rarely necessary to burn anything to persuade people to strike. `` First we send them a threatening letter,'' said one of the seven or eight present. `` If that does n't work, we throw a ` Molotov' at the wall around their house, then set a tire on fire outside The fourth step is to burn shops and cars.'' Some merchants find a way around orders in the underground uprising's leaflets, such as the one that requires Palestinian businesses to open only in the mornings. <PERSON> Jamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON>, 26, keeps his east Jerusalem supermarket shuttered each afternoon, but cut a hole in the wall from his adjacent house so customers can enter the store unnoticed. But even <PERSON> Tawil </PERSON> closes up the hole during general strikes. `` I do n't want to lose the business,'' he said.

<BYLINE>Is the Gun Lobby Losing Its Clout?

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> political chief <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> makes frequent visits to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, but his meeting with Democratic Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> on May 27 was anything but routine. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, long considered one of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s most influential lobbying organizations, never apologizes for the harsh attacks it makes on lawmakers opposing its positions. But here was <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> _ according to <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>'s recollection _ admitting the group had gone too far in attacking a senator who has been a longtime supporter of gun owners. `` I think their influence has deteriorated some,'' said <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>. And the conservative Nebraskan's view is shared by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s traditional opponents, like <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s more recent antagonists, the nation's major law enforcement organizations. <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, who parted with the organization over a bill to ban plastic guns that could escape detection at airport metal detectors, said that what he saw as <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>'s apologetic tone reinforced his conclusion. But <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, denies his comments to <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> amounted to an apology, and rejects any view that the pro-gun group has lost a step. `` Our base is as good as gold,'' <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> says. `` We're going to be in good shape as long as there are 70 million Americans who own guns and 25 million who hunt. There are 70 senators and 260 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who have never voted against us.'' But <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> described a different mood: `` They indicated to me they had fallen down badly in communications. They said they were going to do everything they could to remedy that. They said they may have over-reacted in the type of advertising and letter-writing to my constituents.'' While <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> believes the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> has lost influence by attacking its friends, the group's political opponents cite other reasons for their view. Among them: _ The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s switch from opposition to support of a bill to ban undetectable plastic guns, legislation that is a top priority of gun control and police groups and is sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> nemesis Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION> The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> changed its mind after police groups successfully lobbied Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> to support their version of the measure. <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> says the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> switched only after new language made clear the bill would ban only still non-existent plastic handguns, not existing metal pistols. `` A victory for the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> says. _ A stunning gun control triumph in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, where Gov <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON>, in a ceremony with some 200 police officers, signed a bill May 27 to ban the sale of cheap handguns known as Saturday Night Specials. <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s supporters have begun an effort, successful in its early stages, to place a repeal referendum on the ballot. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat of an NRA-backed constitutional amendment proposal to clarify the right to keep and bear arms Also, the failure of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> to win passage of legislation that would have prohibited local governments from passing any gun control law stricter than state law. <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> contends that state legislatures passed 18 NRA-backed bills in 1986, 24 last year and 13 so far this year. `` There's only one gun control bill that's gone through, and that's in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>,'' he says. `` It was our agenda being discussed in state legislatures, not the other side's.'' _ In the 1986 congressional elections, not a single incumbent targeted for defeat by the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> lost his or her seat <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>: `` It's very tough to defeat incumbents in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> these days. Most members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who vote for gun control are in safe districts and nobody's going to beat them. There are few competitive districts left where the gun issue is the -LRB- major -RRB- issue.'' _ In recent congressional battles and numerous state gun control fights, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> and the organized police groups have clashed bitterly This has given state lawmakers and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a political escape hatch, allowing them to oppose the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> by supporting their local police. `` I do n't see their relationship with police as ever being very good again,'' says <PERSON> Jerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON> says he held meetings recently with `` three or four'' members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, `` people who we felt were confused'' over the early version of the plastic gun bill. `` They're still friends of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> LaPierre </PERSON>'s view of his meeting with <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>: `` I view it as informational. If information is fence-mending, and fence-mending is information, I guess you could interchange them.'' <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> says of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, `` They are by no means out of the picture, but there are signs their stranglehold on this administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is starting to loosen a bit. There's a growing recognition in law enforcement the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> is an organization out of control. But politically, they're a savvy organization. They make sure they're never in a position of having to admit defeat.'' N.T. `` Pete'' <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, says the entry of law enforcement groups into the fray has been crucial. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> used to call us bleeding-heart communists, soft on criminals,'' <PERSON> Shields </PERSON> says. `` Now, whole law enforcement community _ the guys on the firing line on the street _ is behind it -LRB- the fight to control guns -RRB-. It's not credible to think of those people as bleeding-heart, liberal communists.''

 Republican <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidates, increasingly concerned about political fallout from <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s legal problems, are beginning to call on the attorney general to leave President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Cabinet. At least four <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates have urged <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to resign and others have hinted they would like to see him go. Leading Republicans such as Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and White House staff chief <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> have conceded <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s troubles could severely damage <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> prospects this election year. But the attorney general has insisted he has done nothing wrong and will remain in office until he can `` set the record straight.'' Independent Counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is expected to issue his report this month on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s conduct. Sources familiar with the probe said the report would not recommend an indictment but would raise questions about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethical conduct. In recent interviews <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has refused to say when he might leave office, but has ruled out a departure before his name is cleared `` because people would say there was something wrong.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s strongest defender in the administration is <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who has said that `` only a complete change of -LRB- <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s -RRB- character'' would prompt him to ask his old friend to resign. However, that view is not shared by many Republicans involved in tough election campaigns. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he met early last month with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, and the attorney general assured him he would do nothing to jeopardize the vice president's presidential campaign. In a recent interview, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has `` been made aware by the polls and by a lot of public comment that there is the danger that this matter, if it stays exactly the way it is, could not only adversely affect me, but others as well.'' During a recent television interview, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> acknowledge <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s discomfort `` It's a difficult situation,'' he said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show, `` Meet the Press.'' `` It's an unfortunate situation. It's one that obviously troubles the vice president. But in the final analysis, the only person who can make a judgment on this is the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and the president has expressed his continued confidence in the attorney general.'' <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, battling to oust Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, told a college commencement audience recently: `` I believe <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should step down as our nation's leading law enforcement officer.'' Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> challenger trying to unseat Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, recently declared that `` for the good of the country, the president, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> should resign.'' `` If Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> ever had any use to the administration, it has long since passed ... he ought to go,'' said <PERSON> Slade </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator, trying to capture the seat being vacated by Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash. A fourth GOP <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who is running against Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, recently wrote <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to say, `` I urge you to step aside and resign as attorney general to enhance the credibility of that office as well as the credibility of the presidency. Several Republican senators have stopped barely short of outright calls for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to resign. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, fighting a challenge from Democratic former Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, recently said he did not think <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was a factor in his race. But then he added, `` I'm not going to be writing any letters saying please stay.'' Typical of one approach was that of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, R-R. When asked about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, the senator, who is up for re-election, said he believes it is up to the president to decide but then adds that he thinks <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> might be better served by someone else. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., has said he expected <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> to issue `` a very serious and condemnatory'' report In that case, he said, if <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> did n't resign, the report would go to the Office of Professional Responsibility, which the senator described as `` a very tough office.'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said he anticipated that office `` would recommend that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> either resign or be fired by the president.''

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An environmental leader and a Western politician have taken up the cause of the wolf, calling for its return to the wilds of the nation's first national park. They added their voices Saturday to that of the head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, who said that the howl of the wolf is `` the call, the music, of the West.'' Lined up in opposition are the majority of cattlemen and sheepmen in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> backed by <PERSON> Wymoning </PERSON>'s two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators and one representative. Speaking at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Utah </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, president of the Defenders of Wildlife, urged national support for restoration of the wolf to Yellowstone National Park. The coalition, formed in 1983, consists of about 50 national, regional and local organizations that monitor management of the 2.5 million-acre park. Nearly all of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s wolf population was wiped out earlier this century by ranchers, farmers and bounty hunters. There have been a few sightings of lone wolves in a few Western states. A pack of wolves migrated across the Canadian border into <ORGANIZATION> Glacier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> two years ago, but left this year to go back into <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Efforts to revive the wolf population in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> have resulted in about 1,200 wolves there. Efforts to restart the red wolf population in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and Mexican wolf colonies in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> also are under way. Noting that the reintroduction of the gray wolf into <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> is endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said: `` I am always offended when we politicians substitute our own value judgments for those of professional land managers. `` There is a theory among the <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> congressional delegations that they own Yellowstone,'' said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said he introduced a bill in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after discovering in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> park last fall that `` the wolf recovery program had been completely sidetracked by political interference.'' The bill would order the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to implement the Rocky Mountain Wolf Recovery Plan drawn up by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It would re-establish wolves in the entire northern <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region, including <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was clear to me when I introduced the bill that I could not pass it,'' said <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, `` but I hoped to expose the wolf to daylight. There is no predation problem with wolves. It is psychological _ the hatred of wolves.'' <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, whose 80,000-member organization has reintroduction of wolves into <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> as a top priority, said, `` All Americans have a right to influence the course of events in Yellowstone National Park.'' <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said restoring the wolves has `` enormous symbolic importance as well as ecological importance. ... -LRB- It -RRB- will be viewed as one of the major conservation accomplishments of the 1990s.'' <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mott </PERSON> said Friday in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he believes the reintroduction is inevitable. `` When that happens, people may never see a wolf,'' said <PERSON> Mott </PERSON>, `` but they will hear them howl. That is the call, the music, of the West. That quality is as important as a natural presence or a structure -LRB- within a park -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> urged the 300 people attending Saturday's meeting to rally support to force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to hold hearings on the wolf reintroduction plan <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said the next step would be an environmental impact statement on the proposal. He said a requested $ 200,000 federal appropriation is in danger of failing to get through the budget review process.

 Three boxcars packed with 120 tons of explosives blew up near a train station, killing 68 people, injuring 230 others and throwing cars into the air like feathers, the official media reported Sunday. The blast Saturday in <LOCATION> Arzamas </LOCATION>, 240 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, carved a crater 80 feet deep and 175 feet wide and destroyed or damaged more than 400 buildings, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The reports, some of the most detailed Soviet accounts ever filed so soon after an accident, said some of the injuries were serious. They said the cause of the explosion was not known. `` Hospital personnel are doing their best to save the life of every person,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. `` Despite the wide scope of the tragedy, the situation in the city remains calm.'' More than 80 doctors were flown to <ORGANIZATION> Arzamas </ORGANIZATION>, an industrial center of more than 90,000 people. Nearby residents rushed to offer blood and food for the survivors, the media said. The reports indicated that more deaths could result from the accident, the most deadly on Soviet railways this year. They said eight children were among the dead. The area was evacuated, but the local population was quickly reassured that tests showed an `` absence of hazardous components'' in the atmosphere, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The three boxcars carried industrial explosives intended for geologists, mineworkers and builders, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The diesel locomotive pulling the cars flipped over in the blast, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. Cars and trucks halted near the track, waiting for the train to pass, `` were scattered about as though they were -LRB- goose -RRB- down,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The explosion set off small fires, derailed other freight cars and damaged the track, the newspaper said. The fires were extinguished within a half hour, it said. Transport and municipal services also were damaged. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 600 families were left homeless but would get new apartments and compensation for damages. It was the most serious train accident reported since August 1987, when Soviet media said scores of people were killed after a freight train collided with a passenger train in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. It did n't say how many people died. Accidents were never reported in such detail before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power in March 1985, but media stories of incidents have become more common and specific, especially since the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear accident in April 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said a special government commission launched an investigation into Saturday's accident. `` We are taking measures to help all those who suffered from the accident,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON>, head of the investigating commission, as saying. The newspaper said military units and local civil defense workers were directing the relief efforts. A mobile hospital unit was set up near the accident scene, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. Besides <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, the 14-member inquiry commission includes representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, police, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, the prosecutor's office and other agencies `` A thorough investigation is being conducted into the causes of the explosion,'' <PERSON> Vedernikov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` I can not yet say anything about the results.''

<TEXT>
 A 34-year-old Australian woman Sunday became the first woman to sail solo nonstop around the world when she navigated triumphantly into <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> harbor after a 189-day voyage. More than 10,000 people greeted <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cottee </PERSON> at the harbor. She jumped out of the 36-foot sloop <PERSON> Blackmore </PERSON>'s First Lady and onto the dock for an emotional reunion with friends and family. Hundreds of small boats dotted the harbor to welcome her home from a trip she undertook to raise money for Australian children's charities Ms. <PERSON> Cottee </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> shipbuilder, told reporters that during the 23,000-mile easterly journey, `` I experienced real fear for the first time ever at sea.'' She said the worst seas came two days before she rounded <PERSON> Cape </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> at the southern tip of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Jan. 20. `` It was in mountainous seas breaking in huge waves _ just indescribable,'' she said. `` I thought the boat would roll right over and go down.'' But she said she enjoyed the experience. `` Who would n't be happy doing something they love for six uninterrupted months?'' she said. `` It was a personal challenge. ... I learned that I've got more endurance and determination than I ever thought I had.'' After leaving <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> harbor last Nov. 29, Ms. <PERSON> Cottee </PERSON> had no physical contact with other boats or people. She carried all the dried and canned food she needed for the trip. Her journey also was the fastest sailing trip around the globe by a woman. Ms. <PERSON> Cottee </PERSON> said she had not been lonely because she was regularly in radio contact with family members and the Australian media. `` With the state of modern communications equipment, I made a lot of friends along the way,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Cottee </PERSON> said she also had time to give up smoking, read books and listen to music. Among those at the harbor to meet Ms. <PERSON> Cottee </PERSON> were <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON>, premier of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Hazel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>, wife of Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auctioneers racked up nearly $ 500,000 in sales Sunday at their first auction in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and organizers said the profits would go to renovate half a mile of the Great Wall. `` It's super,'' said <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, auctioneer and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, after 73 Chinese and Western works of modern art and rare objects brought in a total of 1.76 million yuan, or about $ 475,850 After auction costs of about $ 100,000 are paid, half the remaining money is to go toward renovating the crumbling Great Wall and half toward saving the Italian city of <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, which is sinking beneath the waters of the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Danial </PERSON> <PERSON> Vial </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Parisian </LOCATION> public relations agent who organized the auction as part of four days of events to benefit the Great Wall and <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION>, said enough money was raised to rebuild a kilometer of the wall. Parts of the wall were built more than 2,200 years ago, and many sections have been reduced by time and warfare to piles of stone. Some bids were made by telephone from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, but most of the purchasers were among more than 200 wealthy foreigners who paid $ 4,300 each to attend the benefit. The auction was held in the former imperial palace in a 15th-century hall where Chinese emperors once worshipped their ancestors. Several said their purchases would be souvenirs of the unusual benefit, which included a caviar luncheon on the Great Wall, boating at an imperial palace and a gala performance by opera and ballet stars at the Great Hall of the People. The painting that had been expected to bring the highest price _ `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Proverb'' by American artist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauschenberg </PERSON> _ went for only $ 40,387, half its pre-sale estimate. A painted pottery jug by <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON> sold for $ 14,808, well below its pre-sale estimated value. The cheapest item was a Sevres porcelain cup that went for 500 yuan, or $ 135, about half the annual salary of the average Chinese factory worker.

<HEAD>Dukakis May Find Himself Depicted As Leftist on Defense Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could find himself depicted as far to the left on critical questions of defense and military strength in the fall race for the White House. His opposition to many weapons systems already has drawn fire both from Republicans and within his own party. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, rejecting characterizations of him as naive and reluctant in the use of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> power, says he wants to enhance <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conventional forces while keeping defense spending stable and wants to rely on the cooperation of allies in cases of potential international threats. The likely Democratic presidential nominee does not shrink from a foreign policy debate with the expected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He already has begun attacking him on the administration's Iran-Contra affair and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy But while nationwide surveys give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> an edge over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the one area in which voters continue to place more confidence in the Republicans than the Democrats is military strength and dealing with the Soviets. `` It's clearly an issue that's there to be exploited,'' said <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON>, a political analyst at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think this is potentially the soft underbelly of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> is issues director for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a group of defense-minded Democrats led by <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' attitude on foreign affairs questions gives some Democrats concern about <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' ability to project resolve and a willingness to intervene unilaterally, if necessary. `` His strong stand on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and conventional forces makes him obviously not a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, not an isolationist,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` But on Third World, regional conflicts, and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he tends to strike a very legalistic, moralistic posture that raises questions about what is the best way to protect our national interests and support the spread of democracy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has portrayed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' views on defense as akin to those of <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, the Democrats' 1972 peace candidate who lost in a landslide. `` Even <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> supported -LRB- weapons -RRB- systems that Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` The governor's views are naive at best, and if implemented would be dangerous to the defense of this country. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his campaign parry the issue back at the vice president. `` We feel strongly,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> communications director <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>, `` that the real vulnerabilities on foreign policy are on the Republican side. They've got to explain away -LRB- <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, Iran-Contra, and a failed and unpopular policy in Central America.'' <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' only remaining Democratic rival, has accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of avoiding specifics on many issues. But it is on defense systems where the two may be closest, with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also opposing major new weapons systems and calling for cuts in the Star Wars nuclear defense program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a meeting on defense issues last fall with a group of Democratic defense specialists, including veterans of past administrations and think-tank experts. One participant, speaking only on condition he not be named, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the experts did n't seem to connect. `` There was certainly a kind of ships passing in the night feature to it, to put it mildly,'' this Democratic defense specialist said. He said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' remarks generated concern about an `` idealistic view of rule of law in foreign policy _ that although the personal styles and attitudes and demeanor are very different, that he's really very similar to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> I think that's what people are worried about.'' Not everyone who attended the meeting felt that way. Some have come to be <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign advisers. `` He seemed to be open minded, to be willing to listen, but not to be terribly familiar with the issues,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Komer </PERSON>, a former undersecretary of defense who is now a consultant at the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has focused on beefing up the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> conventional military forces _ taking a page from the book of <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wants to enhance air and sea support, and supplies such as ammunition, for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, said <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of international relations and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' senior foreign policy adviser. He believes `` some targeted new investments are necessary,'' but will not estimate their price, she said. He does not call for cuts in overall defense spending but would keep the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget `` stable'' for several years, financing his projects from cuts in Star Wars and other systems, she said. However, speaking to senior citizens in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in mid-May, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suggested services for the elderly could be paid for from military cutbacks. `` Are we going to spend $ 6 billion on <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> and MX missiles on railroad cars, or are we going to build affordable housing for families of low and moderate income and the elderly?'' he asked. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> opposes both the MX and Midgetman missile systems and is against plans to add two more aircraft carriers and the support ships that go with them. Although it is too late to stop the B-1 bomber program, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would not favor buying more B-1s if elected, said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, issues director for the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` His point is we ca n't buy everything in the defense candy store,'' <PERSON> Edley </PERSON> said, `` that we have to make choices that really do advance our essential security needs. And he would emphasize our conventional strength.'' Ultimately, individual weapons systems may prove less important in shaping voters' judgments than feelings about the candidates' resolve and strength `` I think there's some real unease out there about where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would draw the line in the dust,'' <PERSON> Ornstein </PERSON> said. In both the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cites the need for agreement among other nations to stop hostilities. `` There's a feeling Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> places too great a store in the possibility of solving all conflicts through negotiated settlement,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` He needs to reassure people that although a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration would be very vigorous and dogged in its exploration of diplomatic avenues for achieving our national interests, in the final analysis he's willing to act decisively to protect our crucial interests.''

<TEXT>
 Real estate agent <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was burning up the phone lines again Sunday and <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Hector </PERSON>, expecting her third child any minute, felt calmer knowing she could reach out and touch someone in an emergency. Nearly a month after a May 8 fire damaged a switching station and left 35,000 customers in six western <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburbs without service for varying lengths of time, the Great Phone Outage came to a quiet end. At 12:01 a.m. Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> officials transferred the last 18,000 customers from the damaged, jury-rigged switch to a new, state-of-the-art digital unit. With as many as 250 employees often working around-the-clock, the company compressed what is normally a 50-week job into less than four weeks. `` It was a very good cutover, very uneventful,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` Thank goodness. Any more problems and I might have hit the roof,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON>, whose exchange was among the last of six to be transferred by <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>. `` Being without a reliable phone is like being without running water,'' she said. `` You never realize how important it is until it's gone.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> said she had spent much of the month in her car, running errands she normally would have taken care of by telephone. `` I could n't reach the other mothers in my children's pre-school classes for car pooling. I could n't call to make doctor's appointments for myself and then my own kids got sick,'' she said `` I just started showing up at the -LRB- doctors' -RRB- offices instead of making appointments. `` And then when I was home, I was anxious because I'm so far along -LRB- with the pregnancy -RRB-. Even so,'' she added, `` I think I'm going to miss some of those times when the phones were n't ringing off the hook. Not Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. `` The phone is my lifeline,'' she said from her downtown <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION> office. `` When it went down, so did my livelihood. There's only so much paperwork to catch up on, and that's how I justified the first couple of days without the phone. `` Then I went knocking on doors, driving around and leaving notes. But talk about inefficiencies. It was like a different country just a few miles from here where people's phones were working. `` I'd come over to show their house, and they'd tell me ` You'll have to come back later, we did n't have a chance to clean Why did n't you call us?' And I'd say, ` No phones.' And they'd look at me funny.'' Since the Mother's Day fire, phone service had been sporadic at best for Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> and other Bell customers. About half were hooked up to the new system on May 26. With the remainder hooked up Sunday, the utility said things should be back to normal. `` Technically, this should be the end of it ... but there might be some little glitches that we will have to work out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Illinois </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> promised rebates, several businesses were angry enough to file lawsuits charging the utility was negligent in failing to staff the switching station, which houses computerized equipment to connect local and long-distance calls. Firefighters reached the scene 82 minutes after an alarm registered at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> monitoring station And Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> filed a complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> seeking to have <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> pick up the tab for financial losses. But Sunday, at least, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> was savoring its accomplishments in returning the area to full service. `` We still have a lot of work to do, but it wo n't be the kind of feverish work we've been doing,'' said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. `` It was an extraordinary effort by all the people involved.''

 About 80 Soviets shouted `` Freedom, freedom!'' and carried banners through downtown <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Sunday in an unprecedented march to demand the release of political prisoners. About 50 police officers courteously stopped the protesters from advancing to Red Square but allowed them to gather across from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Soviet, the white-columned headquarters of city government. The afternoon march along <ORGANIZATION> Gorky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>, a major thoroughfare that leads to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, was the first in the Soviet capital in memory. Participants credited <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign of `` glasnost,'' or openness on selected topics. `` This protest shows how our political freedoms are widening. Today we are making history,'' declared <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubko </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a fledgling opposition group. Sweating in the sun, the demonstrators gathered near a statue of <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolgoruky </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> prince who founded <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and shouted in unison: `` Freedom, freedom for political prisoners!'' It was the first time that chanting protesters carrying banners marched along a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> street without police making obvious moves to disperse them. In recent months, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> police have allowed some demonstrations to proceed, but they sometimes seized banners and detained participants. In December, police manhandled a dozen young people who gathered outside army headquarters to protest the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> military role in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Sunday's protest sparked reactions ranging from anger to bewilderment from Soviets strolling down <ORGANIZATION> Gorky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION>, one of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s most fashionable shopping avenues. `` Are they making a movie?'' asked <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuchov </PERSON>, 12. A flushed woman shouted at the marchers: `` This is slander! Do n't you see that? The protesters started at 3 p.m. at the base of the monument to 19th century Russian poet <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Pushkin </PERSON>. Hundreds of Soviets looked on. Different groups called for freedom for Armenian nationalist Paruyr Ayrikyan; for leaders of Crimean Tatars who want permission for Tatars to resettle in their <LOCATION> Crimean </LOCATION> homeland; and for political prisoners in the country as a whole. `` We estimate that there are 300 to 400 of them,'' said <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzin </PERSON>, 35, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>'s Central Coordinating Council. `` Not all of them are imprisoned under political counts, but some have been falsely accused and convicted of committing common crimes.'' A young man climbed a lamppost by the bronze statue of <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> to lead the protesters in a chant calling for Ayrikyan's release. Demonstrators then marched down the sidewalk on <LOCATION> Gorky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, past the Central Hotel and vendors selling apple juice and flowers, on their way to Red Square and the Kremlin. Police on the sidewalk across from the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Soviet blocked them after they marched about 500 yards. The protesters then gathered at the <PERSON> Dolgoruky </PERSON> monument. Uniformed police appeared to treat the protesters politely. `` Please stand over there with your banners,'' one lieutenant told a protester after touching him on the shoulder. At 4 p.m., the protesters turned around and returned to <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. A group of Armenians then staged another rally outside the headquarters of the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, 39, was arrested by the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> secret police in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s capital, on March 25. He is the founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Self-Determination </ORGANIZATION>, an Armenian nationalist group. His wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON>, 35, said that <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, who has served 17 years in prison, labor camp and internal exile for his political activities, was being held in a KGB isolation cell while charges against him were investigated. On March 19, <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference that more than 70 people had died in anti-Armenian racial riots in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> on Feb. 28. The Soviet government said 32 people were killed, and Mrs. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON> said her husband had been accused of slandering the Soviet state. The riots grew out of ethnic tensions between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. Armenians have demanded that an Armenian-dominated area of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> be annexed to their republic. Mrs. <PERSON> Ayrikyan </PERSON>, her eyes red from crying, said there were reports her husband had a heart attack while in jail, but she said officials denied her any information about his health. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> accused the groups of staging a `` concert'' for Western reporters in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to cover the 1,000 th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orthodox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> and described <PERSON> Akrikyan </PERSON> as `` a dissident who has declared against the policy of the Soviet state more than once. `` The Criminal Code of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> has no such notion as a political prisoner,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It accused `` extremist-minded'' Crimean Tatars of calling for the release of <PERSON> Sinaver </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadyrov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rishat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ablayev </PERSON> and said they were serving time `` for criminal offenses that have nothing to do with human rights.'' The Tatars, deported by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> as alleged wartime collaborators with the Germans, have been petitioning for years for the right to return to their Crimean homeland.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, driving toward the final primaries and a Democratic delegate majority, said Sunday he had no objections to rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s continued campaigning up to the convention and expects <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to work for the ticket in the fall. `` It's not harmful at all,'' the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s reported intention to continue his campaign past the primary season. `` He's a very strong person who's done an extraordinary job of winning votes and winning support. `` I hope and believe we're going to have a good relationship. We have in the past,'' he said. `` ... I suspect he's going to be out there campaigning hard for the Democratic ticket this fall.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> toward that big state's primary on Tuesday that ends the delegate-selection season, has indicated he intends to keep up a campaign schedule even after the final primary and up to the Democratic Natioal Convention, pressing his issues and seeking support from delegates already chosen <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> holds a commanding lead in delegates, however, with more than 1,800 delegates toward the 2,081 needed to nominate. His campaign aides are confident that he will gain the remaining delegates he needs to assure his nomination by Tuesday's primaris in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, and hope to declare a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> majority has been secured. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> a second day on Sunday before flying to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the afternoon for a final round of campaigning in the state, where he will await the returns Tuesday night. He planned a late rally at a Greek Orthodox church in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Sunday evening, and stops in several <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> cities on Monday. He flew back home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> late Saturday to see his wife <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, who is recovering from delicate surgery on her spine to repair two herniated cervical discs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said she is bothered by pain in her hip, where they removed bone for grafting, and was walking with the support of a walker. He was asked about <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remarks at a news conference in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> after addressing a Sunday morning crowd of about 300 people. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stood on rocks with the city's <LOCATION> Passaic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> waterfalls crashing behind him. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that while he expected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s support, `` that does n't mean that he ca n't advocate for those causes and those things he believes in.'' `` I'll be doing the same. We'll all be doing the same. But I do n't see any deep divisions in the party at all. We're going to be united as never before.'' Appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> suggested <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should be offered the vice presidential nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s remarks, noted that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself has said the nominee should have the choice of selecting a running mate. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is n't thinking about the vice presidency until the 7th of June,'' <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said. `` In terms of Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he is n't ruling anyone in or anyone out.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself said of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s remark: `` That's his point of view.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later addressed about 500 people at an outdoor rally in <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>, a leafy suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and attended a neighborhood festival in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for government investment to revitalize the nation's cities, citing redevelopment projects he said were discontinued in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION> under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and the example of the economic rebirth of <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, in his state. `` That did not happen by accident,'' he said. `` It happened because we invested in that community, and we've got to do that in cities all over this country, including <PERSON> Paterson </PERSON>.'' In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted that the state has elected Democrats statewide, including Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who campaigned by his side on Saturday, and Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, who faces a tough re-election battle and did not appear with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Yet <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> has not voted for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee for president since 1964. `` There is no reason the state that has given us <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> ca n't get back in the Democratic column this year. And we're going to make it happen,'' he said in <LOCATION> Montclair </LOCATION>.

 Their likeness is everywhere: on the city flag and the sides of city vehicles, on the uniforms of police officers, firefighters and city workers. By law they have the right-of-way on any street. Welcome to <PERSON> Olney </PERSON>, `` Home of the White Squirrels,'' the only town in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to boast a large colony of wild albino squirrels. `` It's our mark of distinction, to put it bluntly,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Lathrop </PERSON>. `` They're so darn cute.'' `` A lot of tourists _ ` course we do n't get a lot, being in the middle of nowhere _ stop by the park to see the squirrels,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON>, supervisor of public works in the town of 9,000 in southeastern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> `` This is <PERSON> Olney </PERSON>'s only chance for their claim to fame,'' said <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON>, whose uniform also sports a white-squirrel emblem on the sleeve. The squirrel also appears on the key to the city and on a <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> sign in the mayor's office. There's a stuffed white squirrel on the wall of the City Council chamber. To protect the city's 150 squirrels, <PERSON> Olney </PERSON> enacted an ordinance in 1925 that gave the animals with white fur, white skin and pink eyes _ mutations from gray squirrels _ the right-of-way on any street. Should a motorist break the law and kill one, he faces a $ 25 fine. Ditto for taking one out of town. `` The city goes crazy over them,'' <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stencel </PERSON>, a local zoologist, said the white squirrels have inhabited <PERSON> Olney </PERSON> since the early 1900s. He said colonies of albino squirrels, which he described as groups of about 25, are rare. Other states, including <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, do have them, he said, but none are the size of <PERSON> Olney </PERSON>'s. `` It's one of those things that you claim it, and let somebody else prove us wrong,'' <PERSON> Stencel </PERSON> said. The squirrels thrive because, in addition to being protected by law, people feed them. On a recent day, a handful of townspeople sat around the city park, waiting to give them a meal. Only three appeared. <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON> explained that during the summer when the temperature is high and people splatter about the nearby city pool, the squirrels stay in their hollow trees. `` I think they're wonderful,'' said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, who had packed apples for the squirrels. `` They're our pride.'' <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON> brought her 2-year-old nephew, <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, to see the white squirrels, though she forgot a bag of peanuts at home. Said the mayor: `` You really ca n't appreciate these little animals until you see them.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> alumnus was charged with arson Sunday for allegedly torching makeshift shanties on the Ivy League campus that were built by students to protest South African apartheid, authorities said. Dr. <PERSON> Elwood </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracey </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who apparently was visiting the university for alumni weekend, was stopped by a jogger near the blazing shanties, police said. He was released on $ 50,000 bond pending a Monday court appearance, police said. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Charney </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> psychiatrist and class of 1968, said he saw a man running away from the fire as he was jogging across the campus Sunday morning. `` I yelled fire and ran after him,'' said <PERSON> Charney </PERSON>. `` He was in a tan suit, tie and his class button, which he took off as he ran.'' <PERSON> Charney </PERSON> said he caught up with the man in the courtyard of one of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s residential colleges, where the two had a political discussion about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, apartheid and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s investment policies. `` In my opinion he acknowledged he had done it and he did it because he had strong feelings on this and felt alumni should have their say,'' <PERSON> Charney </PERSON> said. `` He also said he had given <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> a lot of money.'' The man told him he had worked in a hospital in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for three months, <PERSON> Charney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Benno </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who had defended the university's decision to allow the shantytown to remain standing during a meeting Saturday with visiting alumni, denounced the arson as a `` lawless act of violence.'' `` To destroy them by an act of impulse is the antithesis of reason and order that is the essence of a university or any civilized community,'' he said in a statement. `` Beyond that, to set the shanties on fire furtively in the midst of an urban campus is an extremely dangerous thing to do.'' All that remained standing after the fire was a wooden shrine draped in the yellow, green and black colors of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and pasted with sheets of paper listing the names of 250 people who have been killed in the struggle against apartheid. `` It was a cowardly thing to do,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morand </PERSON>, a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> graduate who helped build the shanties as a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartheid </ORGANIZATION> and now works in the university chaplain's office. The shanties were erected in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> administration building in April 1986 to protest apartheid and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> investment policies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Officials ordered the shanties dismantled but allowed them to be rebuilt after students agreed to maintain them. <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> owns stock only in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that subscribe to the <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Principles </PERSON>, a set of ethical guidelines aimed at improving the lives of South African blacks and ultimately at dismantling apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s policy of racial separation. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Littell </PERSON>, a university spokesman, was unsure how much of <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s stock portfolio was invested in companies doing business in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. As of 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> had about $ 385 million invested in such companies.

<TEXT>
 The missing second act of an opera by Italian composer <PERSON> Gaetano </PERSON> <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON> has been found in the cellar of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, four years after an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> musicologist discovered its first and third acts there, the Sunday Times reported. The lost portion of the three-act `` <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON>'' was discovered last week by Australian conductor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonynge </PERSON>. He is currently leading his wife, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, in a production of <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolena </PERSON>'' at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> at Covent Garden. The Times quoted him as saying he made the discovery `` absolutely by chance, in an old stack of ballet rubbish -LRB- music -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON>, who was born in 1797 and died in 1848, composed the work in 1838. The opera, set in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, tells the story of a young woman's walk from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to try to win her father's freedom from exile `` Elisabeth'' first surfaced four years ago when <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Crutchfield </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> musicologist, found the first and third acts. It is n't known how the score of the music got to Covent Garden. The fact that the pages are singed indicates it may have been near a fire, possibly one that broke out at the opera house in 1856 or one 11 years later at Her Majesty's Theater, to which <PERSON> Donizetti </PERSON> had unsuccessfully offered the work. `` We are now looking for the first possible opportunity to bring this opera before the ublic _ it will probably be within 18 months and initially in a concert version,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Findlay </PERSON>, the director of Covent Garden.

 With lots of milk and corn flakes, <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> retained its title as the breakfast capital of the country by serving 32,697 people and beating the record set by <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.

 This little piggy going to market wanted to be the one that stayed home, and its break for freedom at a city intersection caused a police chase aided by broom and lasso. The 250-pound pig, part of a load of hogs being taken to Granite City Livestock Sales, jumped off the back of its owner's truck at a busy street corner and trotted off to a residential area. `` He must have climbed on the backs of the other pigs in the truck, then he leaped out,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, a witness who helped capture the animal after its Thursday morning getaway. `` It's remarkable for a pig to walk away from a jump like that without broken legs. He must have jumped about four feet,'' <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said. The pig ended up in the back yard of <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Proell </PERSON>. `` He came down the alley and then wandered up to my fence. The cop was right behind him,'' said <PERSON> Proell </PERSON>, who was watering his lawn. `` I figured I could guide him with a broom and keep him against the fence,'' <PERSON> Proell </PERSON> said. `` I was talking to him, trying to keep him in this corner.''

 Tamil rebels slit the throats of four Tamil civilians early Sunday and pinned notes to their bodies claiming they were traitors, the military said. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, who could not be further identified under briefing rules, said authorities found the four victims near a bus stop in the northern port city of <LOCATION> Velvettituari </LOCATION>. Notes written in the Tamil language and pinned to their blood-stained shirts read: `` This is the fate that befalls traitors.'' It indicated that the victims were believed to be informants for Indian peacekeeping troops in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Velvettituari </LOCATION>, 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION>, is the hometown of <PERSON> Velupillai </PERSON> <PERSON> Prabhakaran </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are the largest of the groups battling the Indian soldiers, who are in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to enforce an accord aimed at ending the Tamils' separatist war. The Indian-mediated accord, signed in July, calls for the Tamils to lay down their weapons in exchange for some autonomy. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, claim discrimination by majority Sinhalese. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the dispute because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Federal Prosecutor Pressured Meese From Wedtech Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> withdrew himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> investigation only after a prosecutor refused to share evidence in the case with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> unless <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> disqualified himself, a newspaper reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> quoted high-level sources as saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> wanted written proof that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> would not be supervising the case involving the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> defense contractor. The now-defunct company is at the center of an influence-peddling scandal regarding its efforts to obtain government contracts. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s refusal in March 1987 to forward evidence to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prompted top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> officials to warn <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> in early April 1987 of evidence linking him to the case, the newspaper said. The Justice officials warned <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to `` publicly distance himself'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case and `` stay away'' from his close friend, <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, then a key suspect in the case, the newspaper said, quoting officials who spoke on condition they not be identified. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s financial adviser, <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, were indicted in December on charges they accepted bribes in exchange for using their influence with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. Federal investigators were looking into <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s links to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in October 1986. But, five months later, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> still had not formally withdrawn from supervision of the investigation. One high-level <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> section told the News it was `` clearly improper, if not illegal'' conduct by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> for failing to quickly disqualify himself from the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> investigation. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> signed a recusal statement on April 8, 1987. However, the News said, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> told his aides that he might have a problem keeping his distance from <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. He had just offered <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> a $ 77,500-a-year job as counselor to the attorney general. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s consideration of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> for the post was dropped as soon as he became aware of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s status in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case. Sources told the News that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions in the case put <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in a delicate position and created an appearance that the probe was subject to irregular pressures and interference from the top. Department regulations forbid <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> officials to have any involvement in criminal investigations ion which they or their associates have a personal or political interest. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON>, denied <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> disqualified himself only after <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> refused to hand over evidence. `` Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> recused himself the moment he was aware that Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was a subject of Mr. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s investigation,'' <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> said Sunday. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who is prosecuting the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trial of Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, declined to comment on the matter.

<TEXT>
 The leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday criticized political restrictions and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, saying the crisis `` weighs heavily on the smallest people.'' Speaking at the traditional Corpus Christi Mass held this year in an open field and attended by nearly 40,000 people, Archbishop <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> political leaders to resolve the dispute. He said their actions `` will determine the future of this country for generations to come.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> after Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, was indicted in February by federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florifa </LOCATION> that accused him of drug trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who controls the civilian government, has rejected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to make him resign and leave the country. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> uses the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar as its currency and the sanctions have brought economic stagnation and increasing unemployment. People attending the Mass stood under a multicolored cover of thousands of umbrellas for the service by <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> and other members of the Panamanian conference of bishops. The archbishop pleaded for an end to what he called `` political restrictions inside and economic restrictions from abroad.'' He also said negotiations to solve the crisis `` must be in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and among Panamanians with the respect among the parties that is required by any dialogue.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been in and out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> meeting with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and other leaders trying arrange the general's resignation. <PERSON> Mcgrath </PERSON> said it was the responsibility of the Panamanian governemnt and the opposition to seek a solution. `` We beg them before God and their conscience to make all efforts to find the road to reconciliation and justice and peace for all,'' he said. In another development, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Deputy Secretary of State <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Abramowitz </PERSON> met privately with some opposition leaders. Opposition officials have criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, saying it bypassed them in its negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. One of the Panamanians at the talks, speaking with the condition he not be identified, called the meeting a `` a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gesture'' following the breakdown of negotiations between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoys and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` What can the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer now?'' he asked. `` This is just a formality.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> purportedly has offered to drop the indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if he would step down as head of the 15,000-member Defense Forces. School officials said they did not expect any serious problems Monday when nearly 700,000 elementary and high school students begin the new school year that should have started in March but was postponed because of the crisis. The national university suspended the semester and will resume classes July 20.

 A group of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> legislators asked the government to officially register prostitutes to ensure they receive regular medical checkups, it was reported Sunday. The parliamentarians, members of the 100-seat assembly, made the request during a meeting to discuss health care services, according to the state-owned Sunday Mail newspaper. Registration and regular medical examinations for prostitutes would curb the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases and acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the newspaper quoted the parliamentarians as saying.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with his eye on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s environmental vote, took another step Sunday away from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies by advocating a delay in a controversial offshore oil drilling project. `` Before going forward with new lease sales, we must be assured that the national treasure of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coastline will not be harmed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a ceremony dedicating the nation's first methanol pump at a commercial gasoline station. `` I have concluded,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` that the government ought to defer Lease Sale 91 off the coast of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' Lease Sale 91 is bitterly opposed by environmentalists. The Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing ahead with plans to permit drilling off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast and Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> planned to issue his report on sale 91 this summer, and it could go forward by the end of the year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advocated a delay two days before the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> primary but with more of an eye on the presidential election in November when the state's 47 electoral votes are considered crucial to both the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president and Democratic <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is a sure bet to sweep <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 175 Republican delegates in the winner-take-all GOP primary on Tuesday. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is heavily favored to take a lion's share of the 314 Democratic delegates in his contest with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has advocated an absolute moratorium on offshore drilling. On the flight to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, told reporters, `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recognizes the importance of environmental and quality of life issues in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was advocating the delay `` until next year giving his secretary of the interior an opportunity to study the matter and determine whether or not to go further.'' However, he said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes `` an absolute moratorium'' like the one called for by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke at the dedication of the methanol pump at an <ORGANIZATION> ARCO </ORGANIZATION> station at <LOCATION> Wilshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hobart </LOCATION> boulevards. `` A strong domestic energy industry is essential to our national security, and I am one who believes we've got strengthen the overall energy base of this country and protect the environment at the same time,'' he said. He acknowledged that `` sometimes these goals seem incompatible as with the current concern about offshore drilling. `` I was one of the pioneers in the equipment end of offshore drilling in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and I know it can be done safely. But there are other considerations _ tourism, marine life, aesthetics _ and in some extraordinarily sensitive areas, those considerations may prevail.''

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Russian Orthodox Church launched a yearlong celebration of its 1,000 anniversary Sunday with a special liturgy and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin. `` We are glad that our jubilee coincides with this very beneficial period in Soviet history,'' said senior church official <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filaret </ORGANIZATION>. About 500 religious representatives from more than 100 countries _ including a high-ranking <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation _ crowded into the large, stone Patriarchal Cathedral of the Epiphany to hear the liturgy led by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>. `` The Russian Orthodox Church blesses wholeheartedly the good developments in this country and calls on its flock to take an active part in the process of restructuring,'' said <PERSON> Filaret </PERSON>. Soviet television showed <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> and other Orthodox clergymen officiating at the ceremony as the strains of a male choir filled the opulently furbished church, which has five domes and three altars and dates from 1731. Several thousand worshipers crowded the cathedral, whose ancient icons and relics that are associated both with the history of the Russian church and the creation of the pre-Communist Russian state. Christianity was introduced by Prince <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kievan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rus </LOCATION> _ the ancient name of what is now the northern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> _ with a baptism ceremony on the banks of the <LOCATION> Dnieper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 988. In a rare show of cooperation between church and state, the state <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> participated in organizing events linked to the millenium. Cathedrals in the nation's oldest monastery _ in the <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> _ will be returned to the Russian Orthodox Church this week after 27 years of state ownership, according to church and state officials. <PERSON> Filaret </PERSON>, speaking to a news conference Saturday, noted that the state was also this year permitting the church to publish half a million copies of the Bible in the Russian and Ukrainian languages. The millenium celebrations come as the Soviet government is considering easing its religious restrictions. Since the repressive era of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the 1920s, Soviet worshipers have been required to register with the government and their church activities have been severely restricted. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> did not attend the ceremonies, although he has often expressed the desire to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that the Russian Orthodox Church did not extend an invitation to the pope. Russian Orthodox churchmen have said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was invited. The pontiff has said he would go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> only on condition that he be allowed to visit the heavily-Catholic Soviet republics. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has said he has been twice denied permission to visit <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, one of the country's <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> heartlands.

<HEAD>Dredge Spill Threatens Environmentally Fragile Marshes, Closes Sub

<TEXT>
 Diesel fuel from a dredge that sank in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marys </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> channel on the <LOCATION> Florida-Georgia </LOCATION> border is threatening sensitive marshes and disrupting <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> traffic, federal officials said Sunday. The channel remained closed Sunday, blocking both commercial traffic from the Port of <LOCATION> Fernandina </LOCATION> and military traffic from <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Submarine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, said Coast Guard Cmdr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrs </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. The dredge, which had been working to deepen the channel to accommodate the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s mammoth Trident nuclear submarines, foundered and sank in high winds and heavy seas Saturday morning. While most of the leaking diesel oil from the 168-foot-long <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> floated into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, some drifted inside the channel. Containment booms were erected to protect up-river creeks. Seven crew members from the <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION>, owned by the Great Lakes Dredging and <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, were plucked from the water as it sank in the 50-foot deep channel. A barge alongside broke away and drifted several miles south along <LOCATION> Fernandina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> before it was secured. Officials hoped the containment booms would keep the pollution from the tidal marshes of <LOCATION> Cumberland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, part of the federal park system. `` What's made this one more severe is not so much the oil, ... but it's spilled in a critically sensitive area,'' said <PERSON> Rohrs </PERSON>. `` And of course you're blocking a channel. You've got the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and commercial traffic.'' He said no oil had hit the marshes. Also, no commercial traffic was scheduled to enter the channel until Monday or Tuesday. A sonar survey of the channel has been planned to see if ships can navigate around the dredge. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Pezio </PERSON>, on-scene coordinator, said the sunken dredge contained 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel. He estimated that at a rate of 500 gallons an hour, the fuel would leak for three days. `` The wetlands here are sensitive, we're prepared to physically protect those wetlands,'' <PERSON> O'Pezio </PERSON> said Saturday. He added they are not planning to clean up the fuel drifting in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> because it has not reached beaches. The Great Lakes Dredging and <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will have to pay for cleaning up the spill, <PERSON> O'Pezio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the company's project superintendent, said he did not know what it would cost To assist in the clean up, the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, a federal environmental pollution response unit, was dispatched to <LOCATION> Fernandina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> Saturday. A member of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulation </ORGANIZATION>'s hazardous waste response team also was there to monitor the spill. Also alerted was <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosling </PERSON>, the founder and director of BEAKS, <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Kare </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanctuary </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Mosling </PERSON> said she was prepared to help whatever birds may be suffering affects from the oil spill. `` Diesel is very poisonous to birds,'' she said. `` Not only does it burn their skin, but inhaling it burns their lungs.''

 A car bomb exploded near a police station in this northwestern city early Sunday, slightly damaging the station and six cars but causing no injuries, police said. The explosion occurred at 6:28 a.m. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the incident, police said. Police believe the explosion was the work of the separatist <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> of the Galician People because the explosives used were similar to those in past incidents attributed to the same group. The group is fighting for independence from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> for the four-province <LOCATION> Galicia </LOCATION> region. It has carried out a dozen attacks on electric plants, bank offices, police cars and industries in the region in the past eight months, police said.

<HEAD>Jackson Vows To Launch Voter Registration Drive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Sunday that he will fight at the Democratic convention this summer for a party commitment to change practices that impede voting rights. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, campaigning in advance of Tuesday's primary here, also said he intends to push hard at the convention on a range of issues he considers important, including shifting defense spending to health care and housing, changes in party rules on delegate selection, and campaign finance reform. Although he used the word `` fight'' in his speech, he modified that in talking to reporters later, saying his quest `` for fairness must not be seen as a fight.'' `` Fights come when you fail to negotiate ... when people have made a decision to go in opposite directions,'' he said. While putting the party on notice that he will demand a say on several issues at the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also pledged Democratic solidarity, announcing his <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> would sponsor a massive voter registration drive beginning Aug. 1. The drive will focus on women, minorities, young people and laborers, he told a church congregation here. `` But we will go further than that,'' he said. `` In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> the Democratic party must make a commitment to empowerment _ in the platform, in the party on the ticket.'' He did not specify whether his reference to the ticket meant he should be given a major say in who the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate will be. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s comments came as top campaign officials indicated a growing sentiment that he should be offered the vice presidential nomination if <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> becomes the nominee, as expected. Campaign chairman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> assembly speaker, and state co-chairwoman, <PERSON> Assemblywoman </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON>, both voiced that opinion on Sunday, going beyond <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s own statements. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has said he has earned consideration as a running mate, and that he likewise would consider <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> if he himself should win. `` A lot of us around him feel he should be'' offered the vice presidential spot, said Waters. Of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' contention that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> be weighed as a potential running mate but will get no special consideration, she said: `` We all know games when we see them.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>,'' said considering <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> should mean actually offering him the No. 2 spot on the ticket. `` I think consideration means literally extending the opportunity to go on the ticket, and then it will be up to Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to determine whether or not he wishes to accept it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Asked about <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s comment, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` That's his point of view.'' Told that Waters had said she would stay away from the polls in November if <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is not treated fairly by the party, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I hope everybody will be at the polls in record numbers.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said his voter registration plans will go ahead regardless of whether he gets his way at the convention. In a day of appearances around the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> repeatedly invoked the memory of the late civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and former Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, assassinated 20 years ago Sunday on the night of his presidential primary victory in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said party rules must `` reflect the example of Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the inspiration of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also said `` it is shameful 20 years after the death of <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ that we continue to deprive many citizens of the right to vote.'' He said he will fight for party rules changes in current practices of dual priamries, winner-take-all threshholds, unelected super delegates `` and other party impediments to one person, one vote.'' He cited studies that have found registration and voting is effectively shut off for people in some parts of the country due to short or inconvenient registration hours, inconvenient and far-away locations of registration offices, and registration cutoff deadlines a month or more before the election, before many people start focusing on the campaign. Such practices are controlled at the local and state level. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> urged passage of legislation in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would allow registration on election day.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s campaign chairman said Sunday the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket should be his to turn down if front-runner <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ends up with the party's presidential nomination. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, when asked about the remarks by campaign chairman <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said: `` That's his point of view.'' Later, campaigning in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told an audience at a church, `` In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must make a commitment to empowerment _ in the platform, in the party, on the ticket.'' He did not elaborate on his reference to the ticket. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s remarks, noted that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself has said the nominee should have the choice of selecting a running mate. `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is n't thinking about the vice presidency until the 7th of June,'' <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said. `` In terms of Rev. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he is n't ruling anyone in or anyone out.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has earned the right to be considered as a running mate for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> _ and that, he said, means the offer must actually be extended. `` I think consideration means literally extending the opportunity to go on the ticket, and then it will be up to Mr. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to determine whether or not he wishes to accept it,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was conciliatory in his reaction to reports that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would continue campaigning after the round of primaries in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> on Tuesday, when the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor hopes to pick up the delegates he needs to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. `` He's a very strong person who's done an extraordinary job of winning votes and winning support,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Paterson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, before heading for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> later Sunday. `` I hope and believe we're going to have a good relationship. We have in the past,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` I suspect he's going to be out there campaigning hard for the Democratic ticket this fall.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was within 270 delegates of locking up the presidential nomination, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not yet have half of the 2,081 delegates needed to win. In all, 466 Democratic delegates are at stake in Tuesday's four primaries. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has had the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nomination locked up since April 26, was heading for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Sunday as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, a close political ally, again denied that he was preparing to take over management of the campaign. `` No, I'm not poised to go over there. For now I think that my job is at the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' `` I can only tell you that there is no agreement, no arrangement, no deal.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on Sunday, courted environmentalists with a call for a delay in a controversial offshore oil drilling project that the administration has been proceeding with. The Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> has been pushing ahead with plans to permit drilling off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> planned to issue his report on a lease sale off <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> this summer, and it could go forward by the end of the year. `` Before going forward with new lease sales, we must be assured that the national treasure of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coastline will not be harmed,'' the vice president said. He also attended the opening of the nation's first methanol pump at a commercial gasoline station. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had the Republican nomination locked up since April 26 and has been running alone since television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> suspended his candidacy on May 16. Nevertheless, there are pockets of lingering bitterness within the party. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> supporters stormed the podium at the <LOCATION> Snohomish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, GOP convention on Saturday, where there were shoving matches and microphone cords ripped out of the wall. The meeting, controlled by <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> forces, erupted over a rule allowing individuals to cast multiple votes for a single candidate for state convention delegate.

<HEAD>Group Found In Desert To Be Returned To Mexico</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A journey north to look for work by 36 Mexican nationals became a struggle for survival when they encountered weekend temperatures estimated at 110 degrees in a remote <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> desert. `` I did n't know about the desert,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON>, 30, after he and 35 others were found wandering without water northwest of here. `` There is water in <LOCATION> Oaxaca </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to his native state in southern <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. Most of the group, which included one woman, were in generally good condition when found Saturday afternoon, despite having been without food and water for nearly a day. Three were given intravenous fluids for dehydration at <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, a nursing supervisor said. `` We're glad nobody died. With this soaring heat, we responded with everything we had in an attempt to save lives,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowdy </PERSON>, chief patrol agent for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> sector. The high temperature in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> Saturday was 108 degrees, one degree higher than the previous record high set in 1946. Officials estimated it was at least 2 degrees hotter on the desert floor in the area in which the group was found. About 70 bodies have been found in the same general area since 1980, according to figures released last summer by the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. The group crossed the U.S.-Mexico border apparently by jumping the international fence about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. A massive search was launched by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials after two men left the main group and stumbled onto a remote ranch Saturday afternoon. Several members of the group said they had given up their ideas of finding work in this country and concentrated on staying alive after they ran out of food and water. Just before they were found, the group came upon a small, stagnant pool of water. `` We thought, ` At last, life has returned.' Even though it was pretty ugly -LRB- the water -RRB-, we drank it. The thing was to cool our parched throats,'' said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. The only woman in the group, <PERSON> Dominga </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 18, was wearing a printed T-shirt with a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, logo, but would not say where she got the shirt. `` I'm looking for work,'' she said. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 40, said he left his wife and six children in search of work in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There is work there, -LRB- in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> -RRB- but the pay is real cheap,'' he said. He said he was not aware that it is illegal in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for employers to hire illegal aliens. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said his work as a laborer earned him 10,000 pesos daily, roughly $ 4.34. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, 36, said the large group actually formed over the course of days as several smaller groups converged by accident in the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> desert.

 Athletes and entertainers who have n't let cancer stop them helped people celebrate National Cancer Survivors Day around the nation Sunday. `` I've tried to let people know there is life after cancer,'' said Olympic gold medalist <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Blatnick </PERSON>. `` I've dedicated myself to showing what a person can do, and helping other people believe they can do the same.'' The observance was organized by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and `` Coping,'' a national magazine for cancer patients. <PERSON> Blatnick </PERSON>, who won his gold medal for wrestling at the 1984 Olympics, joined about 150 cancer survivors and 400 patients at the Regional Cancer Center in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blatnick </PERSON> overcame two bouts with <ORGANIZATION> Hodgkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> in 1982 and 1985 With radiation therapy, <PERSON> Blatnick </PERSON> recovered from his first battle with cancer while training for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> games. His second bout was fought with chemotherapy and he is now in remission. Doctors said his fine physical condition helped in his fight against the disease, according to A.J. <PERSON> Drexler </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Hamot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vincent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, two hospitals in <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>. Skier <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, an Olympic gold medalist and amputee, was the star attraction at a observance at <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` So many people equate the word ` cancer' with death,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON>, 25, who lives in <LOCATION> Lincoln </LOCATION> when she is n't on the road as a full-time amateur skier. `` What we -LRB- survivors -RRB- are saying is, that's not necessarily so. Miss Golden, who prefers crutches to a prosthesis, lost her right leg above the knee to bone cancer when she was 12. She won a gold medal in the giant slalom in the disabled division demonstration event at the Winter Olympics in <LOCATION> Calgary </LOCATION> this year. Comedian <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, also a former cancer patient, agreed to address an observance at the Rush Cancer Center in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` There are over 100,000 cancer survivors in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, the Rush center's director. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> was diagnosed as having colon cancer in 1985, said his spokeswoman, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>. `` He is in the same fortunate category as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in that they had the same kind of surgery for the same kind of cancer, with, happily, the same results,'' she said. `` Neither man seems to have suffered any subsequent ill effects.'' More than 600 people, more than half of them cancer survivors, turned out at a five-hour picnic at <LOCATION> Florham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> division of the cancer society. Three bands volunteered their time, the Great Adventure Amusement Park donated clowns, cartoon characters and a robot for children, and the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> donated a tent. `` It was wonderful,'' Ms. <PERSON> Gannon </PERSON> said. `` I have never talked to so many upbeat people in my life.''

 The numbers game turned into a waiting game Sunday as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Lottery officials waited for holders of two winning tickets to claim a $ 51.2 million jackpot, the biggest ever in a North American lottery. The holders of the winning tickets can not claim their share of the prize until the start of business Monday. Each winning ticket in Saturday's Lotto 6-49 drawing is worth $ 25,618,116, payable over 20 years, said lottery spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Schade </PERSON>. The lottery's computers determined that the two winning tickets were sold at a liquor store in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, about 45 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and at a supermarket in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>. The computers can not identify the owners of the tickets, though. The winners will be announced when they present their tickets at lottery offices for verification. A small crowd of reporters and store employees gathered at the <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> supermarket, hoping the winning ticketholder would come in to announce the win. `` They usually show up at the retail outlet,'' said lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kossack </PERSON>, who was waiting at the store. `` We've had big, big winners never surface ... but with jackpots this size, I do n't think that will happen.'' `` It's just crazy right now,'' said store clerk <PERSON> Sheri </PERSON> <PERSON> Routh </PERSON>. `` So far we do n't know who the customer is, but we have all the news stations here.'' The odds of picking all six numbers out of 49 were about one in 14 million, said lottery officials. The winning numbers were 48, 42, 9, 14, 19, 31. Tickets cost $ 1 each. The waiting game capped three days of frenzied Lotto playing. At the peak, sales hit $ 4 million an hour. Sales on Saturday alone totaled more than $ 33 million, a one-day record, spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. Weekly sales normally average about $ 23 million, officials said. Lotto players clutching $ 20 bills were lined up 40 deep by 6 p.m. Saturday at a bakery in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. `` We've had people buying $ 1,000 worth of tickets, $ 400, $ 600 ... $ 50 is nothing. There are $ 50 buyers all over the place,'' said bakery president <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. The late rush pumped millions of extra dollars into the grand prize pot before sales were halted at 7:45 p.m. Saturday, 13 minutes before the drawing. `` At 4 p.m., our ticket sales pushed the Lotto prize past $ 46 million, past the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> record,'' previously the biggest <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lottery prize, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said Saturday. That <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> jackpot was awarded in October. The biggest previous <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> jackpot, $ 25.4 million, was split by two players in October. The lottery drew players across state lines and from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Tahoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tom </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, the fat pot drew <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> residents away from casinos across the border, three blocks away. `` We were joking yesterday that it would be funny to have the -LRB- ticket -RRB- line up to the state line and have the casino executives wonder what's going on,'' said owner <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>.

 The Russian Orthodox Church launched a yearlong celebration of its 1,000 anniversary Sunday with a special liturgy and a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier near the Kremlin. `` We are glad that our jubilee coincides with this very beneficial period in Soviet history,'' said senior church official <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Filaret </ORGANIZATION>. About 500 religious representatives from more than 100 countries _ including a high-ranking <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> delegation _ crowded into the large, stone Patriarchal Cathedral of the Epiphany to hear the liturgy led by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Patriarch <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON>. `` The Russian Orthodox Church blesses wholeheartedly the good developments in this country and calls on its flock to take an active part in the process of restructuring,'' said <PERSON> Filaret </PERSON>. Soviet television showed <PERSON> Pimen </PERSON> and other Orthodox clergymen officiating at the ceremony as the strains of a male choir filled the opulently furbished church, which has five domes and three altars and dates from 1731. Several thousand worshipers crowded the cathedral, whose ancient icons and relics that are associated both with the history of the Russian church and the creation of the pre-Communist Russian state. Christianity was introduced by Prince <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Kievan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rus </LOCATION> _ the ancient name of what is now the northern <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> republic of the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> _ with a baptism ceremony on the banks of the <LOCATION> Dnieper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in 988. In a rare show of cooperation between church and state, the state <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION> participated in organizing events linked to the millennium. Cathedrals in the nation's oldest monastery _ in the <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> _ will be returned to the Russian Orthodox Church this week after 27 years of state ownership, according to church and state officials. <PERSON> Filaret </PERSON>, speaking to a news conference Saturday, noted that the state was also this year permitting the church to publish half a million copies of the Bible in the Russian and Ukrainian languages. The millennium celebrations come as the Soviet government is considering easing its religious restrictions. Since the repressive era of dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in the 1920s, Soviet worshipers have been required to register with the government and their church activities have been severely restricted. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> did not attend the ceremonies, although he has often expressed the desire to visit the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> said earlier that the Russian Orthodox Church did not extend an invitation to the pope. Russian Orthodox churchmen have said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was invited. The pontiff has said he would go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> only on condition that he be allowed to visit the heavily-Catholic Soviet republics. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> has said he has been twice denied permission to visit <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, one of the country's <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> heartlands.

 President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, shunned by many nations because of allegations about his actions as a German army officer, met with King Fahd Sunday after receiving <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s highest decoration. Diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two leaders discussed efforts to end the Iran-Iraq war and the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict and also bilateral relations. Fahd gave <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>, a former secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, a red carpet welcome when the Austrian leader arrived for a three-day state visit on Saturday. Fahd later hosted a banquet at which he decorated <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> with the Cordon of King <PERSON> Abdel-Aziz </PERSON>, the nation's highest decoration. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> is the fourth nation that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has visited since being elected president in June 1986. He has been to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and has an invitation to visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But he has been shunned by many countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which barred him from entering the country because of allegations about his actions as a German army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> from 1942 to 1945. A historians' commission in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> that investigated the allegations said in February that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was `` in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, knew they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them. But it did not support allegations that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was involved in committing atrocities. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and some other Arab countries have claimed that a campaign accusing <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> of complicity in World War II atrocities is being directed by Zionists because of the Austrian president's stand toward Arabs. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> canceled visits to <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> after leaders of those countries were called to an emergency Arab summit on Tuesday. Representatives of all <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> nations except <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> will meet in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> to express their support for the Arab uprising in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The uprising, which began in December, is the only item formally on the agenda of the three-day summit that opens in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> under the chairmanship of Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday night that President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will remain in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> to direct the war against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The auxiliary archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> called on his followers Sunday to pray for President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, but said the president's absence may help end the 8-year-old civil war. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> went last week to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for treatment of cancer. `` The absence of the president permits political antagonists to not think so much about demolishing their enemy,'' Roman Catholic Monsignor <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> told reporters after Mass at the Metropolitan Cathedral. `` The political debate will have less passion, and that is favorable,'' he said. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 62, has been in the <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since Tuesday night. He has cancer of the stomach and liver. It is widely presumed in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is in the final year of a 5-year term, will not be able to resume the presidency. Vice-President <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> is the acting chief executive. Before discovering his illness, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> began talks with the two parties beside his centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> that are represented in the legislature. <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> said last week he planned to continue and broaden that initiative with the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to draft a consensus to be presented to leftist rebels. In three fruitless rounds of talks since 1984, the rebels have demanded a role in a broadly based transition government. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> has rejected the demand, insisting that the rebels must lay down their weapons and compete in elections. In his homily, <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> referred to an all-night prayer vigil on behalf of <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> at the cathedral. The facade of the building was draped with banners reading `` <ORGANIZATION> Duarte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lives </ORGANIZATION>, Today and Forever,'' and `` Duarte: God and the people are with you.'' But only about 150 people were taking part in the visil as of midnight.

<TEXT>
 An influential <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> figure who reportedly stands ready to step in and resolve movie and television industry labor disputes is the subject of a federal racketeering probe, a newspaper reported Sunday. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON>, 66, has been under investigation for about 18 months by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. The department has used telephone wiretaps, among other means, to determine if he and his associates have been coercing production companies into hiring them to guarantee labor peace, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> said the allegations are groundless and that his success at ending costly labor problems is a natural talent. He also said he has never been paid for his help, except for serving as a paid consultant on the film `` Rhinestone.'' `` If people come to me, and they believe me, and they trust me, is there something wrong with that?'' <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> said. `` If they want to convict me for my God-given talents, they better bring God into court.'' Strike force attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stavin </PERSON>, who is reportedly directing the inquiry, refused to discuss the case or confirm that <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> is being investigated. <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> has played a quiet role in solving labor impasses in many productions, including such TV shows as `` Miami Vice'' and `` Magnum P.I.,'' and on the films `` Rhinestone'' and `` Foul Play,'' the Times said. <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> says he was told by the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> listened in on telephone conversations between him and union chief <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Presser </PERSON>. The Times also said it learned the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s organized crime unit tapped calls between <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> and a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police detective who allegedly tipped him about the federal probe. That detective, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 53, recently took early retirement after his alleged information leak became public. Fellow Detective <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, 45, received a month-long suspension for failing to report St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s activities, the report said. The racketeering probe is investigating alleged Teamsters union involvment in film industry labor dealings and resulted in grand jury subpeonas being served on <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>'s film studio, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>, the Times said. <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>, who was introduced to <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> by <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> and went on to work in the union's 1986 anti-drug campaign, was not served with any personal subpoenas. Subpoenas have also gone out to some entertainment industry labor unions, including the Screen Extras Guild and the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' primary bargaining unit in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, Local 399, according to the report. <PERSON> Bacow </PERSON> described himself as a retired scriptwriter and producer, and claimed to have no affiliation with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>, a contention supported by union officials. <PERSON> Presser </PERSON> could n't be reached for comment because he is recuperating from surgery for brain cancer.

 Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said Sunday that talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> this week on compensation for damage to diplomatic property are not designed to help win the release of British hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. But his deputy, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>, said the talks could `` warm up'' relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which worsened after expulsions last year left only one Iranian diplomat in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and one British diplomat in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said on Saturday that a four-man Iranian delegation will arrive on Tuesday for talks with Britih officials on damage to the Iranian Embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and damage to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> building and other British diplomatic property in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. If an agreement is reached under the British proposal, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> will pay <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> $ 3.24 million for damage to its embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and give <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> $ 360,000 to maintain the building. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would pay <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> $ 1.6 million for damage to British buildings in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. There are 18 foreign hostages held by Moslem extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans and three Britons. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. It is believed the hostages are held by members of the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, organization. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, a lawmaker from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and vice-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> British-Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliamentary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said on Sunday a compensation deal could mean that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was moving toward paying for the release of the British hostages. `` It now seems that the government is following the route of the Americans and the French in buying out their hostages,'' he said. But <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio, dismissed <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s contention as `` absolute rubbish, irresponsible rubbish.'' In an interview on TV-AM, <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> insisted the talks with the Iranians had nothing to do with the British hostages who include <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, the archbishop of <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION>'s special envoy who disappeared in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Jan. 20, 1987. `` There is an argument about the damage done to the Iranian Embassy premises here and the damage done to our embassy premises there,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. He added: `` That is what it is about. There is nothing of wider significance. Our policy on hostages is absolutely clear _ no deals.'' <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had always been prepared to hold talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> `` and to warm up relations.'' `` If we can sort out these questions of damage to diplomatic properties in both of our countries, well, from an acorn grows an oak,'' he said. From time to time, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has raised the question of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> assisting in the release of the hostages on a purely humanitarian basis, `` not as a bargaining chip in some rather squalid deal,'' <PERSON> Mellor </PERSON> said. Such a deal would almost certainly make it more likely that other hostages would be taken and `` drag the name of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> through the mud,'' he added. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said the compensation talks will focus on damage to the Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> building at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Princes Gate, which caught fire when British commandos stormed it in 1980 to end a hostage siege, and on damage to British diplomatic buildings and the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The British properties were damaged by mobs in 1978, 1979, and 1980. `` We want compensation for the damage to our property in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and we want to ensure that the necessary repairs are done to the Princes Gate property, which is a health hazard and an eyesore,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Saturday. Following the release last month of the last three French hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, families of the missing Britons have been pressing the government to help secure their release. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disasppeared while on a mission to try to win the release of some of the hostages. The other British captives are <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a journalist kidnapped April 17, 1986, and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, an English teacher at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> seized April 11, 1986. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> is from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> but holds an Irish passport.

 A panel of former judges on a commission of inquiry arranged by two television companies said Sunday there was insufficient evidence to determine if <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> committed war crimes as a German army officer. The panel issued its decision on the Austrian president and former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> general-secretary after hearing nine days of testimony in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in April. Witnesses included officers who served with <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> in the German army in World War II and survivors of concentration camps and civilian massacres. The inquiry was paid for by <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, both of which screened a 3 -LCB- - hour program program Sunday night that included some of the testimony and the decision by the jurists `` We conclude unanimously that the evidence which has been put before us is not enough to make it probable that Lt. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> committed any of the war crimes alleged against him in this inquiry,'' the panel said. The five judges also found `` lapses and aberrations of memory such as Dr. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> seems to have had about his services in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> are not in themselves evidence of guilt.'' But the commission said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` must have known'' about German plans to shoot captured Italian officers. The former judges who participated in the inquiry came from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has been shunned by many countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has barred him from entering the country, because of allegations about his actions as an army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> from 1942 to 1945. A historians' commission appointed by the Austrian government that investigated the allegations said in February that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was `` in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, knew they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them. But it did not support allegations that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was involved in committing atrocities. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. The panel that participated in the television inquiry was headed by a retired <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge, Sir <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON>. Other members were <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufstedler </PERSON>, a former circuit judge for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, and West German <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubner </PERSON>, Swede <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Petren </PERSON> and Canadian <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> _ all retired appeals court judges.

<HEAD>American Women Beat Soviets In World's Largest Card Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> women overcame a challenge from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to win the largest global card game ever played, the World Bridge Federation announced Sunday. It said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horwitz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Norante </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, won the bridge contest beating 84,356 rivals who played simultaneously in 94 countries beginning at 8 p.m. Friday and ending Saturday morning. Results, tabulated Saturday, were released Sunday by the federation, which organized the event. Their winning score on 24 bridge hands was 76.33 percent. The same hands, which took an average of 3.5 hours to complete, were played at each location in 2,500 cities. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, competing for the first time, held a comfortable lead until <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the last to join the elaborately timed schedule, turned in its results. Names of the Soviet players, who scored 75.92 percent, were not given. `` We got a call with the results from the official bridge league in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but the line was bad and we were cut off before we got the names or where they had played,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dormer </PERSON>, spokesman for the bridge federation. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Epson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contest </ORGANIZATION> will take a place in the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> as the biggest bridge contest ever played, beating out a record set last year by the same contest in which 73,256 people participated. <PERSON> Dormer </PERSON> said the contest also holds the record for the largest number of people competing simultaneously in any sport. By coming in second worldwide, the Soviet pair will be recognized as the European champions. <PERSON> Dormer </PERSON> said that although 50 million people worldwide play bridge, it had been frowned on in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a frivolous, capitalist game. However, he said, it has gained greater acceptance since Soviet world chess masters <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> have been seen playing it between chess rounds. Third place winners were from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and were identified only as <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rane </PERSON>. They scored 75 percent.

<HEAD>Instructor Says Others Forced Mirecki into Pool</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Several <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rescue swimming instructors forced a recruit into a swimming pool shortly before he collapsed and died, despite his protests that he wanted to quit, two instructors testified Sunday. Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jablonowski </PERSON>, a safety observer at the time of the March 2 death, said the instructors `` more or less tossed'' Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> into the pool at <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION>. `` They put him back in the water,'' said Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giles </PERSON>, an instructor. `` He was n't thrown into the water. He was more or less slid into the water.'' The two men testified during a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigative hearing here on involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit battery charges against five instructors and a dereliction of duty count against the school's commanding officer, Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>. The hearing, scheduled to continue Monday, is to determine whether the six should be court-martialed. A doctor testified Saturday that <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, died of apparent heart failure most likely induced by fear. `` I remember him saying, ` I ca n't do it, I ca n't do it,' `` <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said. `` I remember him saying he did n't want to go back in the pool.'' <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said he could identify only one of the defendants, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, as being among a group of instructors who forced <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> back into the pool. <PERSON> Jablonowski </PERSON> said he could remember another defendant in the group, Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON>, another of the defendants, took charge of the instruction session when <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> first left the pool. <PERSON> Jablonowski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Blevins </PERSON> was known around the school as `` the Antichrist.'' Neither <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Jablonowski </PERSON> were charged. After <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> was back in the water, <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said he talked to him and the recruit calmed down. But he said that within minutes, Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> dived in and put <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> into a head hold. The exercise called for recruits to extricate themselves from such holds. Earlier testimony indicated that after he was forced back in the water, <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> grabbed on to a rope dividing the shallow and deep ends of the pool but <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> and Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON> pulled him loose. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> and Zelenock were the other instructors charged. <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jablonowski </PERSON> both said <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> apparently escaped from the hold by <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> just before collapsing. <PERSON> Jablonowski </PERSON> said he signaled to end the exercise when he noticed <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> getting weaker. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> then brought <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> to the side of the pool where instructors and corpsmen tried to revive him, <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said there was no formal policy requiring one or more instructors to remain out of the water as safety observers, but that they took turns observing during the drill, he said. Under questioning by Cmdr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. D'Alesio, the investigating officer, <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> said there was no release signal for students to give if they were in trouble while in an instructor's grasp and that there was no formal safety indoctrination as part of the course taken to become an instructor. Under questioning by lawyers for the defendants and government, <PERSON> Giles </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Zelenock </PERSON> punched <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> and said he was unable to recall when during the series of events students were told to turn away and sing the national anthem. Students had testified they were told to sing when <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> allegedly was being forced, screaming, back into the pool.

 Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> gave cautious backing Sunday to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign for the presidency. Interviewer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> on TV-AM if <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> would prefer Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to his probable Democratic opponent <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` One has to be very cautious about expressing opinions on elections in other countries because it is part of the democratic process. One works with the leader who emerges at the end of the day,'' the foreign secretary replied. `` But at this stage it would be less than human if we did not recognize the value of working with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with whom we have worked for a long time,'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said. `` If there is anything in the over-simplified left-right divide in politics, he is on the right in politics and so are we in this country.''

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Sunday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be to blame if peace talks with Nicaraguan rebels scheduled to begin on Tuesday fail to produce a permanent cease-fire. `` We hold the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government responsible for what happens in these meetings'' with the Contras, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said after meeting with agricultural, industrial, health and education workers. Leaders of the Nicaraguan Resistance, the Contra umbrella organization, are scheduled to hold talks with government officials June 7-9 in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. It would be the fourth session held in the Nicaraguan capital to negotiate terms of a permament truce to the 6 -LCB- - year-old civil war <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> also said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration would be at fault `` if in this meeting the Contras do not agree to lay down their arms.'' The rebels, trained, funded and supplied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, began their war to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government in 1981. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in an interview after his speech that his government would offer `` no variations'' to its peace proposal submitted during the last round of negotiations held May 26-28. The Contras turned down a government proposal for a 30-day cease-fire extension and a plan for delivering humanitarian aid to rebel units athered in truce zones. Both sides have agreed to hold their fire at least until the end of this week's talks. The government agreed to discuss some of the Contras' demands for political changes they say would bring about democratization in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Those include freedom of the press, the lifting of all political restrictions, separation of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> from the army and the government, constitutional changes and electoral and judicial reforms. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said on Sunday the rebel delegation would be permitted to visit leaders of the internal opposition and the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> during its stay in the capital. The Contra delegation planned to travel to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on Monday to prepare for the talks, said a rebel spokesman in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on Sunday.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> failed on Sunday to persuade <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to accept terms set by King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> for holding <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> peace talks. `` I think on the whole we had a good discussion about this,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said before flying back to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` As far as any major shift in anybody's position, I can not report that.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said at <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> airport, `` We are going to stay engaged and do everything we can for the balance of this -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- administration to accomplish as much as we can and leave for our successors as constructive and positive situation as we possibly can.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> had two meetings with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in an effort to persuade him to agree to negotiate with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> with a commitment for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to exchange land in the occupied territories for Arab recognition. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also met in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> and members of the Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense committees. He told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a public statement that `` the continued occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and the frustation of Palestinian rights is a dead-end street.'' He added: `` The belief that this can continue is an illusion.'' He also spoke of the prospect of another war in a region where long-range missiles and chemical weapons have proliferated. The next war, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` will be unlike any conflict we have seen before, involving more casualties and proving harder to contain.'' King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, in talks Saturday with <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>, insisted on an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commitment to withdraw as a precondition for accepting the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> proposal for peace talks. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said he had emphasized to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> `` the need for King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s side to feel there is something to negotiate about.'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> lost the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which it controlled from 1948 until 1967, in the six-day war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said despite his failure to persuade <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, `` I can report what seems to me a very genuine desire to be engaged and to be involved, not just for the sake of being able to say that, in a genuine search for peace.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who is based in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> during his <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> shuttle effort, will go to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> Monday for talks with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> about the faltering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace plan and the Arab summit meeting that opens Tuesday in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> hopes to persuade the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> leader to take a moderate position. The secretary of state will then go to <LOCATION> Luxor </LOCATION> to visit ancient Egyptian sites. A Shamir adviser said the prime minister and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> discussed peace options but he did not elaborate. He said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> `` ensured <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that the relations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be strengthened in the future.'' The adviser, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON>, accused King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of attempting to negotiate the disposition of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We prefer him to say this to us directly,'' the Israeli official said. The occupied lands were virtually shut down Sunday for the third day of a strike called by leaders of the Arab uprising to protest <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s visit.

The plan calls for an international peace conference in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, as the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, would serve as hosts. The negotiations would be aimed at self-rule for 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, but not a separate state. In a second stage, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Arabs would try to find an overall settlement to their conflict.

 The Socialists and conservatives virtually split the popular vote in Sunday's first round of elections for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. French television projected President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s Socialists will win the most seats. Based on 97 percent of the ballots counted, the Socialists had 37.4 percent of the vote when the counting was stopped late Sunday. The conservative Rally for the Republic and center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, which backed the same candidates, garnered 37.7 percent. The Communists took 11.2 percent and the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> 9.7 percent, with the rest going to minor parties. Counting was to resume Monday. State-run Antenne 2 network's projections gave the Socialists between 310 and 330 seats in the 577-seat assembly. It said the Rally for the Republic and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> would win 230-250 seats and the Communists 10-20, with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> shut out. In predicting the makeup of the new assembly _ the lower and more powerful house of Parliament _ the television network projected the final outcome for all districts including areas that will have runoff elections next Sunday. Candidates needed at least 50 percent of the vote in the first round to win a seat in the legislature. In districts where there was no winner in the first round, candidates had to receive at least 12.5 percent of the first-round votes to be eligible for the June 12 runoff. There is inevitable pressure on those coming in lower than second to drop out and support one of the two frontrunners in the runoff. This system was expected to hurt the smaller parties but help the Socialists. In 1986, before the new system was adopted, seats were assigned on the basis of the percentage of votes won by lists of candidates. Projections showed 65.5 percent of the 38 million people eligible to vote cast ballots _ one of the lowest turnouts in recent years. That compares with 78.5 percent in the March 1986 legislative election and 81.4 percent in the first round of the presidential election April 24. Polls had predicted a wider Socialist advantage. `` It's an encouraging result, but we have to consolidate it,'' said former conservative Finance Minister <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Balladur </PERSON>. `` Victory is possible if we unite. We have a week to convince all those who do not want to give a majority to the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' Polls also predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> _ which each won 35 seats in the last election _ would fare badly because of the winner-take-all voting system reinstituted two years ago. The election came less than a month after <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> defeated former Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, a conservative, with a solid 54 percent of the vote. Conservatives controlled the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> from 1986 until <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> dissolved it after his re-election. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had said during his presidential campaign he wanted to work with the existing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and open the Cabinet to non-Socialists from the political center. New Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> formed a government with no notable presence from other parties, however, and <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> called the election. The Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche noted in a front-page editorial that despite the importance of the election for the future, `` the campaign gave rise only to boredom or indifference.'' Few issues were debated. The Socialists declared they were ready to institute a guaranteed minimum wage, to be paid for in part with a special tax on large fortunes. Such a tax was abolished by the right in 1986. Socialists continued with <PERSON> Mittterrand </PERSON>'s `` opening'' theme through the campaign, but most politicians of the right and center-right viewed the idea as little more than an invitation for them to become Socialist.

 A panel of former judges on a commission of inquiry arranged by two television companies said Sunday there was insufficient evidence to determine if <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> committed war crimes as a German army officer. The panel issued its decision on the Austrian president and former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> general-secretary after hearing nine days of testimony in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in April. Witnesses included officers who served with <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> in the German army in World War II and survivors of concentration camps and civilian massacres. The inquiry was paid for by <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, both of which screened a 3 -LCB- - hour program program Sunday night that included some of the testimony and the decision by the jurists `` We conclude unanimously that the evidence which has been put before us is not enough to make it probable that Lt. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> committed any of the war crimes alleged against him in this inquiry,'' the panel said. The five judges also found `` lapses and aberrations of memory such as Dr. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> seems to have had about his services in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> are not in themselves evidence of guilt.'' But the commission said <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> `` must have known'' about German plans to shoot captured Italian officers. The former judges who participated in the inquiry came from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has been shunned by many countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has barred him from entering the country, because of allegations about his actions as an army lieutenant in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> from 1942 to 1945. A historians' commission appointed by the Austrian government that investigated the allegations said in February that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was `` in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>, knew they were going on and made no attempt to prevent them. But it did not support allegations that <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> was involved in committing atrocities. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. The panel that participated in the television inquiry was headed by a retired <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge, Sir <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON>. Other members were <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Hufstedler </PERSON>, a former circuit judge for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, and West German <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubner </PERSON>, Swede <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Petren </PERSON> and Canadian <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> _ all retired appeals court judges.

 Officials said Sunday that rescuers made radio contact with some miners hours after a disastrous mine explosion but ordered them to stop sending signals so they could try to find trapped victims. The statement from the mine owner confirmed a report from one of six miners found alive Saturday in an air pocket 500 feet underground. It fueled allegations that searchers bungled their work after Wednesday's blast that is believed to have killed 51 miners. One newspaper declared the incident `` a scandal.''

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters, who sparked a nationwide taxpayer revolt with Proposition 13 a decade ago, are being asked in a series of ballot measures whether they are having some second thoughts. Although gloomy predictions of fiscal disaster remain largely unrealized since the measure cut property taxes by $ 7 billion, or an average of 57 percent, Proposition 13 has had its visible effects. The public increasingly pays for services that once were free, including parks and recreation programs. Public grounds look scruffier than they did 10 years ago as officials have cut back on maintenance. State bailouts and creative funding schemes are credited with keeping most local governments afloat since the measure was approved June 6, 1978, but many agree that schools and rural counties have suffered under the cuts.

<HEAD>Company Makes Lethal Injection Machines, Electric Chairs, Gallows</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The name masks the purpose: <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is in the business of death. Lethal injection machines, electric chairs, gallows and gas chambers form the catalog of equipment designed and built by American Engineering, believed to be the only company in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that exclusively makes execution equipment. Four years ago, it created the first computer-controlled machine to regulate the flow of drugs in a lethal injection. Five states have bought the $ 30,000 device, company president <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said, from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in 1984 to <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> earlier this year. In 1983, an engineer friend of <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s heard a disc jockey mocking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> because it advertised for executioners. The idea was planted: how to automate lethal injection. `` The methodology that's used in the lethal injection on a manual system is barbaric,'' <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said, who runs the company and a financial consulting firm from a storefront here. The basic complications in lethal injection, both <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> and death penalty opponents agree, are ruptured veins, inaccurate dosages and failure to immediately induce unconsciousness. Of the 37 states where capital punishment is legal, 16 prescribe death by lethal injection. Some, like <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, have n't executed anyone in decades and have electric chairs and gas chambers that might not work if needed. According to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, 98 people have been executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the death penalty in 1976, including five this year and 25 in 1987. More than 2,020 inmates populate death row, <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> figures show. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> contracted for one of the machines last year after the state changed its capital punishment law to lethal injection from hanging, said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Laggner </PERSON>, chief of administration and operational support for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>. `` It takes away the element that you do n't have any Hippocratic oath problems because all you need is someone to set up an i.v.,'' <PERSON> Laggner </PERSON> said of the machine, which <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> bought along with a $ 60,000 execution trailer designed by American Engineering. Civil libertarians rail at that sort of thinking, saying there is no ethical justification in making executions easier or more efficient. `` The worst sin of all is to do that well which should n't be done at all,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzschild </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>'s capital punishment project. `` The notion that a homicide becomes nicer if you do it nicely is morally outrageous,'' he said. A 3-by-4-foot gray box with a row of switches and red lights, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>'s machine is mounted to the wall above the inmate's gurney. Intravenous tubing inserted by a medical technician into the inmate's arm runs through the wall to a computerized control module. Two executioners push one button each to start the machine, so neither knows who actually activates the pistons that send the three deadly drugs through syringes and into the inmate. A dosage of sodium pentathol renders the inmate unconscious. The second drug is pancuronium bromide, or Pavulon, which in large doses paralyzes body functions. The third, potassium chloride, ensures heart arrest. The execution should take four to six minutes. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said the prisoner wo n't feel anything. `` He's going to go out and that's the end of it. Over and out.'' American Engineering, with assets of about $ 100,000, has a limited market for its wares. But <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> feels the condition of the nation's execution devices and the lack of competition could mean more contracts. For states that do n't use lethal injection, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> also designs electric chairs, gas chambers and gallows. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said he has sold three electric helmets at $ 5,000 apiece and three sets of leg stocks at $ 2,000 each, and redesigned one gallows for $ 15,000. Citing confidentiality, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> refused to identify the states involved. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said he opposes capital punishment, but noted that if it's going to be done, `` it should be done right If we're going to hang this person then we should be using the proper rope. And you ca n't blame the rope-maker for the hanging.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Consider Giving More Power to Investors in Stock Disputes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first instinct of thousands of investors shocked by the almost instant evaporation of their money in the October stock market crash was to sue their brokers. It was then that many got a second shock: They discovered they had signed away their right to go to court. Fine print buried in most brokerage firms' paperwork requires customers to settle disputes through an arbitration hearing sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> or other market organization. Arbitration, because it is cheaper and faster than suing, is a good deal for many customers, particularly those who claim damages of $ 50,000 or less. But there is only a limited right to appeal and some investors _ big losers and those whose brokers' actions were especially egregious _ may be better off in court. And even investors likely to recover all or part of their losses in arbitration may not want to give up the option to sue before they know the nature of the dispute. Big institutional investors have always had the clout to negotiate contracts with securities firms, but a survey earlier this year by the staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> found that individual investors have little choice. Of 65 firms, handling 90 percent of all customer accounts, virtually all require arbitration, particularly for customers who borrow money from the firm through margin accounts or trade in risky stock options. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, concerned that mandatory arbitration adds to the popular perception that the markets are stacked against the individual, are hoping to restore customers' right to choose Three states _ <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> _ are also considering proposals to restrict arbitration clauses, according to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of state regulators. The issue is becoming more acute as the number of arbitration cases soars because of the crash and because the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last June upheld the legality of mandatory arbitration clauses. The association said that the number of cases quintupled from 800 in 1980 to 4,100 last year and could climb above 6,000 this year. At a recent <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> hearing, Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said that he believes arbitration offers `` a fine opportunity for cost saving,'' but as a matter of fairness, firms ought to be barred from denying service to a customer who does n't want to sign an arbitration clause. `` I fail to see why we should deny access to the securities markets to one who is unwilling to waive their dispute -LRB- into arbitration -RRB- in advance,'' he said. Commodity brokers are already forbidden to force customers to arbitrate. The commission, for two hours last Wednesday, debated whether to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to extend the ban to securities brokers. But, after last-minute lobbying by the securities industry, it postponed the decision for a month to give firms a chance to press their opposition. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> are trying to craft a solution to a problem that does not exist. The system is fair; only a very small percentage of complaints to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> are about arbitration, he said. And, he said, the market organizations are moving to put in place a number of changes recommended by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> last September. They include education for arbitrators and guidelines designed to keep people with industry ties from serving in the `` public'' slots on arbitration panels. Moreover, firms are not denying customers access to the market, <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said. Most do n't require customers with cash accounts to sign arbitration clauses, he said, and customers who want to borrow money on margin can go to banks or elsewhere. The proposal before government officials `` essentially says to a broker-dealer you no longer have a right as a businessman to make a judgment to control your legal expenses through the use of arbitration,'' he said. `` It makes no sense to force disputes ... into a court system where it takes five to seven years to get a case out and nobody wins except the trial attorneys,'' he said. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> appears to have the backing of a majority of his five-member commission. <PERSON> Aulana </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> is firmly in his corner and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said he would have to be persuaded to vote against the proposal. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is proceeding on its own. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on finance scheduled a hearing on the issue for Thursday. Rep. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va., is preparing legislation that would require firms to present arbitration clauses under a heading with large type and on a separate sheet of paper Firms would be forbidden to reject customers who decline to sign the clause or charge them an added fee for refusing. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said he reviewed one form used by several firms and found the arbitration clause in small print in a section with an unrelated headline. `` Even a very careful reading of the form might not reveal the binding arbitration language. I was looking for it and it took me quite a while,'' he said. `` That to me is improper. If a person is going to surrender his right to a trial in court, the person should do so with full knowledge and, secondly, it should be a purely voluntary decision,'' he said.

 The health of the economy is at risk. The federal debt is swelling, and the politicians are gridlocked. What's a nation to do? Call in the bureaucrat! That may sound a little odd, but a consummate <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> insider was required to direct the new bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in its mission to cut the deficit. The commission director not only needed a thorough knowledge of the budget, but had to be trusted by both sides of the political spectrum. And, perhaps most important, someone was needed with skill in handling giant egos. Enter <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON> of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>. Described by a colleague as `` the quintessential staff person,'' <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON> first worked at <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> in 1961, before it was <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>, when it was just the Bureau of the Budget. He's made a career of public service, mostly at <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> but also overseas as an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>, he has worked for Democrats and Republicans, <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Stockman </PERSON>. Now <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON> has to use that experience to stay in the background but still guide the commission members to a conclusion on the deficit by their self-imposed deadline of December 21st. The common wisdom in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is that the commission would provide political `` cover'' for a tax increase and some spending cuts, leading <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already to pre-emptively say he wo n't support it But <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON> says predicting the commission's actions would be a mistake, and he wo n't try to read the minds of members who include <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> and former Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>. `` If you have n't decided what time you're going home tonight, I ca n't forecast it. And if I do, I'm a fool,'' he said in an interview last week. With the commission just starting up, <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON>'s major effort is to educate the members, most of whom have little exposure to the federal budget. His staff is creating a computer game, where members can try out different policies and instantly receive a computation of their effect on the deficit. The co-chairmen of the commission are <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and Democratic party power broker, and <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION>. It will be their job to plead and cajole the panel toward a consensus, with <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON> smoothing whatever path they choose. The deficit commission is frequently compared in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the so-called <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> commission, led by now-Federal <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, whose recommendations led to the 1983 financial revamping of the Social Security program. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has even moved into the townhouse across from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> where the <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> group was based. However, <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON> says this mission is different. Social Security was facing a crisis, and there was the threat that the checks would not go out unless action was taken. While most economists agree that the federal deficit, $ 150 billion last year, is bad for the economy, its effects are more difficult to single out. `` If we were able to say that on the 13th of March, 1989, the stock market will drop -LRB- unless action is taken -RRB-, then we've got a deal,'' <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mathiasen </PERSON> agrees that perhaps the most important factor in whether the commission succeeds will be the attitude of the next president-elect. Before taking office, the next president can appoint two more commission members. The hope of the panel is to prevent its work from getting snarled in presidential politics, but then quickly make its recommendations to help build a consensus on how to reduce the deficit for the next president and next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact.

<HEAD>Proposition 13 Still Being Felt 10 Years Later</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> voters, who sparked a nationwide taxpayer revolt with Proposition 13 a decade ago, are being asked in a series of ballot measures whether they are having some second thoughts. Although gloomy predictions of fiscal disaster remain largely unrealized since the measure cut property taxes by $ 7 billion, or an average of 57 percent, Proposition 13 has had its visible effects. The public increasingly pays for services that once were free, including parks and recreation programs. Public grounds look scruffier than they did 10 years ago as officials have cut back on maintenance. State bailouts and creative funding schemes are credited with keeping most local governments afloat since the measure was approved June 6, 1978, but many agree that schools and rural counties have suffered under the cuts. So on Tuesday, voters in 26 of the state's 57 counties will decide whether to raise sales and other taxes in their areas to pay for highways, schools, libraries, jails and other services that were threatened or eliminated by Proposition 13. At the same time, two rival statewide measures _ Proposition 71 and <ORGANIZATION> Proposition </ORGANIZATION> 72 _ will ask voters whether to ease a constitutional spending limit and provide more money for schools or highways. The spending limit, in the form of an initiative written by tax-cut pioneer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gann </PERSON>, was approved in a special election nine months after Proposition 13. It requires that spending be strictly tied to increases in population and the nationwide cost of living. The two new measures would alter that limit. Proposition 71, whose main supporter is state schools Superintendent <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, would permit additional funding for schools. Proposition 72, written by <PERSON> Gann </PERSON> himself, would allow new money for highway construction. Republican Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, grappling with a $ 1.1 billion budget deficit, opposes both measures. Other issues on Tuesday's ballot include a proposal to empower the state to quarantine AIDS victims and local measures that could close the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant and divide <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> into two. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> also is holding a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary, along with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, in addition, is having primaries in both parties for governor. Proposition 13 _ whose war cry was quickly picked up by voters in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and other states _ decreed that property tax assessments be rolled back immediately to 1975-76 levels. It limited annual property taxes to 1 percent of the market value and stipulated that assessed values, and thus taxes, could be increased by only 2 percent annually until a property is sold. Then the new owner's property tax bill starts at 1 percent of the purchase price. The measure also made it extremely difficult for local school districts to raise property taxes, requiring that voters approve any new taxes by a two-thirds margin. The year before Proposition 13 was approved, local governments received $ 10.3 billion in property taxes, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equalization </ORGANIZATION>. In 1978-79, the first year after Proposition 13, that figure plunged to $ 4.9 billion. The immediate crunch was eased by the state, which contributed $ 4.4 billion in 1978-79, but over the years that state support has worn thin. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Houx </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said there is little money for vocational education, after-school sports and fine arts programs for the state's 4.5 million students. `` It's not like it was before, when the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> could raise money locally, and for the big bucks we could go to the voters and ask for approval with a simple majority,'' said <PERSON> Houx </PERSON>. Many school libraries have been closed or forced to curtail their hours. More than $ 11 billion is needed for new school construction throughout the state, and deferred maintenance costs are approaching $ 150 million, <PERSON> Houx </PERSON> said. The city of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s street repair unit faces $ 60 million in deferred maintenance costs that built up in the eight years after Proposition 13 passed. In 1986, residents approved a 15-year sales tax increase to pay for street maintenance and repair. An increasing number of residents of <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, in the northwestern section of the state, are driving on gravel as officials give up on maintaining many deteriorating roads. <LOCATION> Shasta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, with 125,000 residents, replaced a 73-bed public hospital that also served several neighboring counties with a clinic.

<HEAD>Business School Seeks To De-emphasize Wall Street Careers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> is making it clear that it wants a smaller proportion of its graduates to head for Wall Street investment banking. The business school reported last week that 15 percent of its current crop of graduates had been hired by major securities firms, compared to about 30 percent in 1987. `` We do n't want investment banking to be the be-all and end-all of a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MBA </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, the business school's director of placement School officials said they began shifting the emphasis away from investment banking even before last October's stock market crash. `` There was a real concern that we were being typecast as a school for investment bankers and consultants,'' said Professor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a technology management expert. `` Our mission is to train general managers. We were afraid of losing our heritage.'' The changes at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> included improving its manufacturing faculty, changing its admissions policies to de-emphasize financial skills and choosing fewer people from Wall Street apprenticeship programs. A decade ago, just 8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> graduates went into investment banking while consulting was the job of choice, attracting 22 percent. But the bull market that began in 1982 and the merger-and-acquisition binge that started soon afterward shifted the balance. In 1978, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> students could expect to earn roughly the same starting salary on Wall Street as in manufacturing. By 1987, Wall Street salaries were about 10 percent higher than those in manufacturing, but with bonuses figured in, the gap was closer to 50 percent. There were complaints that American manufacturing was being shortchanged. `` We now have a group coming out of business schools, going to Wall Street and contributing nothing to the efficiency of American industry, nothing to its productivity,'' retired <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Galbraith </PERSON> said in 1987. Last March, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> hired <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelwright </PERSON>, a specialist in manufacturing, from <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. But officials said the changes may still not funnel more bright young graduates into the production sector. `` We can do all the pushing and cajoling we want,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, `` but if companies do not offer jobs at competitive salaries, the students will not go that way.'' `` I tell students that tomorrow's chief executive officers will be the ones who solve our production problems,'' said <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurow </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Sloan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Thurow </PERSON> said his message is not taking root yet and that the business school students still consider manufacturing a second-class profession.

 Rail labor, finding itself `` backed into a corner,'' has softened its opposition to proposed random drug testing of railroad workers, union officials said. The change comes as the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> prepares to hold hearings in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on its proposal to mandate random drug testing for all train personnel working with moving trains. As recently as last Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> spoke in an interview of labor's `` uncompromising effort to stop testing in any form.'' He said some rail labor leaders seemed `` to care more about protecting the employees who use drugs in the workplace than those who do n't.'' But on Friday, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents rail unions, said, `` There has been a reconsideration of labor's position.'' While the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>'s random testing plan wo n't be finalized until sometime after the field hearings end, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said, `` It may be that labor will be able to embrace it.'' Still, he said he had constitutional questions about the plan, in part because it seemed `` to assume that those who are tested are guilty.'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> also said the proposed program does not appear to do enough to promote rehabilitation. `` There should be a cooperative program encouraging people to seek out rehabilitation before a problem occurs,'' <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. While <ORGANIZATION> RLEA </ORGANIZATION> represents some 20 unions, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said he did not necessarily speak for all the members. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> said the best drug programs resulted not from legislation, but from agreements between individual railroads and unions. But he said labor was `` backed into a corner'' by the inevitability of congressional action on random testing. `` Lets face it, there will some kind of legislation passed one way or another,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. The DOT hearings, which begin in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on June 14 and end here two weeks later, are designed to solicit public opinion and help government lawyers shape the program. Transportation officials believe they have authority to implement random drug testing even though <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not passed legislation requiring such a program. Still, it would be a boost to the department's position if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acted, according to <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>. `` It would clarify our authority,'' he said. <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said the current rules for testing based on reasonable cause are limited because they are tied to a supervisor's ability to detect symptoms. `` That is a severe limitation in the drug area because many of the drugs in vogue in the workplace today can impair an engineer's time or spatial perceptions without giving rise to a symptom that would be recognized by even an educated laymen,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said Even before proposing random drug testing on May 5, attorneys for DOT were already in court defending mandatory drug testing for train crew members involved in major accidents. That program has continued while the department appeals a federal appeals court ruling on Feb. 11 that declared such testing unconstitutional. The court ruling stemmed from a suit filed by rail labor unions. A signal that labor has relaxed its opposition to random drug testing came in the response by union officials Friday to new legislation by Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>. His bill would give DOT 90 days to set up procedures for administering random drug tests. Significantly for labor, it contains provisions mandating rehabilitation and education, and protecting workers against inaccurate test results. `` We believe the bill is a constructive approach to substabce abuse in the workplace if random testing is to become law,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroy </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> RLEA </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` However, we still have serious constitutional concerns that we will not abandon without adequate safeguards,'' he said.

<HEAD>Saudis Report Big Trade Surplus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> posted a $ 2.4 billion trade surplus last year, more than seven times the 1986 surplus, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a report Sunday. The 1986 surplus totaled $ 360,000, said excerpts of the report that were circulated by the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The big increase followed a major effort by the Saudis to diversify their economy away from dependence on oil revenues. They have developed agriculture, wheat and food products for export, as well as domestic consumption. The ministry report said exports totalled $ 22.56 billion last year and imports $ 20 billion. In 1986 exports totaled $ 19.24 billion with imports pegged at $ 18.88 billion, the report said. The Saudi news agency did not provide any breakdown of export figures and gave only a partial list of import statistics. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> report showed 81.2 percent of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s imports last year came from 15 countries, headed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> Imports from <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> states last year increased by 8.6 percent over the preceding year, while imports from non-Arab Islamic states increased by 9.8 percent. The oil-rich kingdom's major import categories all rose last year, at least in value. The agency report only cited import values. They were listed as foodstuffs and livestock, which increased by 7.2 percent in value, beverages and tobacco by 12 percent, raw materials by 21.6 percent, vegetable oils and fats by 10.4 percent, machinery and transport equipment by 2.1 percent, furniture, clothing and shoes by 5.7 percent. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> sits on almost one-third of the world's proven oil reserves, but has been hard hit by a weak world oil market since the early 1980s. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has a population of around 12 million, including an estimated 3 million expatriate workers.

 Three years ago, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> set out to grab a share of the retail beer market _ a very small share. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> owns one of a growing number of micro-brewers _ small companies that make small amounts of beer, mostly heavier brews. Sales doubled last year, and <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, 29, hopes his <ORGANIZATION> Kalamazoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> will break even or even turn a profit this year. He began his business on $ 39,000 borrowed from friends in a former plumbing supply store with a 15-gallon pot and stove. While business has picked up a bit, everything still is done by hand. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> once said his brewery was the smallest in the country. He now produces about 1,400 barrels of ale annually, which may bring in about $ 250,000 in sales this year, mushrooming from the $ 65,000 in sales last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewers </ORGANIZATION> estimates there are 80 micro-breweries nationwide, up from 46 two years ago. Some speculate that the popularity of the breweries increased as people began looking for alternatives to light, highly carbonated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beers. Despite the growth of these small operations, major brewers are n't foaming about competition. Last year, less than 0.1 percent of the 187 million barrels of beer were consumed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came from small brewers. `` That's not a number that one takes very seriously,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinman </PERSON>, publisher of the Beer Marketers Insight newsletter. `` It would take tremendous growth before the micro-breweries have any effect on the industry.'' One of the big problems for little breweries is delivery. Beer that is n't pasteurized goes bad without refrigeration _ a problem that drove <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, out of business several years ago. The failure rate for small breweries is pretty high, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendel </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fermentation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` About one brewery in five closes down,'' he said. `` Some last four or five years, and some close in a matter of weeks.'' Meantime, <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> keeps pumping out his brew with an eye toward some mechanization. He bought a bottling machine, but it is in need of repair. He hopes to raise another $ 100,000 for more equipment. `` It's very difficult to make money when you're washing bottles by hand,'' he said. `` We're just starting to get to the break-even point, but it's been a real crap shoot.''

<HEAD>Professor To Present Study of Light Emitted By Wintergreen Candy</HEAD>

 Even party tricks can have scientific interest, and a <ORGANIZATION> Towson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> chemistry professor will tell a conference this week about the tiny sparks that appear when you bite wintergreen candy in the dark. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> has been researching the phenomenon _ technically known as triboluminescence _ for five years, crushing candies in her laboratory and carefully measuring the dim flashes. She'll present her findings at the third <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. She admits she also sometimes ducks into closets to crunch the candy and watch the bluish sparks of `` mouth lightning.'' Substances that flash when they're rubbed, crushed or broken include sugar, salt, quartz and human bones. Triboluminescence, a name drawn from the Greek word `` tribein'' meaning `` to rub,'' was first reported by Sir <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON> in 1605. Ms. <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON>, 46, took advantage of recent technological advances in highly accurate measuring instruments to confirm basic theories about triboluminescence developed in the 1930s and to add more accurate knowledge about the range of light emitted. She drew upon wintergreen candy studies conducted in the 1930s by <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON>. She said the tiny sparks are created because, when sucrose sugar crystals fracture under pressure, positive and negative electrical charges separate. Voltage builds up until electrons leap across the fracture and the discharge makes nitrogen molecules in the air emit a tiny burst of light. That light comes mainly in the invisible ultraviolet region of the spectrum. But when wintergreen is added, the light becomes visible as blue sparks because wintergreen molecules glow when excited by the flash of the initial spark, a tiny reaction that ends in milliseconds. Although he has not seen the results to be presented in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Zink </PERSON>, a professor of chemistry at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who furthered the research in the early 1980s, said he did n't find the mechanism to be quite as Ms. <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> described it. He said its behavior could vary from crystal to crystal. Ms. <PERSON> Sweeting </PERSON> said she stands by her research, which was `` very carefully done on the same batch of crystals.'' `` I guess most of the scientific community would think this is not real important,'' she said. `` But it's fundamental knowledge of crystals, how energy flows in and out of molecules, and there are going to be practical applications down the road.'' As an example, she suggested that a triboluminescent film could could be used to coat parts of orbiting satellites so that Earth-based instruments could detect any light emissions produced when the materials are put under unexpected stress.

 The race is on to develop new tools that can make the tiny silicon microchips that will run future generations of computers. `` The prize will be the entire world electronics market of 1996 and beyond,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, associate dean of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. With West German and Japanese electronics firms already jockeying for position, an electronic storage ring may just be the best tool <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry will need to keep pace. The special device can produce finely etched computer chips, the guts of the electronics industry. But building a new one from scratch could cost $ 15 million to $ 20 million, an hefty investment even for a large company. Yet in a cluttered metal building overlooking <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kegonsa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> is operating its own ring, dubbed <PERSON> Aladdin </PERSON>, and is willing to make the device available for industrial research. Chips now are manufactured by a process known as lithography, in which the myriad of components on a chip are printed on the wafer through the use of light-sensitive films and etching chemicals. Aladdin, which is 80-feet in diameter and uses as much electricity as a small town, can apply 800 million volts of spin to electrons to produce the `` soft'' x-rays that will allow even finer etching of computer chips than ultraviolet light can accomplish. The only other storage ring in the country that produces soft x-rays is at <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and it is booked solid. Last week, only 17 of <PERSON> Aladdin </PERSON>'s 36 available beam lines were in use, and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> hopes industry snatches up some of those still available. University scientists say it is time for <PERSON> Aladdin </PERSON> to do industrial research as well as academic research in x-ray lithography. The Japanese have spent an estimated $ 1 billion to develop the technology needed to build the new generation of smaller computer chips, said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> physicist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Huber </PERSON>, who is in charge of <LOCATION> Aladdin </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriated $ 15 million for such research last year and is expected to provide $ 35 million this year, <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> said. Among private companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, only computer giant <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has invested significantly in the technology, and even it realizes it can not carry the research burden alone, he said. `` There are 15 new rings now under construction in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. There is only one being built in this country,'' <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said. He said the Germans have had a thriving applied research program in x-ray lithography since 1978. `` If we do n't play a role, it's unlikely this country is going to embrace the technology,'' <PERSON> Huber </PERSON> said. `` Assuming the much earlier and larger Japanese and European investments do not render our program irrelevant before it gets started,'' <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON> said, `` the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> may actually have a chance to regain a competitive position in this technology.''
