 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has equipment capable of recovering the cargo door that sank in 16,800 feet of water after tearing away from a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet, an undersea technician said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has not decided whether to attempt to recover the door from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, said member <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. He said, however, that examining the front cargo door would be `` very helpful to us in our analysis.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> radar tracked a large object falling into the ocean about 45 seconds after the pilot of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s Flight 811 reported an in-flight emergency early Friday soon after taking off for <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said Tuesday night. Investigators suspect the cargo door popped open at 22,000 feet, tearing away with a large section of fuselage. Nine passengers seated on the right side of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 jet were swept to their deaths. The first lawsuits stemming from the accident were filed here Wednesday. <PERSON> Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sapolu </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, filed a state court lawsuit seeking unspecified damages from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the jumbo jet. According to court documents, <PERSON> Sapolu </PERSON> was serving drinks in business class when the hole opened in the right side of the aircraft. <PERSON> Sapolu </PERSON> said she was thrown to the floor and had to cling to the leg of a seat to keep from being swept out of the plane. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON> a passenger from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, also sought unspecified damages in his lawsuit filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, accusing from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> of neglect in maintaining the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747. <PERSON> Sapolu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON> said they suffered physical injuries and emotional distress. Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> turned the crippled jet around and flew it 100 miles on two of four engines, landing safely at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` The radar picked up something that could be a large piece of metal, possibly the cargo door,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. `` That information is going back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to see if we can indeed determine ... that was the cargo door, and its exact location.'' `` We have the location at the surface of the water,'' he said. `` You're talking about three miles -LRB- down -RRB-, one can only guess where that is.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolcott </PERSON>, a technician and submersible launch pilot at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Undersea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, said it would be difficult but probably not impossible to find the cargo door. A search for the door probably would begin with a towed underwater sonar sled to determine possible locations of the door and then the use of a remote operation vehicle equipped with a camera to pinpoint the location, <PERSON> Wolcott </PERSON> said Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has ROVs capable of hooking a line to the door so it could be pulled to the surface, he said. The least likely possibility because of the tremendous expense involved would be the use of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s San Diego-based Sea Cliff, one of the world's few manned submersibles capable of reaching that depth, <PERSON> Wollcott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s field work was nearly completed and investigators would leave <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> by Thursday. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president for operations, said the damaged jetliner will be repaired, although there was no estimate on when it will be returned to service. The air frame will be fixed in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and the engines will be repaired in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> told a news conference here Wednesday. About 10 of the passengers who were on Flight 811 remain in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> as well as a few survivors of the missing and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> is paying all expenses, <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> said. Two <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants are the only ones on the plane who remain hospitalized.

 Four young daughters of a poor factory worker swallowed rat poison in a suicide attempt aimed at easing the family's economic plight and enabling their brother to get an education, police said today. The youngest girl, 6, died. The others, aged 8, 10 and 13, were in serious condition. Their mother, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ok-soon </PERSON>, found the girls in the family's rented two-room apartment when she returned from grocery shopping Monday. Their 3-year-old brother was nearby _ unharmed. Police said the eldest daughter, Soon-mi, 13, regained consciousness and told police the sisters decided to kill themselves because it would leave more money for the parents and for education expenses to raise their brother. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspapers quoted the girls' teachers as saying they studied hard and were quiet, model students. But a neighborhood store owner said Soon-mi recently told him she could not afford $ 5.80 worth of notebooks and pencils she needed for school and asked to pay later. The father, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-bum </PERSON>, 44, supported the family of seven on $ 362 a month in factory wages, police said.

<TEXT>
 Graffiti has become such a scourge in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that city authorities intend to erect walls where people can scrawl whatever they please without fear of censorship, a spokesman for the mayor says. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, graffiti usually carries a political message and is most often quickly painted over by authorities with dull hues that accentuate the eyesore. Graffiti and other vandalism cost the city more than $ 1.8 million last year, and slogans scrawled during a `` happening'' Friday near <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s main department store caused $ 9,000 in damage, authorities say. Municipal officials decided Monday to build the free-speech graffiti walls at locations still to be decided, said <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopka </PERSON>, the mayor's spokesman. `` Everyone will have a chance to express themselves, if only the paint is no longer sprayed on the walls of our buildings or underground passageways,'' he said Tuesday. Scrawling on walls has a long tradition in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. A cross-and-anchor symboly with the initials `` PW'' for `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is Fighting,'' became a national symbol of resistance during World War II.

 Call it toothy gold, a get-rich quick plan for an area devastated by the crash of the oil market. Across <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s marshes, once flush with profits from black gold, small patches of land increasingly are being turned into alligator farms, with investors hoping to quintuple their investments in short order. `` Year before last, there were just under 9,000 farm-raised gators sold'' by 37 farms, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, alligator research coordinator for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION>. `` That number is going to reach 60,000 quickly and could be up to 100,000, certainly, within five years.'' That's in addition to the 24,000 wild alligators trapped each fall in carefully supervised hunts. Spurred by prices of $ 37 a linear foot for hides, 21 new farms have opened in the past two years, and `` We expect them to produce 18,000 gators,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The waiting list for permits for new farms is about 100. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 28, went into business two years ago near <LOCATION> Sweetlake </LOCATION> and expects to put 12,000 hides a year on the market. His farm is state-of-the-art: automated cleaning, water-source heat pumps, carefully supervised diets. The result is quicker growth at less cost. `` We have some are 5-6 feet long in a year and six months. We have 8-month-old gators that are 26-30 inches.'' Skins of wild alligators average seven feet in length, and are used for luggage. Farm-raised gators are skinned at two years old and about four feet long. Their hides are used for shoes, purses, belts and other smaller high-fashion accoutrements requiring smaller patterns on the hides. For about $ 30,000 a potential farmer can put up a couple windowless cinder-block buildings on concrete slabs and be ready to raise 1,000 gators a year. It would take another $ 25,000 to $ 30,000 to operate until the gators grew enough to sell. At current prices, 1,000 four-foot hides would bring $ 148,000. `` The minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up to two feet in length and 2 square feet up to four feet in length,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. Buildings must be able to hold a few inches of water and be kept about 89 degrees. The first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests, paying landowners for the eggs and committing 17 percent of the hatch for return to the wild at 4 feet long. That's a carefully researched percentage designed for zero growth in the population of 1.5 million wild alligators _ reached after the alligator was taken off the endangered species list in the mid-1970s. The wild nests are n't easy to find, and female alligators guard their eggs _ about the only time in their lives they show maternal instincts. No task for the timid, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> agreed. `` But everybody's got to learn some time or another, if they want to get into farming. `` Obviously, what would be best, for a guy's first involvement, would be to hire someone with a little experience in locating nests from the air. That's the only way to go: rent a helicopter and go find them and pick them up.'' The success of farming ventures will almost certainly drive prices down, and there are risks any time a market depends on fashion or something volatile, he said. `` I do n't think the bottom will fall out of the price. I do n't think they'll go to $ 2 a foot. But it certainly could go to half of what it is now.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a former trapper, commercial diver and underwater welder who now devotes full time to his farm, agrees with <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s analysis `` A lot of these farms, you'll see what happens. Prices are good right now, but with all these hides coming on the market, it's going to have to go down.'' But <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> believes he will survive when others fail because his expenses are low. `` Look at it this way, you've got an electricity bill of $ 500 a month to raise 1,000 alligators, and my bill is $ 150 a month to raise 12,000.'' His major problem is finding enough nutria _ small water rodents _ to feed the gators. Nutria often are dyed like beaver, and <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, `` The price of skins is so low, right now, that you ca n't get all you want. Last year I got 40,000 pounds, and I could have used 140,000.'' He had to supplement with fish and horse, and young alligators do n't grow as quickly on that diet. In addition, too much fish gives alligators gout.

 It appeared the French and English languages could live together in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> after separatist fervor abated nearly a decade ago, but the struggle resumed in December and French appears to have won. New issues arise constantly, such as whether the inside of a bus is really outside for sign purposes, and the answer almost every time is that the signs must be only in French. The English-speaking minority, although disgruntled, appears to accept that the fight is lost. `` Resigned is probably the right catchword,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, a psychology professor at <ORGANIZATION> McGill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Language is `` a symbol of identity and it also is a resource that has associated power, and status, and success and access,'' he said. `` So these apparently minor events evoke very primary feelings.'' <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> was a battleground of culture and language in the 1970s between the 81 percent with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> heritage and a minority with a cultural kinship to <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> and the other English-speaking provinces. Power shifted to the French-speaking majority in those years but the separatist tide ebbed after 1980, and with it the dispute over language, when <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> voters rejected a sovereignty referendum. Then came a ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> in December that a 1977 Quebec requiring all signs to be in French was unconstitutional. The court said French could be required to predominate on all signs but other languages could not be prohibited. The provincial government, which has broader powers than state governments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, overrode the decision with new legislation for the language on signs. Bill 178, as it is known, requires that all outdoor signs still be solely in French, but for the first time since 1977 allowed bilingual indoor signs. Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> described it as a compromise. Rallies by activists of both communities have accompanied the latest round. English signs posted in the street risk being spray-painted and a fire blamed on arson heavily damaged the offices of <LOCATION> Alliance </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, the main English-language lobby. Fewer street protests are held now, but the conflict continues as regulations under <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> 178 are interpreted to restrict indoor bilingual signs more than originally believed. `` It's taken 21 years, but the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> language war is finally over. And the English have lost,'' political columnist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> MacPherson </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>'s English-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview: `` My concern about Bill 178 is its silliness. You do n't like a law to be silly.'' As an example, he cited the <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> government's determination that the inside of a bus is really an outside location and thus not a proper site for bilingual signs. `` A lot of people in both communities were spoiling for a fight,'' <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said. `` The signs became symbols. Certainly the signs themselves are not what's at play.'' A prevailing view in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> is that the vigorous political fight of the 1970s spawned a new entrepeneurial spirit in the French community, as seen in the province's support for the new free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Business administration became the major of choice at French-language universities. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>'s provincial <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> trounced the nationalist <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> in 1985 elections. Many English speakers opposed to learning French left the province and, expecially among the young, bilingualism is becoming the norm. Alliance Quebec figures put the rate of bilingualism among the English community, which is centered in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, at 60 percent in 1986 compared with 37 percent in 1971. Until December, the issue of signs was portrayed as being no longer controversial. Since then, however, English speakers have described the denial of bilingual signs as a major violation of individual rights and the French say the restriction is necessary to preserve their culture in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` The language is the essence of culture,'' said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Filion </PERSON>, a Party Quebecois member of the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> legislature. `` This compromise -LRB- Bill 178 -RRB- is unacceptable to both the Francophone and the Anglophone.'' <PERSON> Filion </PERSON> said any relaxation of the sign law erodes <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> as the main language of the province. `` Our position is that Mr. <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> should have maintained the status quo,'' he said.

Gen. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON>, who led the last contingent of Soviet troops out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 14, said the allegation was `` monstrous.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has no evidence that Soviet airmen fired on their own soldiers, `` but he has heard it and he believes it,'' said his son-in-law, <PERSON> Efrem </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> refused to allow The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to speak directly with <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, who with his wife, <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON>, is staying with his in-laws in suburban <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>. `` He did n't specify from whom -LRB- he heard -RRB- this kind of accusation,'' <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> said. `` He's not the first to make these accusations.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> first made the charge in an interview with a Canadian radio station during a recent visit, according to an article in the Soviet military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> told the newspaper Tuesday that he had never seen a Soviet unit attack another to prevent capture and interrogation by the <ORGANIZATION> Mujahadeen </ORGANIZATION> rebels. `` I state definitely that there had not been nor could have been facts so monstrous,'' <PERSON> Gromov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yankelevich </PERSON> responded, `` On the basis of the facts -LRB- available to <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> -RRB-, he has no reason to retract his statement.'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Feb. 18 on their first such visit together. It is not known how long their visit will last.

 Even <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON> were no match for <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Principal </LOCATION> in a TV movie called `` Naked Lie,'' whose strong performance helped <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> remain out of last place for the fourth time in five weeks. `` The 31st Annual Grammy Awards'' also helped <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> take second place last week. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has won every week except for one tie with CBS. Never mind that the <ORGANIZATION> Grammys </ORGANIZATION> had its lowest rating ever, 16.0, and ranked 26th. It still did better than <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> usually does on Wednesday nights. Another strong performer for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was a special two-hour `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' that wound up with the highest-rated episode of the durable night-time soap so far this season. It had a 17.9 and was ranked 17th. Principal's thriller `` Naked Lie'' vanquished <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Revenge of Al Capone'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s reunion movie `` Get Smart, Again!'' to win Sunday night and finish ninth in the weekly <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings. Otherwise, the usual suspects rounded up the top 10: `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` 60 Minutes,'' CBS; `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dear John'' finished 10th, behind `` Naked Lie.'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which at 36 straight weeks is creeping up on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' record 40-week victory streak from 1962-63, won the week that ended Sunday with an average, prime-time rating of 16.2. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had a 14.6. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had 11.7. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. Taking the three network news anchors to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral did n't seem to produce extra ratings. The `` CBS Evening News'' had a rating of 11.7 and a 20 share. `` ABC World News Tonight'' had an 11.5 and 20 share. `` NBC Nightly News'' had an 11.0 and 20 share. The lowest-rated prime-time network shows of the week were: `` Mission Impossible,'' `` Dolphin Cove,'' `` West 57th,'' `` Almost Grown,'' `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> 75th Anniversary,'' `` Great Circuses of the World,'' `` TV 101,'' `` HeartBeat,'' `` A Fine Romance'' and `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law.''

<TEXT>
 If youse talk like dis and do n't know nuttin' about grammah and good English, do n't let <PERSON> Mayah </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> know Yup, you be axin' for it. This spring, the mayor and schools chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> are beginning a program to exorcise what <PERSON> Green </PERSON> calls `` speech demons'' from the lexicons of young New Yorkers who do n't know or use standard English usage. `` Axe'' instead of `` ask,'' for example. And `` pitcher'' instead of `` picture,'' `` brang'' for `` brought'' and `` meetcha'' for `` meet you.'' And, as <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> himself used to say, `` liberry'' instead of `` library.'' `` It was brought to my attention that I was saying ` liberry.' I was n't aware of it,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> admitted Tuesday. The program grew out of <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s conversations with some of the nearly 1 million students in the city school system. `` It's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkese </LOCATION> _ it's white, Hispanic, black,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, responding to suggestions that the new language program was aimed at ethnic or racial groups. `` The language in some cases was un-understandable,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, coining a word of his own. The mayor had asked <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to come up with a program to tackle the problem, and last week <PERSON> Green </PERSON> outlined it for <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and provided a list of the most commonly mispronounced and misused words and phrases. The effort starts this spring with a one-day `` Putting Your Best Speech Forward Day,'' during which teachers in all grades will focus on the list of speech demons. A poster contest will produce graphics that will be circulated throughout the system. The long-term plan includes more debating, oral reports, public service announcements and a booklet of classroom activities aimed at improving English. All this, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> wrote, should lead to `` substantive improvement of oral communication skills.'' -LRB- Say what? Better speaking, you betcha -RRB-. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said for young New Yorkers to compete with the best students across the nation and get good jobs, they must be able to speak English properly and `` at the same time maintain your own heritage and wherever possible to learn the language of your ancestors.'' Some linguistic experts say such `` non-standard English'' is a kind of dialect that is n't considered incorrect in the students' social setting Professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayer </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the effort could stigmatize some students. The chancellor's list, he said, included many phrases used by blacks and Hispanics. In his memo, <PERSON> Green </PERSON> pointed out that the program will make clear that `` our purpose is not to devalue anyone's home language. We will encourage students to recognize that to be successful in school and in the workplace, they must be able to use formal English effectively.'' `` This has nothing to do with accents,'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said, although the list shows `` cau-nuh'' for `` corner.'' `` It has nothing to do with diction, it has to do with syntax, grammar. And the expressions they're going to concentrate on are effectively <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkese </LOCATION>, and they cut across economics and race and ethnicity.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Merce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cunningham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> opened its season at the City Center on Tuesday with the premiere of `` Five Stone Wind,'' and the choreographer himself was among the dancers. For much of this 55-minute work, the stage is full of dancers but all are motionless except one or two. The primary motif consists of standing on one foot while stretching, bending and rotating the other leg. This is not a dance that flows. There are many entrances and exits, from five different points. Only occasionally do dancers move in unison or as duet partners. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>, who will turn 70 in April, does arm stretches, bends and turns, usually in the back of the group, once on stage alone. One would expect him to look silly among his trim, young dancers. But he fits the tone of the dance and makes one think about the effectiveness of one or two more mature dancers in the bunch. <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> is inventive enough, even pursuing one choreographic idea, to keep one interested throughout. Also, we like long dances so the evening is n't spent mainly in intermissions between short dances. Still, we became restless before the end. Costumes are leotard tops and skirts or pants, later leotards only for the women, in varying colors chosen by <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lancaster </PERSON>. The score was created by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON>, <PERSON> Takehisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosugi </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tudor </PERSON> and has a few painfully loud bursts of sound. The first part of `` Five Stone Wind'' had its premier in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> last June. The complete work bowed at the Festival d'Avignon in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in July. The evening began with <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON>'s 1968 `` RainForest.'' The company's <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> season runs through March 12, and two other premieres are scheduled: `` Cargo X'' and `` Field and Figures.'' The company will perform at the <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> March 16 to 18, at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> in Tempe April 1 and 2, <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> May 1 through 7 and C.W. <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> May 12. During July and August the company will dance in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>, the world-renowned scientist and author who won a Nobel prize for his pioneering work in the field of human and animal behavior, has died at age 85, the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>, who died of kidney failure Monday night, was famous both for his research and for the best-selling works on behavior that won him a worldwide reputation as a great humanist. Among his best-known books is `` On Aggression.'' In 1973, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>' behavioral research won him the Nobel Prize for Medicine along with the scientists <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nikolaas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinbergen </PERSON>. Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> said Tuesday the nation had lost a `` pioneering researcher and a humanistic thinker.'' In science, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> was known above all for his discovery of a process known as imprinting, or the rapid and almost irreversible learning process that occurs in early childhood, bonding animals to their biological mothers. But he showed the process could be changed, demonstrating that mallard ducklings, for example, would happily follow a human who greeted them shortly after birth and imitated quacking. To millions, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> was famed as the `` father of the gray geese,'' a man whose detailed studies of geese and other birds and animals led him to some penetrating and often gloomy conclusions about humanity and its future. His most controversial findings suggested that innate and instinctive behavior in animals, such as aggression, might be instinctive in humans as well. `` He was a man of genius, the founding father of ethology,'' said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> behavioral scientist <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chauvin </PERSON>, who was close to <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>. `` For me, he was a father figure,'' said Austrian scientist <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Loetsch </PERSON>, a student of <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON>. `` The thrust that this tiny land made in science and environmental thinking owes much to him.'' Born Nov. 7, 1903 in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the son of a well-known surgeon, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> gained his first doctorate in medicine in his native city at the age of 25. Five years later, after studies in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he held a doctorate in zoology and psychology on the basis of a thesis on the flight of birds. Between 1923 and 1939, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> devoted months to learning the `` language'' of the many birds he kept in his home. <PERSON> Chauvin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> was prompted to work with animals in nature after his studies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he noticed that the behavior of caged white rats he studied there differed from that of wild rats he had observed in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` He slept with geese, lying down beside them, to put their behavior in perspective, but also for observations on man and the child, without prejudices,'' <PERSON> Chauvin </PERSON> said. In 1939, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> was given a professorship in the German town of <LOCATION> Koenigsberg </LOCATION>, today the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION>. While there, he wrote papers considered to reflect Nazi views of science, making him the target of criticism years afterwards. In 1973, accepting the Nobel prize, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> apologized `` most deeply.'' `` Many highly decent scientists hoped, as I did, for a short time for good from National Socialism, and many quickly turned away from it with the same horror as I,'' he said then. In 1941, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> was drafted. Captured by the Russians in 1944, he spent four years as a prisoner of war, a time he later described as `` midway between being a teacher, a joker, a clown and a soul-soother.'' Returning home in 1948 with a manuscript written on sacks of cement and published years later as `` The Back Side of The Mirror,'' <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> founded a center for behavioral research in <LOCATION> Altenberg </LOCATION>. In the 1950s, he worked mostly in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where he headed the <ORGANIZATION> Max </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Behavioral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physiology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> from 1961 to 1973. Beginning in the 1960s, <PERSON> Lorenz </PERSON> authored a series of best-selling books including `` On Aggression,'' which was put out in German in 1963 and in English in 1966, `` The Eight Deadly Sins of the Civilized World,'' `` Comparative Behavioral Studies,'' `` The Decay of the Humane,'' and `` The Evolution of Thought.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most of Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>'s colleagues on a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel have spurned his invitation to join him on a six-nation tour, despite his promise that the taxpayer-paid trip will mix pleasure with business. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION>, has invited 17 panel members to accompany him to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for an `` on-the-scene evaluation of the changes which are occurring in several areas of significance to our nation's defense requirements.'' But <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>'s letter of invitation also notes other attractions in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. `` I also intend to make a special effort to allow time for visits to museums, art galleries, and religious and historical sites in the capitals and the countryside of these countries,'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> wrote. Citing protocol demands, he suggested that the senators bring along their spouses on `` what I know will be a most enjoyable and productive trip.'' `` Far from being a ` congressional junket,' this trip will take us to areas which I believe we need to visit to understand the dimensions of the problems confronting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security and to meet the responsibilities we face as members of the subcommittee on defense,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> obtained a copy of the letter, which proposes the trip for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s Easter vacation the last two weeks of March. Only Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, has definitely signed up, although three senators, <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa.; <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La; and <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, are undecided, according to an informal head count. The rest say they have no plans to go. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that he has declined because `` I took those trips when I was chairman'' of the subcommittee. The itinerary calls for three nights in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, two in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, three in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>. The route was designed to allow members to see `` fracture zones'' of the geopolitical world, said <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, whose subcommittee oversees spending for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. Along the way, the senators would share Easter services with American forces aboard a ship in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and review fundamental changes under way in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. The congressional party will fly on an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet `` to ensure that we accomplish the objectives of our trip and to add a measure of security,'' <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> said. The government picks up all expenses for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They receive daily per diem at the same rate as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats abroad. For example, the daily rate is $ 163 in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> and $ 98 in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. Congressional spouses travel free with their mates on military aircraft, but they must pay their own expenses. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official familiar with the trip, speaking on condition of anonymity, said arrangements such as the exact dates are not yet firm. In the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, foreign trips on behalf of a committee must be approved by the full committee chairman, while those on behalf of the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> must have the approval of the chamber's majority and minority leaders. <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> has yet to request formal approval of the trip from Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chairman of the appropriations committee, according to <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, the committee <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, also a member of the defense panel, will not accompany <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, `` plans to travel to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>; that's the only traveling he'll do in March.'' <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> wants to accompany <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON> because `` he's new on the committee and he wants to see all the installations,'' said his spokesman, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlein </PERSON>. At least 13 subcommittee members said they have no plans to go, most of them citing prior commitments and more pressing business at home. Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, is n't going in part because he does n't like being in a `` large delegation. ... He tends to prefer trips that are more focused,'' said his spokesman, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., declined because he recently returned from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, an aide said Senators have other plans for the recess, according to the members or their aides: <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn.; <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>,; <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis.; <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss

 <PERSON> Gena </PERSON> <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> might be legally insane. But if she takes the medication that calms her, she could be in prison for the rest of her life. The drug dilemma has kept the 25-year-old <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> shuttling between jail, mental institutions and courtrooms since Jan. 10, 1983, the day she allegedly strangled 21-year-old <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindoni </PERSON>, whose nude body was found in a bathtub. After <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> was charged in the slaying, she was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic and placed on antipsychotic medication. She was found competent to stand trial if she relied on such drugs. <PERSON> Spero </PERSON>, now a psychiatric patient at <ORGANIZATION> Medfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, is taking her lawyer's advice to refuse the drugs he calls a `` chemical straitjacket'' that would give her the equilibrium to face her accusers in court. Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Colella </PERSON> said that only without the drugs would a jury see her insanity unmasked, accurately reflecting his client's condition the day <PERSON> Sindoni </PERSON> was killed Several forensic psychiatrists questioned the ethics of <PERSON> Colella </PERSON>'s advice, including Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, who teaches at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> He called the medication <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> would take `` mind-restoring, not mind-altering'' and said he wondered about the welfare of such patients. `` I feel it's a bad investment on the part of any attorney who recommends this to a patient. ... Mental illness can be a very painful and troubling and extremely uncomfortable condition for many people,'' he said. In a recent interview, <PERSON> Colella </PERSON> said: `` They argue that if she's not yelling and screaming, therefore she's cured ... If the criminal charges were to go away, she would still be a person who should be committed because she's a danger to herself and society.'' <PERSON> Colella </PERSON> backs his legal tactic with a 1981 decision by the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that a psychiatric patient could refuse medication. District Attorney <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> disagrees with <PERSON> Colella </PERSON>, and persists in hoping a judge will find <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> competent to stand trial so he can try her for murder. But she ca n't be ordered to take antipsychotic drugs, and at her annual reviews for mental competency, a judge has continued hospitalization. `` It's in the best interest of justice to have this case tried,'' <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said. `` Either this is a case of murder, which we allege, or we have a defendant who would be found not guilty by reason of insanity. And the only way that will be resolved is through a trial.'' For three years, <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> was incarcerated at the state prison for women at <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> until a judge ordered her moved to <ORGANIZATION> Medfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> was a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION> when the killing occurred. <PERSON> Sindoni </PERSON> was attending <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The two women had been friends about seven months and had shared a house with other women in <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> for a time. <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> had a history of mental troubles and checked into psychiatric hospitals on several occasions, <PERSON> Colella </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Spero </PERSON>'s arms are scarred with self-inflicted razor cuts and cigarette burns, <PERSON> Collela </PERSON> said. She hears voices and hallucinates. Since her hospitalization at <LOCATION> Medfield </LOCATION>, doctors there said she also suffers from temporal lobe epilepsy, <PERSON> Colella </PERSON> said. Temporal lobe epilepsy, for which <PERSON> Spero </PERSON> takes medication, is a psychologically debilitating illness that can cause sufferers to become suddenly angry or to exhibit other erratic behavior. Such attacks themselves would justify a defense of innocent by reason of insanity, <PERSON> Colella </PERSON> said. But nobody knows the extent of <PERSON> Spero </PERSON>'s problems. Over the years, she has been diagnosed with a variety of mental illnesses. A week before the slaying she sought psychiatric treatment, but she left before being admitted to the center.

 The Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> will not appeal a judge's ruling that the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> may bar him from teaching <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> theology because of his dissenting views on sexual ethics. `` I have lost, but the university, its faculty and students may have lost more than I,'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said after <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> ruled in <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>'s favor on all issues raised by <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> in his landmark breach of contract lawsuit. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> judge said the school has the right to make its own decisions in its struggle to balance its commitment to academic freedom with obedience to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was strongly criticized by <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials for his positions on abortion, homosexuality and other matters of sexual ethics during more than two decades teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. `` The court's opinion confirms what the university itself has asserted in this case _ that full academic freedom, as understood in American higher education, does not now exist at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said. `` I have fought for academic freedom at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for more than 20 years,'' he said. `` I have lost. As far as I am concerned, this was the last battle.'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> maintained the university violated his contract when last April it stripped him of his canonical mission, which the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> requires to teach Catholic theology. That action came two years after the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> declared <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was no longer suitable or eligible to teach Catholic theology. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> contended that the canonical mission requirement had fallen into disuse when he began teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> in 1965. He said a 1981 church rule making them mandatory did n't apply to him because it was n't in effect when he joined the faculty. The judge ruled that <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> should have understood that his contract changed at that time, requiring him to maintain a canonical mission. <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> also said the CUA faculty handbook, which by <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> law constitutes a contract, does not specify that professors have full academic freedom. <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> said he feared the ruling would place limits on academic freedom in other Catholic universities in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But university officials said they felt vindicated. `` It does n't surprise me, to tell you the truth,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Byron </PERSON>, president of the university. `` This is really what I expected, because we never breached his contract. `` I regret that this ever came to litigation, but it's nice not to lose.'' <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, who remains a tenured professor at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> but can not teach there, has taught as a visiting professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and is currently at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> said the offer remains open for <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> to teach at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> if he will accept an alternative assignment.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Dip Since January, But Still Higher than Last Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 The Agriculture Department's preliminary figures for February show that prices farmers get for raw products declined 0.7 percent from their January average but still were 14 percent above a year ago. Lower prices for soybeans, lettuce, milk and corn were mostly responsible for the decline from January, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday Higher prices for tomatoes, strawberries, potatoes and hay partly offset the decline in the other commodities. `` Prices of food grains increased from January to February while feed grains and oilseed prices decreased,'' the report said. `` The all-wheat price moved to the highest level since April of 1981, but the average corn and soybean prices dropped from January to February.'' Tomato prices moved up sharply during the month, and the February average for cattle and calves was the highest since May 1979. The report also included revisions showing that prices received by farmers actually rose 2.8 percent from December to January instead of the 1.4 percent gain reported a month ago. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, that the farm economy as a whole `` is continuing to make real progress in recovering'' from the hard times of the early and mid-1980s. Last year's drought helped reduce supplies of major crops, including corn, soybeans and wheat, which has resulted in higher prices. `` The higher prices have helped maintain a high cash income level for those farmers with supplies to sell and for the sector as a whole,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` However,'' he added, `` the drought dealt a severe blow to many producers in drought areas who lost much of their crop and who did not have prior-year crops to sell. It also placed a heavy burden on livestock, poultry and dairy producers who were faced with higher feed costs.'' According to the preliminary February price figures, based mostly on midmonth averages, the index for livestock and livestock products as a group declined 0.6 percent from their January average but still were up 5.4 percent from February 1988. The department's all-crops price index for February was down 1.4 percent from January but averaged 27 percent above a year ago. No new price figures for farm production costs were included in the February report. Those have been confined to quarterly averages because of budget cutbacks. Although the projections are subject to change, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 48 billion to $ 52 billion this year, compared with a near-record of $ 57 billion in 1988. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Department economists say cash expenses are expected to rise moderately in 1989 with expanded crop acreages and costlier production items. Food prices in 1988 rose an average of about 3.7 percent, and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> analysts say another increase of 3 percent to 5 percent is likely in 1989.

 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end discrimination against blacks, Hispanics and women within the bureau will produce measurable results within a year, Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> says. `` I have made it clear throughout the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> _ not just to top management _ that all forms of discrimination are repulsive and will not be tolerated,'' Sessions told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary panel Tuesday. He told the subcommittee that he would fight not only hiring discrimination but racial harassment and a practice that Hispanic <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents say has repeatedly blocked them from advancement within the bureau. The Hispanics say they are often thrown into stopgap roles for which Spanish-speaking agents are needed and as a result miss out on in-depth investigative experience that leads to promotion. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, responsible for enforcing the nation's civil rights laws, has 8,723 special agents, of whom 419 are black, 453 are Hispanic, 119 are of Asian background and 40 are American Indians. Sessions told the panel that represents an increase of 27 black agents and 54 Hispanics since October 1987. Trainees not yet in the field are included, however, and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials were unable to say immediately how many employees have been added overall since 1987, thus leaving unclear the percentage increase in minorities if any, noted Rep. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>. `` We may have lost ground as far as agents in the field and may need to catch up,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> said `` We have a catch-up program,'' Sessions said. He said, however, that he would be able to present the lawmakers with measurable improvement over the current situation within a year. Discrimination suits against the bureau, one brought by 238 Hispanic agents, have resulted in disclosures of bias. Bureau recruiters have been barred from using the facilities at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> law school because of findings in the Hispanic agents' suit, although Sessions still plans to deliver the commencement address at the school this year. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are urging the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to settle the lawsuits quickly. `` They have in my opinion been embarrassing,'' said Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sensenbrenner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wis </LOCATION>. He urged Sessions to get `` these problems behind us because, in my opinion, we all have more important things to do.'' Sessions said he would increase the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Equal Employment Opportunity chief and give the official `` direct personal access to me upon request.'' If managers balk at proposed changes, he said, `` the <ORGANIZATION> EEO </ORGANIZATION> officer will be instructed to come directly to me.'' `` There will be no ambiguity about the role of this new office in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>,'' Sessions said. Problems in local offices should be directed to resident <ORGANIZATION> EEO </ORGANIZATION> counselors swiftly, Sessions said. He promised steps to make these counselors, some of whom have come under criticism, `` more responsive to the needs of their peers.''

<HEAD>Gulf Minesweeping Force Cut in Half</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has decided to call home three of the six mine-sweeping ships it deployed to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> during the height of fighting between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, defense sources say. The officials, who insisted on anonymity, said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> already had begun notifying friendly nations in the region of the decision. The Pentagon now expects the three minesweepers to depart the gulf by the middle of March, the sources added. `` The ships are being withdrawn because the threat has really lessened'' since a cease-fire took effect last August, said one ranking <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official. `` But we're not withdrawing all of them because there is still an occasional floater -LRB- underwater mine -RRB- out there. We're scaling back at what we deem a prudent pace.'' The decision to halve the number of minesweepers in the region comes as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> allies such as <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> are calling home their naval forces, and when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has stopped side-by-side escorts for convoys of oil tankers. It also comes as the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> debate a proposal to stop paying danger pay to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sailors working inside the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, and as <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> prepares to drop American registry for six of the 11 tankers that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had been protecting. `` We do n't see any of the real issues being settled between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in peace talks, but on the other hand we do n't see the truce breaking down, either,'' said one administration official. `` So everybody continues to scale back.'' In a related development, the four-star general who heads the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was attempting to curry greater favor with _ and influence over _ <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. `` There are signs that their relations are already improving,'' said Gen. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON>, the head of the command responsible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` It is important that we avoid a precipitous drawdown of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces that would send the wrong signal as regards the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> commitment to sustaining peace in the region,'' <PERSON> Schwarzkopf </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must not lessen interest in the region nor permit that perception to develop.'' The defense sources said Tuesday they expected the three minesweepers that would be recalled would be the ones deployed from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> _ the Esteem, Conquest and Enhance. The other three ships _ the Fearless, Inflict and Illusive _ traveled to the region from ports on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The Korean War-vintage craft were ordered to the gulf in the summer of 1987, shortly after the reflagged <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> tanker <LOCATION> Bridgeton </LOCATION> struck a mine while steaming in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> convoy. The ships did not arrive until November 1987, however, because they were towed across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> to hold down engine wear. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been criticized for its slow pace in replacing the aging minesweepers with a more capable, modern mine-sweeping vessel. But the six ships have found and neutralized a number of suspected Iranian mines. The administration of former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> agreed in the spring of 1987 to extend American military protection to 11 Kuwaiti tankers after they re-registered under the Stars and Stripes. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, a friend of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a key ally of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, had seen its ships become a special target of Iranian forces. After eight years of fighting, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> finally agreed to a truce last August and to date, the cease-fire has held.

<HEAD>City Negligence Ruling Called Middle-of-Road</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing cities to be sued for monetary damages in some cases is being called a moderate decision that will protect local treasuries against bankrupting negligence judgments. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Branham </PERSON>, a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who has studied the case, called Tuesday's ruling `` a moderate, middle-of-the-road approach.'' She said municipalities still have some protection `` because mere negligence will not suffice, but individuals are protected and on occasion can reach into a city treasury's deep pockets to recover for violations of their rights.'' The justices ruled unanimously that local governments may be forced to pay when their `` deliberate indifference'' lets inadequately trained employees violate someone's rights. But in a case from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the court set tough standards that are expected to head off a wave of successful lawsuits nationwide. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, writing for the court, said a city or town can not be held legally accountable when an inadequately trained public employee violates someone's rights unless the harm is directly linked to the city's deliberate indifference. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said creating any less-stringent standard of proof would open local governments to `` unprecedented liability'' and saddle federal courts with `` an endless exercise of second-guessing municipal employee-training programs.'' Past Supreme Court decisions make clear that a much-used federal civil rights law may not be invoked to sue a local government every time one of its employees violates someone's rights. The court previously had ruled that the local government is not liable unless the injury stemmed from some unconstitutional official policy. In Tuesday's ruling, the court for the first time said a local government's valid official policy may be challenged successfully _ if the policy is subverted by inadequate training. The decision is a setback, but not a final defeat, for <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> officials who sought to kill a lawsuit by a woman who says police violated her rights by failing to get needed medical attention while she was in their custody. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> sued <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> over an April 26, 1978, incident in which she was stopped for speeding while driving her teen-age daughter to school. The 52-year-old woman repeatedly slumped to the stationhouse floor during a stay of 30 or 40 minutes but police officers did not call for medical help, saying they believed Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was merely excited and would calm down if left alone and permitted to see her family. Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> later was diagnosed as suffering from stress reaction, anxiety and depression. She was hospitalized for a week, and received subsequent outpatient treatment for the next year. A jury awarded Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> $ 200,000 after deciding that she unreasonably had been denied medical attention by police. The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, although ordering a new trial in Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' case, ruled that <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> could be liable for monetary damages because its police officers were not trained adequately to summon medical help in such cases. The justices returned Mrs. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' case to the <ORGANIZATION> 6th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which can now order a new trial or dismiss the suit. In other decisions, the court: _ Ruled 6-3 that railroads and airlines may punish strikers by giving their jobs to employees with less seniority who stay on the job or return to work before the strike ends _ Voted 9-0 in a case involving two Canadian citizens with bank accounts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state to make it easier for the federal government to give tax information and financial records to a foreign government _ Reinstated a convicted <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> murderer's death sentence, ruling 5-4 that he should have been barred from mounting a successful constitutional attack in federal courts

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar firmed against the Japanese yen Wednesday, while share prices declined in active trading. The dollar opened at 126.97 yen, the day's low, and moved up to 127.81 yen at one point before closing at 127.68 yen, up 0.53 yen from Tuesday's close. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 300.17-point loser Tuesday, shed another 21.30 points, closing at 31,964.30. Traders attributed the comeback to an 8.03-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight and to correction of the previous day's loss, which they attributed to technical factors unrelated to economic news. Tuesday's loss in the Nikkei, the market's main barometer, was the biggest since Nov. 28, when it shed 380.27 points. The index had been reaching new highs in recent trading days. In foreign exchange trading, the dollar opened the day at 126.97 yen, down 0.18 yen from Tuesday's 127.15-yen finish. Dealers said the dollar strengthened because of high demand at the start of the new month.

<HEAD>Drought Looms Over California While Floods Threaten Ohio, Mississippi</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spring flooding is threatening the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basins and several areas along the Canadian border, while <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> basin face the possibility of more drought, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> reports. Spring snowmelt conditions were detailed Tuesday by the weather service in a report that agency scientist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON> said presented `` hydrological extremes'' in various parts of the nation. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> faces the most crucial test in the next couple of months with the possibility of a third consecutive dry summer for the first time in this century. On a national basis the potential for drought does n't appear as severe as last summer, said <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON>, `` but there are some areas that definitely bear watching.'' Meanwhile, portions of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and other southern states have already experienced flooding and have saturated soil that could pose a continuing danger in the runoff season. There also is potential for spring snowmelt flooding in northern <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON> said. In addition to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the spectre of drought hangs over the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> metropolitan areas and the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON>. He noted that some potential good news was included, with both the 30-day and 90-day weather outlooks indicating a chance for above-normal moisture in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But that is not a guarantee, and the mountain snowpack that provides most summer moisture to the Golden State is well below normal. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s reservoirs are already low, following two dry years, and in some parts of the state stream flow appears likely to fall to less than 20 percent of normal, he said. The weather over the next two months is critical, <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON> said, noting that by May the state enters a normally dry season. <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON>, the weather service's director of hydrology, rejected the suggestion that global `` greenhouse'' warming could be the cause of this dryness. He attributed the conditions to the regular variability of climate, as well as changes in the movement of the jet stream that steers storm systems in from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. In addition, he said, unusually cold water conditions in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> are likely having an effect in reducing <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s moisture. The second area of potential drought is the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where last summer's dryness lowered reservoir levels and damaged crops. `` A lot hangs in the balance of the next few months'' for this area also, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBouno </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>. He said the snow cover is about 84 percent of normal over the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, but it would take five years of normal moisture to refill reservoirs depleted by the recent drought. In addition, he noted that the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> is a major supplier of water to the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, so continued dry conditions could affect regions downstream. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> also was cited by <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON> as a major dry area, and the threat of water supply shortages also covers <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basin. On the other side of the coin, flooding already has occurred in the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> valleys, <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON> noted. The ground is saturated in those areas and spring snowmelt could result in further flooding problems. Major storms could lead to flooding in areas from east <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> eastward into the southern <LOCATION> Appalachian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> and north to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> valley </LOCATION>, he said. In addition, a heavy snowpack poses the potential for dangerous flooding in drainage areas around <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> westward through the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, Rainy, <LOCATION> Souris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basins. Flooding is also possible, but less likely, in the Adirondack region of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hudlow </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> wants to zero in on direct-mail groups that try to look like the government and sound like the government in order to get consumers to open their checkbooks. Private fund-raising appeals made to look as if they are from government agencies are among the biggest consumer complaints inadequately addressed by current law, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Swagerty </PERSON>, assistant chief postal inspector for criminal investigations, told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs subcommittee Tuesday. <PERSON> Swagerty </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> at a hearing that he endorsed legislation introduced by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., requiring eye-catching `` look-alike'' mail to carry a clear notice on the envelope disclaiming any connection with the federal The bill would deal with ads such as those that appear to come from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mint, from agencies offering surplus property or from the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offering `` some inside track for obtaining mining rights in public lands,'' <PERSON> Swagerty </PERSON> said. Currently, the Postal Service can do little to stop thousands of pieces of mail it finds deceptive. For example, a private group's fund-raising appeal that said `` important <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request enclosed'' was not deemed illegal because the contents showed that it was not actually from the government, said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahoney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Under the proposed legislation, the envelope _ as well as the contents _ would require a notice that it is a private solicitation. Under penalty of fines, the bill would require a similar disclaimer for envelopes with official-looking seals or colors and for organizations with important-sounding names such as the `` Federal Record Service.'' The record service sent letters `` worded to intimidate unsuspecting parents into believing they must obtain a Social Security number for their newborn child,'' Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., told the panel He said the group charged $ 10, even though anyone can get a number from the government at no charge. An entity called the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> sponsored a $ 50,000 sweepstakes, prompting a confused constituent to ask <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> when the government got into the `` gambling business.''

The Lebanese passenger and Jordanian flight attendant are among four witnesses who have so far identified <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> as the leader of five heavily armed men who stormed aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airliner </ORGANIZATION> on June 11, 1985, and held about 70 passengers and crew members hostage for 30 hours. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> instructed courtroom artists not to sketch the two witnesses as they testified Tuesday. Two American passengers also have identified hijackers, who took control of the airplane in an effort to publicize their efforts to force Palestinian refugees to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, 30, has pleaded innocent to a six-count sky piracy indictment. The trial in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is a test of a 1984 law in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> asserts `` long-arm'' jurisdiction over cases involving Americans taken hostage overseas. The protection given the witnesses and their families shows the lengths to which the government has gone to bring <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> to trial, beginning with his dramatic capture on a boat near <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> two years after the hijacking. One of the protected witnesses, <PERSON> Mouin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ajam </PERSON>, 24, said he originally went to jail for five days rather than testify. `` I was concerned about the danger to my parents,'' said <PERSON> Ajam </PERSON>, a Lebanese who was one of the passengers. <PERSON> Ajam </PERSON>, his wife and their infant son are living under new identities at an undisclosed location. Flight attendant <PERSON> Sawson </PERSON> <PERSON> Odetalleh </PERSON>, 22, testified that federal authorities had moved her, her mother, sister, brother-in-law and five nieces and nephews to this country under new names to guard them against revenge. `` If I would come out to testify in the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>, I would be sure 100 percent that it would jeopardize my family,'' the Jordanian native said. Miss <PERSON> Odetalleh </PERSON> testified that shortly after the hijackers rushed onto the aircraft, one demanded that she identify plainclothes Jordanian security guards on board and asked a colleague to hand him a knife. `` If you do n't show me the marshals, I will cut your fingers and make your face ugly,'' she testified that the hijacker, not <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, told her. Later, the same hijacker approached her with two hand grenades, Miss Odetalleh testified. `` This one will kill you, this one will burn you. Which do you want?'' she quoted him saying. At another point, the same hijacker placed her between himself and a window, explaining that he wanted a shield in case snipers started firing, and also wrote his nickname on her leg with a pen. Defense counsel <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> tried to show that <PERSON> Ajam </PERSON> and Miss <PERSON> Odetalleh </PERSON> benefited from their agreements to testify against <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>. But they argued that they had sacrificed important parts of their lives in order to testify. `` We ca n't see my parents, they ca n't visit us. They ca n't know where we are. That's hard for the mothers,'' <PERSON> Ajam </PERSON> testified. `` I left my memories. I left my language,'' said Miss Odetalleh. `` It is hard to be in the witness program ... You start from zero.'' More than two years after the hijacking, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was lured on Sept. 13, 1987, to a sailboat and arrested in international waters 13 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, testified <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who led the team of a dozen <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents aboard the boat. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was interrogated for four days aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> munitions ship USS Butte and then flown to <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> testified. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> sought to convince the jury that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> coerced a confession from <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, who was seasick and suffering from two broken wrists after his arrest.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 front cargo door that may have popped open during a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' flight, sending nine passengers to their deaths, had a recent history of problems, federal investigators said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had tracked a falling object it believed to be the cargo door on radar to a point 86 miles south-southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>, where the ocean is 16,800 feet deep. The cargo door would be `` very helpful to us in our analysis,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said at a late-night briefing, although he did not know whether an attempt would be made to retrieve it. Meanwhile, a similar <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet scheduled to land Tuesday in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, was delayed 18 hours because of a faulty rear cargo door, the airline said. While the repair took only a short time, it extended the allowable working time for the flight crew beyond the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION> limit, so the flight was delayed until a rested crew was available, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The forward cargo door on the 18-year-old 747 that ripped open at 22,000 feet after leaving here for <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, on Friday had electrical problems more than once in December and had to be closed manually, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. A seal on the same door was repaired in January, he said. At an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> news briefing Monday night, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> would not characterize the seriousness of the problems that were found by <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators by checking the aircraft's maintenance records. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said the electrical problems are not considered serious and were on a list of deferred items that do not affect the airworthiness of the plane. `` That's a list that includes things like a reading light not working,'' he said. As for the faulty door seal, it is something that would be fixed before the plane was allowed to fly, he said. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Bobbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mardis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where the maintenance records are kept, said the recent cargo door repairs were not listed on the jet's service difficulty report, possibly because they were minor or were completed recently and had not yet been logged. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records show that two other airlines reported faulty <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 cargo doors in the past five years. One was on a Pan American 747 that departed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in March 1987. The airliner returned to the airport after the crew was unable to pressurize the cabin following takeoff, according to the records. A worn part on a cargo door latch was blamed for the problem. In the other case, the rear cargo door warning light blinked on a <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 747 during departure from <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in December 1983. Ice on a master lock pin was the cause, investigators said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jet's cockpit voice recorder indicates that the pilot, Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, had no warning before the plane rapidly decompressed, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. On the recording, the cockpit crew discussed only emergency procedures after the accident, not a possible cause or warning, he said. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> managed to turn the plane around and land safely in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on only two of the four engines. For <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, 59, the ill-fated Flight 811 was to be his next-to-last before retirement, according to his daughter, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg-Smith </PERSON>, who lives on the island of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>, a 34-year veteran pilot with <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, told his daughter that he credits `` the Heavenly Father watching over him.'' `` That's one of the first things he told me when I first talked to him,'' she said. United has refused to allow <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> and the other 17 crewmembers of Flight 811 to talk publicly about the flight, although he is expected to participate in a news conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on Thursday. Of the 354 people aboard the plane, 27 were treated at hospitals, mostly for minor injuries caused by flying debris. Two remained hospitalized Tuesday, both <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> crewmembers. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, aviation industry and government safety experts recommended Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> require $ 800 million worth of mandatory work on older airliners to ensure safety of the nation's aging airliner fleet. The unprecedented program would affect more than 1,300 early <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, 737 and 727 models at a cost of over $ 600,000 each. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s Flight 812 from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, which was delayed because of a rear cargo door problem, was scheduled to arrive in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> at 1:10 a.m. Tuesday, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s reservations desk. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> said engineers replaced a safety pin in the cargo door as a precaution in line with a company order to check all of the airline's aircraft. The federal investigation of Flight 811 has focused on the cargo door latching mechanism, and airlines around the world took <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s advice and checked the cargo doors of their 747s. `` What this is from us is by no means interfering or speculating on the probable cause of the accident,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiminez </PERSON> said Monday. `` It's more of a prudent act on our part to keep customers appraised of what we know.'' <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> issued a statement that more than 900 cargo doors in a fleet of 399 operational aircraft were inspected, and seven repairs were required. <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said no repair was urgent and all would have been performed in normal maintenance.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says he's not bothered by the row over the Chinese dissident who could n't come to dinner and says he wo n't clear such social invitations in advance with the country hosting his visit. Discussing the communist government's decision to bar astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> from attending a dinner he hosted in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s capital city last weekend, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped that people would n't make too much over the incident. `` That's not the whole question when it comes to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' commitment to human rights,'' the president said during a photo session while meeting with members of his Cabinet. Asked whether the flap could have been averted if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had notified the communist government in advance of those invited to the Texas-style barbecue at the <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> hotel _ as the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> have suggested _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` They may have a point, that it might have been avoided.'' But when asked if he would tell a communist host government ahead of time about invitations to dissidents, he replied, `` No, and I think they understand that.'' Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advocacy of human rights during the two-day visit to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> but acknowledged `` there is some degree of difference'' between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handling of the issue and the way former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> dealt with it. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> met with dissidents during his visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1988, and the former president often gave human rights a high profile during his public statements in foreign settings. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes he should push human rights in talks with communist leaders but that it should not be pursued to the exclusion of other concerns. Questions have been raised about how much emphasis <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will devote to human rights in the wake of the flap over <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose to voice his complaint _ quietly _ to Chinese Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuequian </PERSON> on Monday, the day after Chinese police barred <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, 52, from attending the event. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` does feel that there are any number of ways to call attention to our human rights policy, but to make the views known diplomatically in a quiet way that does not disrupt or infringe on many of the other objectives that need to be raised with these countries.'' `` So there is some degree of difference there,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` but I'll let you define'' it. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s invitation to <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and a handful of other dissidents was intended to make a human rights statement, and said that the president had pushed the issue `` in any number of ways.'' `` I suppose maybe the proof is in the pudding, in the sense that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> today is saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to blame for the diplomatic row,'' he said. `` Which is true. ... Which is to say that the president invited dissidents to this banquet for a reason.'' Four other dissidents attended the banquet, but kept a low profile there.

After almost two hours with the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said, `` I do n't see anything, as a result of this meeting, detrimental or negative.'' The senior Republican on the committee, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, said the nominee was `` healthy and handles himself well.'' But the chairman, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., declined comment The department is being formed on March 15 by elevation of the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to Cabinet status. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> has been nominated for both the jobs of administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> and the secretary of the department. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> was undersecretary of state for security assistance, science and technology when President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose him in January to handle the veterans department. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> also served 12 terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday's session went over a 1977 episode in which <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> tipped off the Korean embassy that an agent of the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> was about to defect to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> at the time was a member of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee investigating the `` Koreagate'' scandal _ bribes by the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ensure their support. The agent, <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, was spirited away from his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> home by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents just a half-hour before colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> arrived. After his testimony, he received a new identity in the government's protected witness program. In 1978, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> denied being the source of the tip and declined to testify before a grand jury. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> did not pursue the matter, saying that doing so would compromise intelligence sources and methods. But in 1983, appearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for confirmation as counselor to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> admitted being the tipster. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> said he did not realize there was any danger to the agent, whom he did not identify to the embassy. The committee was to cover the same ground in public this afternoon.

<TEXT>
 Premier was a cigarette designed for people who hate cigarettes: a butt that did n't cause cancer, that did n't cloud the air with smoke, that did n't even dribble ashes. It also did n't taste very good. And that apparently is what made the planned billion dollar project go up in smoke. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced that after five months of test marketing in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, it had snuffed out Premier because it `` has not achieved adequate consumer acceptance.'' During its short life, Premier neither satisfied cigarette smokers nor placated cigarette haters. Despite its label, it was not exactly smokeless. It gave off a steamy vapor reminiscent of cigarette smoke. It was a clever bit of engineering, so high-tech that it was probably the first cigarette to come with instructions on how to smoke it. Its advantages seemed impressive. It produced almost no tar, so it probably did not cause lung cancer. And no smoke curled off its lighted tip, so non-smokers were less likely to become upset. But like many compromises, this one seemed to please nobody. To smokers, it did not taste, feel or look enough like a real cigarette. And to doctors who worry about smoking's effects, this one was still a coffin nail because it almost certainly would have caused heart disease. Smokers who tried it complained it was hard to light, it went out, it did not burn down like a normal cigarette and it was hot to hold. But worst of all was the flavor. `` People smoke for taste. It's very bland, and you have to draw until you get a headache to get any taste out of it at all,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinstead </PERSON>, tobacco buyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Save chain in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. `` I thought the project initially was revolutionary in concept,'' said analyst <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` But the technology was n't there yet to satisfy consumer requirements.'' Reynolds maintained that people needed to smoke two or three packs to develop a taste for Premier. But instead, retailers said smokers often bought a pack, smoked one or two, passed around the rest and never came back for more. Doctors noted that even though Premier lacked cancer-causing tar, it delivered nicotine and carbon monoxide like other cigarettes. Those things cause heart disease, which is an even bigger smoking hazard than lung cancer. `` Given the fact that more people die from cardiovascular disease associated with smoking than from cancer, it's like comparing jumping from the 10th floor of a building with jumping from the seventh floor,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> for Nonsmoking and Health. Dr. <PERSON> Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a long-time opponent of cigarettes and member of a panel that reviewed <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' scientific data on Premier, said the product represented `` some progress for those who can not be turned off smoking.'' While Premier clearly seemed aimed at answering some of the major health complaints about cigarettes, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> never actually made any health claims. Instead, the brochure that came with a pack called it `` the cleaner smoke'' and said it reduced many of the `` controversial compounds'' found in ordinary cigarette smoke. In fact, <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> could not flatly state that the new cigarette was safer. That would have been an admission that regular cigarettes are unsafe, something the tobacco industry has never acknowledged. Here's how Premier worked: Instead of packed tobacco, the end of the cigarette contained a round piece of charcoal. Behind the charcoal was an inch-and-a-quarter long hollow aluminum capsule surrounded by tobacco. Inside the capsule were tiny beads containing dried tobacco, glycerin and two secret flavorings. When the smoker lit up and took a drag, he sucked hot air through the metal capsule. The heat vaporized the glycerin and nicotine in the dried tobacco as well as the flavorings. The vapor then passed through two filters and into the smoker's mouth. Analysts estimated the company spent about $ 325 million to develop and test market Premier, and <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> had said a full nationwide launch would have raised the cost to $ 1 billion. Several analysts speculated that the timing of Premier's demise was due to the recent buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which needs to cut costs at <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> to pay off the debt it took on in the record $ 24.53 billion takeover. But others said Premier was doomed no matter what. `` I think the consumer reaction was so negative that it pretty much was a foregone conclusion,'' <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Tough Clean-Air Bill Promised by July 4</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Senate clean air supporters have promised to write a tough, new anti-pollution bill by July 4, an announcement made while environmental experts were telling a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel that healthy adults and children are now at risk from dirty air. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee was told Tuesday that the nation faces a health emergency, with 150 million Americans now living in areas with unsafe levels of ozone and carbon monoxide. Dr. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Landrigan </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said children are especially vulnerable to air pollution because their airways are more narrow than those of adults, and because of their increased frequency of respiratory infections. He said studies of children in summer camps show those exposed to ozone at concentrations even below current allowable levels developed temporary respiratory problems. `` Children's often high levels of activity put them at risk for acute respiratory effects due to ozone exposure,'' <PERSON> Landrigan </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Godar </PERSON>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Americans mistakenly `` accept dirty air as one of the facts of life.'' `` Ozone can cause immediate, short-term changes in lung function and increased respiratory symptoms in healthy adults and children who exercise moderately or heavily during periods of elevated ozone concentrations,'' he said. `` Significant decreases in lung function and symptoms such as coughing and pain ... are experienced by exercising individuals exposed to ozone for one to two hours at levels comparable to those frequently found'' in unsafe air quality areas, he said. Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., who will sponsor the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s clean air bill this year, announced that sections of the legislation will be introduced at these time intervals: toxic air pollutants, April 3; new air quality standards, including controls on auto emissions, May 1, and acid rain control, June 1 He said a complete bill should be written before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' July 4 recess. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, sponsor of clean air legislation that died last year, told senators, `` Americans are suffering from a manmade phenomenon that can be controlled. We have developed the technologies of control. We have the resources to apply those technologies. Until now, we have lacked the political will to do so. We must now develop that will.'' Clean air legislation has been stalled for a decade, as supporters of industry and environmental groups _ and different regions of the country _ have fought to a standstill. Only one witness at the House hearing, representing <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, said that there was no conclusive evidence that current air quality levels caused lasting health problems. The chief of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, said the potential health effects from exposure to current levels of ozone and carbon monoxide `` have been the subject of considerable overstatement.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said 62 areas have failed to meet air quality standards for ozone and 59 for carbon monoxide, a list based on readings from 1985 to 1987. The list does not yet include 28 cities that exceeded the safe ozone levels last summer, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> data.

 In lobbying senators to support <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> for secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has the difficult task of overcoming the reputation Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has built over the past 16 years as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s bipartisan leader on defense issues. `` That's probably the toughest single obstacle the president faces,'' Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va., said Tuesday <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Democrat who has been chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> since 1986 and a member of the panel since 1973, led the committee's Democrats in a 11-9 party-line vote last week to reject the Tower nomination. Since then, he has made the case against Tower on national television, in private meetings with other senators and in the written report of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. But he insisted Tuesday that he has not been `` strong-arming anybody'' to vote against Tower. `` I'm not saying my prestige is on the line,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who has been described by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> as `` one of _ if not the most _ respected'' members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` I give them my views and I do n't make any bones about where I stand,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` But I'm not asking them to vote on anything other than their conscience.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s views are that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower provides evidence of a `` clear pattern of alcohol abuse'' and that the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's recent work as a high-paid consultant to defense contractors raises serious conflict-of-interest questions. Those views carry substantial weight, primarily because of <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s reputation among both Democrats and Republicans as a senator who does his homework and who speaks with authority on defense issues `` I have never known him to do anything in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that would appear to have self-serving, narrow political implications when dealing with national defense or foreign policy,'' former <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, a conservative Republican who served on the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with both <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and Tower, said he supports Tower for secretary of defense but, unlike some Republicans, does not believe <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>'s opposition is motivated by partisan politics. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> has resisted Republican efforts to paint the Tower nomination as a partisan fight waged by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to weaken the new president. `` The Republicans, if you agree with them, they say you're a patriot, but if you disagree, all of a sudden it's partisan,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, who during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years consistently ranked as one of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s top Democratic supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he realized when Tower was nominated that he would be subjected as committee chairman to a barrage of criticism, regardless of whether he supported or opposed the nomination. `` Either I would be the scapegoat because I was taking on the president, or I would be the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> covering up the alleged transgressions of the nominee,'' he said. The criticism intensified Tuesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reprinted a Dec. 4, 1972, article from The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> detailing an Oct. 31, 1964, automobile accident in which <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident. In an accompanying article, the newspaper said: `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is entitled to pass judgment on <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s personal history, then the public is also entitled to know the salient facts about those who judge Mr. Tower.'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> acknowledged that his `` driving and judgment were impaired'' on the evening of the accident because he had too much to drink. But he said an accident 24 years ago is not relevant to the Tower nomination. `` The implication is that if I have an automobile accident in 1964, then I'm not qualified under the Constitution to render advice and consent in 1989,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think that logic holds.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Commodity Programs Likely Budget Target</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> says he is still looking for areas to reduce his budget by $ 1.1 billion, but believes most of the money will come from commodity programs. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called for the reduction, but not specified which programs should be cut, leaving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with only <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration proposals. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> assured the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday he was not wedded to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposals. For example, he said ground water and food programs cut in the proposed <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget will be restored. He said <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> programs and those of the <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, however, will be reduced along with commodities. After the hearing, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told reporters that cuts in commodities would n't be arbitrary. `` We have to go through a sophisticated analysis to determine the extent of the changes. It may vary from commodity to commodity,'' he said. `` We have to decide the best way to achieve the reduction while still keeping a safety net for farmers. It's not an easy trick,'' he said. He mentioned cutting target prices, but said they may not be cut by the same percentage for every commodity. He also suggested that there may be a reduction in permitted acreage. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told committee members who asked specifically about the school lunch program that it was unlikely to see any reduction, though President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had suggested it be cut by $ 950 million. The secretary said he wanted to evaluate it and all nutrition programs run by the department, but he doubted that there would be any cuts in them. Rep. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Kildee </PERSON>, D-Mich., gave <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> a list of programs for low-income Americans which he said the committee over the years has agreed must never be cut, including school lunch and other child nutrition programs An area <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said should get more money is the Export Enhancement Program. `` Export expansion and long-term market development are of key importance to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agriculture,'' he told the committee. Discussing the ongoing negotiations under the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, known as <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is still committed to removing trade barriers worldwide. But he said the difficulty in achieving that end was demonstrated at the midterm review of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round last December in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was unable to get other countries to go along with its desire to do away with government subsidies. Following a meeting with <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> on Monday, Australian trade chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had softened its position, and `` put the ball very much in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s court.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said after the hearing Tuesday that <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> was correct in saying that the ball was in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION>, but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not softened. `` We formulated our proposal in a more palatable way,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. Trade talks resume in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has scrapped a planned trip to his family retreat in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> this month because of an impending birth in the First Family. `` You just do n't travel those last few days,'' insisted First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said she told the president to forget about plans for a pre-Easter visit to <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. And that was that. The family dog, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON>, or `` Millie,'' an English springer spaniel, is expecting _ and due sometime between March 15 and 20. While awaiting the new canine arrival, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says she plans to ride around the White House grounds on one of the two new `` Flying Pigeon'' bicycles that she and the president were presented during their visit last week to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It's the same kind of bike that she and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used to ride in the mid-1970s when they lived in the Chinese capital, where cars are few and most people get around on bikes. The president was head of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission there from 1974-75. The oval on the South Lawn of the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is exactly one quarter mile, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. She said it was a good place to use the new bicycle. When they were presented with the gift bikes, Chinese Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> suggested that that the Bushes ride the bikes around the White House grounds. The president, who gave <PERSON> Li </PERSON> a pair of black <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> boots in return, said he and Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would probably ride the bicycles in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> indicated that the boots, boasting flags of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, probably would not get as much of a workout. He said it was n't a custom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to go around with boots bearing flags, but he might wear them if he ever visited the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 When the president went on Chinese television earlier this week, he became the first foreign leader ever to do so.

 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> defends his decision to fight inflation with higher interest rates even though the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration disagrees with the central bank's reading of the economy <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that the current inflation rate is not `` doing clear, significant, corrosive harm to the economy at the moment.'' `` But it has built into it the seeds of an acceleration that if not dampened ... can become very damaging,'' he said in his first public statement since the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> escalated its anti-inflation fight Friday by increasing a key bank lending rate. He said the central bank expects inflation to increase this year to the 4.5 percent to 5 percent range, up about half a percentage point from last year. However, <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policy makers are worried that a pickup in wage increases and rising material costs will cause businesses and consumers to include the expectation of inflation in their plans. When that happens, prices will rise faster, he said. `` Our basic goal is to make sure that inflation does not accelerate inordinately and ultimately phases down,'' he said. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, in testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, softened previous criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tightening, but he did not retract his statement that the administration sees less danger of inflation. `` It's two people looking at the same statistic and coming to a slightly different conclusion,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, while not explicitly acknowledging the administration's comments, said in response to a question from Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., `` I think I get it from all sides. In the budget committee, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., and Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Neb </LOCATION>., praised the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> for its stance toward inflation, but Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., told <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, `` I'm afraid you're laying the seeds for Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of gradual increases in interest rates would not work and that `` far more ratcheting down'' of the economy will be needed to achieve the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s stated goal of zero inflation. `` You've got to almost create a self-fulfilling prophecy and create a recession,'' he said. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, all said that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration can help the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> curb inflation and also permit interest rates to drop by agreeing on a credible plan to cut the budget deficit. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget, if adopted, would trigger lower interest rates even if it eventually produced a deficit higher than the $ 100 billion Gramm-Rudman target for 1990. `` I may say I would like to see Gramm-Rudman-Hollings targets met literally -LRB- but -RRB- I do n't think that is required to bring a significant reduction in interest rates,'' he said. `` If, after the fact, the real number is $ 110 billion or $ 120 billion, in that vein, I would think that would be a major improvement which the markets would take very positively,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> chairman said. But, the reduction from the 1989 deficit of about $ 165 billion must not be accomplished with accounting tricks and must hold out the reasonable prospect for further reductions, he said. `` What can not have a positive effect is finding some set of bookkeeping gimmicks which largely meet Gramm-Rudman for fiscal 1990 and then paper over ` 91, ` 92, ` 93,'' he said.

<HEAD>Agency Says Food Supply Safe from Cancer-Causing Fungus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government confirms the drought helped increase the cancer-causing fungus aflatoxin in the 1988 corn crop in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, requiring some corn to be diverted to feed non-dairy cattle. But the government disputed concerns raised in a report by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> last week that aflatoxin-tainted corn is moving through the nation's food chain because of inadequate sampling and unreliable testing. In a statement Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the agency `` does not believe such concern is warranted because there is plenty of aflatoxin-free corn available for human consumption, and several layers of protection are in place.'' Aflatoxin is linked to the development of liver cancer in laboratory rats. Last year's heat and drought provided ideal conditions for development of the fungus that produces aflatoxin. Primary concern has centered around possible contamination of the milk and corn supply. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the agency reaffirmed to state health officials last fall its aflatoxin limit of 0.5 parts per billion for milk. States and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipments </ORGANIZATION>, which has prime responsibility for testing milk, expanded monitoring and as a result some milk in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> had higher levels of aflatoxin than allowed and had to be dumped, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The level of aflatoxin allowed in corn is 20 parts per billion, and about 6 percent _ 95 samples out of 1,650 _ of the field corn tested in recent months had higher levels, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. This corn can not be used for human consumption but can be diverted to feed non-dairy cattle, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> testing, which is concentrated in high risk areas, tests are conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the states, manufacturers and millers who buy corn for food products. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also tested about 100 corn products on store shelves _ including cooked cereal, dry cereal, tortillas, corn chips and popcorn _ and all were negative, agency spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigg </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> tested about 263 samples of corn flour and corn meal and found 2 percent, or six samples, to have more than 20 parts of aflatoxin per billion. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> policy requires that these products be removed from the market.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Leroy </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubeck </PERSON> hopes that giant ants and man-eating plants will soon invade the nation's classrooms. But the physics professor insists he's no mad scientist bent on revenge: His only gripe is ignorance. With international comparisons showing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students dead last in scientific knowledge, the <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor believes <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> youngsters might profit from spending some classroom time studying science fiction film thrillers. `` The purpose is to tell kids that this thing called science can be fun, and it can help me understand the world around me,'' said <PERSON> Dubeck </PERSON> in a telephone interview. He has published a 185-page curriculum, `` Science in Cinema: Teaching Science Fact Through Science Fiction Films,'' consisting of lesson plans exploring the scientific truths and falsehoods in 10 sci-fi films that <PERSON> Dubeck </PERSON> and co-authors <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moshier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boss </PERSON> say have proven excellent for teaching science. The curriculum, published by <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was field tested in a dozen <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> area schools in 1987-88. Test results of the 398 students exposed to the sci-fi curriculum showed that youngsters came away with a better understanding of scientific process and felt more positive about science. `` The greatest impact was on attitudes,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, professor of science education at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> who conducted the testing. `` Children are turning off to science in droves. This curriculum could retard that, although in and of itself it probably ca n't reverse it. Films in the curriculum were selected for their cinematic quality, their availability on videocassettes, and their ability to trigger discussions of scientific issues. For example, the immensely popular `` Star Wars'' is n't much good for teaching science. `` Too much of it is fantasy,'' said <PERSON> Dubeck </PERSON>. `` It gets all hung up with reincarnation, and ` the force.''' But students can get a new twist on astronomy and physics from `` Forbidden Planet,'' the 1956 classic. Can a spaceship possibly travel faster than the speed of light? Where does <PERSON> Robby </PERSON> the Robot get his incredible energy? `` The Andromeda Strain,'' a 1970 film about a killer microbe from outer space, could generate discussions about the problems scientists are having in conquering AIDS. Students can learn about plant life from `` The Day of the Triffids,'' a 1963 British offering featuring man-eating mutant plants from outer space. And `` Them!'' a chilling 1954 film about a world of giant ants, depicts accurately the habits of real ants and can get students talking about whether radiation could possibly create such mammoth mutations. Other films in the curriculum included `` The Day the Earth Caught Fire,'' `` Destination Moon,'' `` When Worlds Collide,'' `` The Day the Earth Stood Still,'' `` Five Million Years to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' and `` Colossus: The Forbin Project.'' <PERSON> Dubeck </PERSON>, a science fiction buff who owns copies of more than 250 such films, has taught a course on `` Science, Science Fiction and Film'' at Temple since 1977, and thought the idea might work for high school students as well. With $ 162,000 in grants from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the new curriculum was tried in 13 Philadelphia-area public and parochial high schools and one middle school last year. <PERSON> Dubeck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Moshier </PERSON>, a professor of biology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION>, trained 24 high school science teachers to use the curriculum during the summer of 1987. Multiple choice exams at the beginning and end of the school year showed that 80 percent of the 398 students in classes using science fiction films outscored 373 students in ordinary classes in science knowledge, knowledge of scientific process, and in attitudes toward science careers. Classes using the curriculum saw four to six films during the year, mixed in with traditional science education. In no case did the films and accompanying discussions take up more than 5 percent of total class time, <PERSON> Dubeck </PERSON> said. Perhaps above all, wrote <PERSON> Dubeck </PERSON>, many science fiction films depict science as solving problems, rather than causing them. Students often perceive chemistry simply as the cause of pollution, and physics connotes the risk of nuclear accidents. `` If science seems to many to have failed in the real world,'' he wrote, `` it still offers hope and fulfillment of dreams in science fiction.''

<TEXT>
 Drug use among high school seniors is declining, even though more than half of all students still had used an illegal drug at least once, according to a new report. `` The news is very encouraging,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schuster </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored the study. `` But we do n't want to imply that the war is won.'' `` The problem is there are still pockets, primarily among those who have dropped out of high school, where drug use remains at very high levels,'' he said. Some 16,300 high school seniors from 135 schools nationwide were polled in the survey. The survey, which has been conducted every year since 1975, found that the share of high school seniors who reported having ever used an illegal drug dropped from 56.6 percent in 1987 to 53.9 percent in 1988. That's the lowest level recorded since the survey began, when the rate was 55.2 percent. Peak illegal drug use occurred in 1981, when 65.6 percent of seniors reported having indulged at least once, according to the survey. The proportion of seniors who reported using an illegal drug within the previous year dropped from 41.7 percent in 1987 to 38.5 percent in 1988, and the percentage reporting use within the previous 30 days dropped from 24.7 percent to 21.3 percent in the same period, the survey showed.

<NOTE>Connaught Laboratories Recalls 46,000 Vials of DTP Vaccine</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Connaught Laboratories of <LOCATION> Swiftwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, has recalled 46,000 vials of DTP vaccine as a precautionary measure because of a labeling error, the company and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. DTP vaccine is used routinely to immunize infants and children against diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough. The recall was begun because four vials of equine influenza, found in a plant warehouse, were mislabeled as DTP vaccine. Equine influenza vaccine is used in immunizing horses against several strains of flu. As a safety precaution, the company notified 1,865 customers to return all vials with the lot number 8M91039. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said less than 20,000 of the 46,000 vials in the lot were actually shipped to doctors, pharmacists and distributors nationwide. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, in a statement, said the labeling error is not believed to constitute a health hazard because Connaught officials believe they have located the only mislabeled vials. `` Parents should not be unduly alarmed, nor should they interrupt their children's immunization schedules, but we feel that the action of the company to recall the marketed vaccine is prudent,'' Dr. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>, who has snipped at <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> and others, is at it again, this time firing a rocket at fellow `` Today'' show staffers such as <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalit </PERSON>. In a 6-month-old memo made public by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Newsday </LOCATION> on Tuesday, he accused weatherman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of holding <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s top-rated morning talk `` hostage'' to his `` bad taste.'' He said consumer advocate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> is a `` walking cliche.'' He said <PERSON> Shalit </PERSON>'s movie reviews are often too late and his interviews `` not very good.'' Medical correspondent <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulene </PERSON>'s theme weeks were dubbed `` boring,'' and many of New York-based consumer correspondent <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Furness </PERSON>' reports `` too local.'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> escaped mention. Her co-host, who wrote the memo last August when he was negotiating his three-year, $ 7 million contract, could not be reached for comment Tuesday because he was on vacation. It's not the first time <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>'s grumbles have made news. In a September issue of Sports Illustrated, he recounted his disenchantment with <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, among others. Even <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON>, who keeps a scrupulously happy face, seemed exasperated by <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>'s long-time war of words with the host of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night,'' which stemmed from <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s bullhorn disruption of a prime-time `` Today'' special. During an interview with <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice,'' <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> shouted from an upper floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> building, `` I'm <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, and I'm not wearing pants! <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s producer later confirmed that the bit had been arranged, though not cleared with the `` Today'' stars. <PERSON> Pauley </PERSON> said even she was n't angry at <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, and she was the one doing the interview when the disruption occurred, not <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>. That did n't keep <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> from launching and continuing a feud with <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> that escalated to the point of <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> questioning <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s manhood, during a news conference last summer. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> has since said the feud is a joke, but anyone who's seen <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> discuss the matter would be hard to convince. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was the target of <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>'s toughest jabs. `` This guy is killing us and no one's even trying to rein him in,'' <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> complained, and suggested `` nuking'' the assistant who supplies <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> with viewers' birthdates for <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s birthday greetings to centenarians. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON>'s comments `` old stuff.'' `` It's all water over the dam,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think he's a happy man We're all here to have fun and make money.'' <PERSON> Shalit </PERSON> said: `` I love what I do and I'm proud of my work. People always have something to say in any creative organization. It does n't bother me. Besides, I think <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> is a terrific guy.'' <PERSON> Furness </PERSON> said she reports only on stories that are of national interest. <PERSON> Ulene </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> is a smart guy about television, though he apparently does n't understand the importance to viewers of, say, Cholesterol Week. <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON> said he stands on his record. <PERSON> Gumbel </PERSON> also griped to executive producer <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> about <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s alleged `` lack of guidance and a lack of willingness to stand on folks and make sure they do what's necessary. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who was the recipient of the memo, told <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> it was `` stolen'' out of a computer file and that `` <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> and I always have candid exchanges about the show.'' NBC News President <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> declined to comment, but was supportive of <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> in his regular, weekly interoffice newsletter to the staff. <PERSON> Gartner </PERSON> has his share of negative press coming. An article in March's <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, inc. magazine, due on newsstands Thursday, says many at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> fear <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION>, who signed on last summer, is a short-term `` hatchet man'' brought in by budget-conscious parent corporation G.E. <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION>'s most visible-to-viewers action so far was to consolidate <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s ballyhooed new `` Sunday Today'' with `` Meet the Press,'' a move credited with prompting former <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, one of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s few big-name news stars, to jump to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 At the request of its Moslem minority, the government of this predominately Christian country has banned the sale and possession in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Njiru </PERSON>, minister for national guidance and political affairs, said Tuesday that the banning was based on `` a short review'' of the book, which many Moslems consider blasphemous. The review, <PERSON> Njiru </PERSON> said, `` clearly indicates that the content of the book is offensive to Moslems who constitute an important section of the Kenyan community.'' About 6 percent of this African country's 20 million people belong to the Islamic community, which had asked the government to institute the ban. Other countries that have banned the book include <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> has called on Moslems to seek out and kill <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who is in hiding, and his government has threatened to break diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> unless it denounces the author. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is among more than a dozen European countries that have recalled their ambassadors from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over the death threat.

<HEAD>National Network Discourages Using Deformed Babies As Donors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Severely deformed babies facing certain death should not be routinely considered as organ donors, even though hundreds of children desperately need new hearts and livers, the national transplant network said. Directors of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION> adopted a policy Tuesday discouraging, at least for now, use of anencephalic infants as organ donors. The board noted, however, `` it is unwise to recommend a moratorium.'' The issue of whether to take organs from anencephalic infants _ babies born without most of their brains _ has troubled experts for some time, but some say it is the only way to save other dying babies and children for whom there are few organs. `` We're certainly not going to take organs from a live person, but in our hearts and in our minds we know these people are not alive,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Broznick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and a proponent of anencephalic donors. <PERSON> Broznick </PERSON> and many other procurement officials are distressed that they must refuse organs from anencephalic infants until all brain activity ceases. By then, the organs often are not fit for transplantation due to infection. Anencephalic infants are born with only part of a brain stem, which controls respiration. Because they do have slight brain stem activity, they are not legally brain dead, a necessary state before organs can be removed from a human body. Half the 1,000 to 2,000 anencephalic babies delivered each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are stillborn. The other half generally die within one week. `` Not all parents would do it -LRB- donate -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. `` But I'm sure there would be a significant number of donors.'' <PERSON> Broznick </PERSON>, in fact, believes there probably would be enough organs to accommodate the 400 to 500 children awaiting liver transplants in this country. `` We could probably take care of all those kids, and we ca n't do anything about it,'' he said. `` By the same token, we could offer this couple -LRB- with an anencephalic baby -RRB- an opportunity for something positive to come out of this life that they've tried to bring in. It's a real sad situation.'' Only one anencephalic child has ever had its organs removed for transplantation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That case occurred on Oct. 16, 1987, at <ORGANIZATION> Loma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The heart recipient, a boy who was born the day of the operation, is doing well at home in <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linda </LOCATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON>. The hospital has had a moratorium since August on cases involving infants suffering from the incurable birth defect. However, anencephalic infants reportedly have been used as organ donors in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Because of the growing interest in the infants as donors, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>'s ethics committee began studying the matter last year. The panel recently presented its recommendation to the network's 32-member board of directors, which adopted the position during a regular meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. The board said further study is needed and could prompt a re-evaluation of its position. `` We must have agreement on how you diagnose death and brain-death in anencephalic infants before we can go any further,'' said <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON>, an ethics committee member. The Virginia-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> administers the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Procurement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transplantation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Taylor's Doctors Targeted in Prescription Drug Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors are investigating allegations that some physicians prescribed excessive quantities of drugs for actress <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, the District Attorney's Office said. The Oscar Award-winning actress is not herself the target of a criminal investigation, spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Albergate </PERSON> said Tuesday. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> admitted in a 1987 magazine interview that she had undergone treatment for addiction to painkillers and alcohol. A call to Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s publicist was n't answered after hours Tuesday. <PERSON> Albergate </PERSON> said the investigation involves allegations that at least two doctors during the past year prescribed excessive amounts of various opiates, barbiturates and stimulants to her `` without medical justification.'' He did not identify the drugs or the doctors, nor did he say when the probe began or what prompted it. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> has not met with authorities, he said. The doctors could be charged with illegally prescribing drugs, a violation of the state's Health and Safety Code, he said. The state Attorney General's Office also is investigating and submit its reports to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s Office, <PERSON> Albergate </PERSON> said `` We are not commenting on it in any way,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office. He did say that a recent law requiring doctors to submit drug forms to the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> makes it possible to monitor prescription drug usage more carefully. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who turned 57 Monday, was honored last Thursday in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> for her philanthropic work. She addressed speculation about her health, saying she fractured her back last summer and it took a long time to heal. `` But I'm fine now,'' she said. Her appearance followed a month-long seclusion that spawned rumors that she had gained weight and underwent treatment for drug or alcohol abuse. Her publicist, <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, said recently that <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was suffering back pain and had been admitted to St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> for X-rays. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> hurt herself in June when she fell on the set of the film `` Young Toscanini'' in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. She has suffered recurring back problems since childhood when she fell off a horse during the filming of `` National Velvet.'' In a 1987 interview, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said she would have died had she not sought treatment for her use of Demerol and alcohol. She won best actress Oscars in 1960 for `` Butterfield 8'' and in 1966 for `` Who's Afraid of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Woolf?''

<TEXT>
 Riot police overpowered and arrested 28 leading dissidents who tried to reach the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> border today for talks with communist officials on reuniting the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Police seized the dissidents after a six-hour standoff on the main highway from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> border truce site. They forced their way onto the dissidents' bus and took them to a nearby police station. `` Get away, get away,'' some of the dissidents shouted as they were taken off the bus at the station. Dissident leader <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jae-oh </PERSON> and some other protesters kicked and punched police trying to take them away. The radical <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> had sent delegates to try and reach the border truce site for talks with North Korean officials on reuniting the peninsula that has been divided since 1945. North Korean radio, in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said its delegates waited at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> for two hours for the dissidents. It accused the South Korean and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> governments of blocking reunification. `` Indiscriminate violence by the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> rulers ... at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists' instigation, is unbearable, undemocratic and an act counter to unification,'' the radio said. South and North Korean officials are to meet Thursday at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> to try and work out terms for a meeting between their prime ministers _ which would be the highest level contact ever between the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION>. Dissident leaders reject the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government's efforts to ease tension with the north and earlier announced plans to conduct their own talks. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> backed the dissidents in an apparent move to embarass <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Lines of riot police with shields blocked the main highway from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> today when the dissidents' bus reached the <LOCATION> Naeyu </LOCATION> checkpoint 12 miles from the border. Troopers with shields immediately surrounded the bus to stop dissidents from getting off and the protesters stayed aboard for about six hours, partly blocking the highway. Angry dissident leaders, leaning from the bus windows, repeatedly denounced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, charging that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> keeps troops in the south to prop up the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government and perpetuate division of the peninsula. `` Withdraw Americans blocking unification,'' the dissidents chanted. A dissident leader read a statement denouncing South Korean President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and charging that it does not want union with the north. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has been holding talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on improving relations as part of a major initiative to reduce tensions on the peninsula. `` The government and the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, if they really want peaceful unification of the nation, should not use force in blocking us,'' the dissident spokesman said. South Korean dissidents are demanding immediate reunification with the communist north, claiming all the south's political problems stem from the peninsula's division. In <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> today, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> delivered one of his strongest warnings yet to radicals and dissidents saying <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can no longer tolerate attempts to overthrow its democratic system. `` We have reached a stage where we can no longer tolerate attempts to topple the government through class revolution,'' he said in a speech marking the 70th anniversary of a nationwide uprising against Japanese colonial rule. `` All of us who share responsibility in this land must take a clear-cut attitude toward anti-democracy groups that shake our free society from its very foundation,'' he said. Dissidents were blocked Tuesday near the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> border site when they tried to meet with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials to make arrangements for today's planned meeting. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military border guards were involved in the scuffle. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has about 42,000 troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty.

Police had begun searching for the mother and they found the boy with the homeless men in the <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> bus terminal Monday evening. Before <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON> was booked, she `` said she was looking for the kid all night _ in hotels, movie theaters and the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Poggioli </PERSON> of the Port Authority youth services. `` But she was n't looking too hard,'' <PERSON> Poggioli </PERSON> said. `` We have people on the street who say they saw her doing crack. ... After 26 hours and you're not looking for your kid, I'd say that's abandonment. <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> police patrol the bus terminal, where dozens of homeless people beg and sleep among thousands of commuters and long-distance travelers. A police officer saw the two men with the child Monday evening and became suspicious, said Juvenile Officer <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. The men said the boy's mother had left him with them while she went out to work as a prostitute, according to <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>. `` They did n't even know her name, or the child's,'' said <PERSON> Poggioli </PERSON>. `` They called her <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>.'' The two men, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON>, 39, and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Villardi </PERSON>, 31, were arrested for trespassing. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said the area in which they were found is reserved for people with bus tickets. Police said they also discovered that <ORGANIZATION> Best </ORGANIZATION> was wanted on drug and weapons possession charges here. The boy was handed over to the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrastia </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> police, said the child's aunt and grandfather, who previously had custody of him, were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and planned to go to Family Court today to try to get the boy back. <PERSON> Poggioli </PERSON> said <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON> was wanted in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on shoplifting charges and once `` went through drug rehab.''

<HEAD>Younger Daley Struggling to Escape His Father's Long Shadow</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, owner of the most famous last name in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> politics, rarely invoked his father's memory during his Democratic mayoral primary campaign. But with his victory secure, he made sure to pay his dues. `` Today, when I was walking down to vote with my wife ... when I looked up, I know he was looking down on me,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said Tuesday night of six-term Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. In unofficial returns, the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> garnered 57 percent of the vote in the primary to oust Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and move to the April 4 general election The elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was the boss of big-city machine politics, the purveyor of patronage, the last of a political breed, dying in 1976 three months into his third decade in office. His son, who often sat in the mayor's seat as a youngster, recalled that his father had told him that in politics, `` you're going to have ups and downs You're going to win; you're going to lose.'' And despite the sterling showing Tuesday, the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has had some of both, in politics and in life. He had to fight to overcome the shadow of his father as he worked his way through his father's old high school and law school. But those difficulties paled compared to the great personal tragedy <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>, endured when their 33-month-old son, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, died in 1981 after a long battle with spina bifida. The couple's three other children, <PERSON> Nora </PERSON>, 15, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 5, stood alongside their 46-year-old father and his wife on the victory platform Tuesday night. In a poignant moment, he thanked each, then added, `` and especially, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, who is always in our hearts. And to the best campaigner in the family, my wife, <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> also went through a hurtful defeat in a 1983 three-way primary between himself, then-incumbent Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who won and went on to become the city's first black mayor `` I've been on both sides of these election nights,'' he recalled Tuesday. `` I know what it's like to win, and I know what it's like to pour your heart into a campaign and lose.'' It took <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> three tries to pass the bar exam to become a lawyer, a sore point exploited during the campaign by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other opponents. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> responded with a brusqueness many say is reminiscent of his father. `` I flunked the bar exam. So what? Maybe I should have committed suicide,'' he said. Besides, he added, a passing grade only would have led to charges that `` my father had it fixed for me.'' To be sure, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> has been helped by his name _ getting elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> at age 29, and as <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney three times, including the first win against a party-slated candidate But there's no easy way to say how strong his father's effect has been, said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and author of a biography of the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> entitled `` Himself.'' `` There's nobody like his father. ... But <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> has acquired a confidence in himself and his judgment that resemble the father in some ways. And he's overcome enough adversity on his own ... to establish a separate identity, to start the long climb out from under his father's shadow,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The eldest of seven children, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> had his first political post as an 18-year-old page for the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> delegation to the 1960 Democratic National Convention. In the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he showed more acumen than many gave him credit for, and forged alliances with anti-machine reformers on social-welfare legislation affecting nursing homes and abolishing taxes on certain foods and medicine. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruesi </PERSON>, a top aide, said <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> studied hard as a legislator and knew his material. `` Rich has been handicapped by the fact that people have trouble getting past his name,'' <PERSON> Kruesi </PERSON> said. `` If his name were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, he'd be lionized for the work he's done as a legislator and as state's attorney.''

<HEAD>Measles Hit Some Colleges Hard, But Outbreaks Are Scattered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Measles has hit some colleges this winter, but federal health officials said outbreaks of the disease normally associated with childhood are scattered and no cause for great alarm. Students lined up for measles vaccine last week at the C.W. Post campus of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and free inoculations were offered this week at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. A measles outbreak caused <ORGANIZATION> Catawba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, to cancel its basketball season and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> stopped sending nursing students to local hospitals for fear of giving patients measles. `` We're definitely having measles outbreaks right now, but it is unfortunately nothing new,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>'s immunization division. `` We do get outbreaks on college campuses and high school campuses -LRB- each year -RRB-.'' Most states require children to be inoculated for measles before entering school, but some still reach college without immunity. In some cases, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, the vaccine does n't take; in others, colleges may not have required proof of immunization. At C.W. Post, where 19 cases were reported as of Monday, immunization rules are now being strictly enforced, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON>. Measles cases at <ORGANIZATION> Siena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> prompted the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> to ban spectators from the scheduled March 9-11 basketball tournament. Measles can be transmitted easily at colleges because of close living quarters, said <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, assistant director for nursing services at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. Only three cases have been reported at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, but 154 cases were reported recently in <LOCATION> Lubbock </LOCATION>, many of them in public schools and at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the outbreak prompted immunization of 5,200 students. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also reported measles at <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. Through last week, 244 measles cases had been reported nationwide since Jan. 1, up from 204 at the same time last year, according to <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> statistics. But <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said those figures may not reflect the recent college outbreaks or other recent outbreaks among younger children. Measles, or rubeola, is usually marked by a rash, fever, cough, congestion, and red, sensitive eyes. Complications can occur without proper treatment. In the late 1970s, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> measles specialists believed the once common childhood disease could be eradicated in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by fall 1982, but in the last six years, 1,497 to 6,282 cases have been reported annually.

 The ethics investigation of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was expanded to include an allegation that he threatened to expose a federal thrift regulator's homosexuality unless <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift executives gained access to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said through a spokesman the allegation was `` preposterous,'' the newspaper said. The Times quoted sources as saying <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was accused of threatening federal officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with `` blowing the whistle'' on a federal thrift regulator's alleged homosexuality unless <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift executives were allowed to meet with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Executives of at least two <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan associations felt they could not get fair hearings at the bank board's <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office, where the federal official in question worked, the Times said. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> thrift executives were complaining of over-regulation, and some of them were friends of the speaker, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, told the newspaper, `` The speaker never threatened to expose anything. It's a figment of someone's imagination, someone with an obvious ax to grind.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has been investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Official </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> since last fall regarding alleged attempts to influence federal regulators on behalf of several <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan executives. He also has been accused of accepting a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> condominium at a price below market value, of ordering a member of his staff to work on his book and of using the book's royalties to skirt limits on outside income. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Public TV Station Plans Service To Make Television Vivid For The

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A public television station has developed a service that makes TV vivid for the blind and visually impaired by having a narrator describe a program's setting and action during pauses in dialogue. The service, developed by <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> WGBH-TV </ORGANIZATION>, which also pioneered closed captions for the hearing impaired 15 years ago, broadcasts the added narration over a special channel that can be tapped by people with a stereo television or a video cassette recorder. The station tested the service last year and is seeking funding to make it available in January 1990 to the nation's estimated 12 million visually impaired people. `` I never realized when I watched television, from a listening perspective, that I was missing so much,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlson </PERSON> recalled Tuesday. Blind since the age of 11, the 31-year-old <LOCATION> Watertown </LOCATION> resident was among thousands of visually impaired people across the country who tuned to the service's trial run. Television `` is a major means of communication in society,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Charlson </PERSON> said. `` There's so much on television, you tend to feel left out when you ca n't access it. I really commend them that they're trying to do it, and do it right.'' Descriptive Video Services allows anyone with visual impairment _ or even sighted people stepping away from their TV set _ to follow the show. With a stereo television set or VCR tuned to the Separate Audio Program channel, they can hear a narrator describe a program's scene and action during musical interludes or breaks in dialogue <ORGANIZATION> WGBH </ORGANIZATION> enlisted nine other public TV stations to test the service from January to July 1988 on the PBS `` American Playhouse'' drama series. A viewer tuned to the play `` Lemon Sky,'' for example, could hear as the credits rolled: `` A mountain silhouette in the distance, palm trees closer. A boy's bike between a high, brown wooden fence. In the foreground a white, mid -'50s convertible gleaming in the sun, its top down Then later, after a character spoke his lines: `` He strolls away from the car toward the house, pausing in the doorway.'' `` I see it as something that can become widely popular and should be,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, who evaluates high-tech aides for the blind at the American Federation for the Blind in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It's not a question only of people who are totally blind,'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` There are millions of people who have very poor vision and can not see small details on the screen, people who are losing their vision at any time of life.'' The establishment of the Separate Audio Program channel about five years ago makes the new television service possible. About 10 percent of American homes can tap the audio channel now, and <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, director of Descriptive Video Services, predicted access to the channel would be common by the turn of the century. `` In a couple of years you wo n't be able to buy a television that is n't stereo,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> WGBH </ORGANIZATION> is trying to raise $ 300,000 to launch the service nationally five hours a week and needs $ 1 million annually to keep it going, Ms. <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Operators of two bookstores where firebombings may be linked to sales of `` The Satanic Verses'' pledged not to stop selling the book despite the violence, which caused modest damage but no injuries. Bookstores throughout the country have been threatened if they carry the book that Moslems call blasphemous. The bombings at <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>'s and Waldenbooks in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and at a weekly newspaper in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> early Tuesday were the first signs of violence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> At eight bookstores in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, employees opening for business Tuesday found crudely worded, poorly typed notes warning that something `` bad'' would happen to shopowners selling the novel. The notes were signed `` American Moslems.'' <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>'s owner <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> found no such threat, but he said he had little doubt the firebombings were connected to the novel that prompted <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to issue a death order for the Moslem author, <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, and the book's publishers. `` I ca n't imagine any other reason why people would be lobbing bombs through bookstores _ <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>'s or anyone's,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> reiterated an announcement issued last week that the store would n't give in to pressure. `` We do not have it now, but we will be selling it,'' he said while surveying the damage to his shop, a landmark dating from the 1960s Free Speech movement that originated in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. Waldenbooks manager <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gammon </PERSON> also had no plan to halt his order for the book, although he might if he received threats or feared for public safety. He said there was no evidence that the book was to blame for the bombings. Waldenbooks sold out `` Verses'' the day after the <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s threat, he said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, an incendiary device was tossed through the window of the <ORGANIZATION> Riverdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, heavily damaging the building, authorities said. No one was inside at the time. The firebombing may have been in retaliation for an editorial the paper ran last week supporting the right to read the novel, said firefighter <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McTigue </PERSON>. Four hours after the Molotov cocktail bombings at the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> bookshops, a pipe bomb was found in <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>'s. It was destroyed by a police bomb squad without further damage to the bookstore, said police Lt. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Latour </PERSON>. He said there were no suspects and few leads. One man, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideout </PERSON>, 44, told officers he was sleeping in his van outside <PERSON> Cody </PERSON>'s when he heard crashing glass and a car race off Workers spent the day repairing damage at <ORGANIZATION> Cody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, which was limited to broken glass, a few scorched shelves and some damaged books. <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> said he planned to leave a charred end case in place for a while as a reminder of the incident. In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, meanwhile, novelist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> recited the first three pages of `` The Satanic Verses'' at a reading <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> was to have attended at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. Other writers also read from the book and from the new novel, `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dollar </PERSON>,'' published by <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wife, <PERSON> Marianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>. `` This is a solidarity movement to show that writers must be allowed to find their admirers and their enemies'' without being threatened, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> told the 150 people who attended the reading. Iranian clerics have put a $ 5.2 million bounty on the 41-year-old <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s head and he is in hiding with his wife in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> under police guard.

 Hundreds of suspected Nazi war criminals migrated to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> after World War II and about 250 are under active investigation for major atrocities, a government-appointed Nazi hunter said today. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he has more than 500 names on file, all immigrants who took out citizenship when immigration formalities were virtually non-existent. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> previously had said his department was investigating almost 400 names supplied by the <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiesenthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.

Most of the crimes <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> is investigating were committed by Eastern Europeans, he said, refusing to go into detail. `` We have in excess of 540 people and about half, or 250, are under active investigation,'' <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> said. `` We are dealing with people who came to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> after World War II, took out citizenship or became longstanding residents, who had committed war crimes.'' The government enacted legislation last year to prosecute Nazi war criminals but exempted Australian war veterans and Japanese. Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> after a radio program on the government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> alleged that former <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> sought refuge in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> after 1945 and were now living comfortably. <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Baume </PERSON> says he has found out with the help of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s Freedom of Information Act that some of the suspected war criminals are guilty of killing thousands of people. The <ORGANIZATION> Brisbane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> may be forced to seek more time from Attorney-General <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> to complete files on Australian citizens suspected of committing wartime atrocities. He initially began investigating 70 names, but more were provided by <PERSON> Wiesenthal </PERSON>, who spent part of the war in a Nazi death camp. The newspaper said the first of 12 major prosecutions are expected in June. Opponents of the War Crimes Act have argued that war crimes trials would be too time-consuming and expensive. Critics also have argued against the reliability of Soviet evidence in such exercises. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> is due to report his findings within one month but he told the <ORGANIZATION> Brisbane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, `` We still have a long way to go.'' He said most suspects were from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Baltic states and had worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> regime to carry out crimes against Jews, the handicapped and others as part of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s `` purification program.'' <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> expressed shock at some of the atrocities. `` <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> accepted hundreds of thousands of people from all over <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, so some -LRB- alleged war criminals -RRB- obviously have come to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` In hindsight, there were not enough resources to adequately screen immigrants. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> was crying out for immigrants in the immediate post-war years and just filling the ships to bring them to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>,'' which now has double the population of 16 million. <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> has traveled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to pursue his investigations.

<HEAD>Officials From Other Hollywoods Try To Block Name Grab By Tinseltown</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tinseltown </LOCATION> may be the best known <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, but at least 11 others around the country do n't want their name to be taken in vain Representatives of the other Hollywoods held a summit here Tuesday to plot their opposition to the movie capital's attempt to trademark the community's name and collect royalties for its use. `` They should just back off, honestly,'' said <PERSON> Mara </PERSON> <PERSON> Giulianti </PERSON>, mayor of this seaside city of 125,000, just north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I do n't believe a make-believe Hollywood can compete with the things we're doing.'' Trademark opponents offered historical arguments, civic pride, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution and a bit of showmanship _ a 7-foot egret that is this city's mascot _ to buttress their campaign to keep their name in the public domain. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> applied in 1986 for a trademark with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trademark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, and comment will be accepted until March 18. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiaro </PERSON>, city attorney for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, said opponents may seek an extension to force <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to prove ownership of the name. A trademark would guarantee power to regulate promotional, educational and legislative activity under the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> name and would allow the trademark holder to charge royalties, she said. Ms. <PERSON> Giulianti </PERSON> began uniting the other Hollywoods last week, and representatives from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> gathered here. They agreed to draft a resolution for a joint fight and may form an unofficial sister cities program. `` We feel a protest loud and clear will be warranted,'' said the mayor, wearing a rhinestone `` Hollywood'' pin in her jacket lapel. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> commissioner from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said the trademark issue `` would have ramifications down the road which would be hard to swallow.'' `` Let's kindle the fire a little hotter because I'm hot,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Dover </PERSON> of rural <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in northeast <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. `` Hollywood vs. <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Let's see how the fight turns out. Right now, it's looking a little better.'' His unincorporated community was founded in 1807, which he claimed makes it the oldest <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The name <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> was registered with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> recorder 80 years later after having been adopted from an estate near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that is now part of <LOCATION> Brookfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said the proposed trademark would merely help the chamber garner royalties from the sale of souvenirs to pay for upkeep of attractions like the 1,800 stars in the Walk of Fame and the big, white Hollywood sign `` We are not going to make them pay to use the name,'' said <PERSON> Welsh </PERSON>. `` We have tried time and again to tell that lady -LRB- <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Giulanti </PERSON> -RRB- and other people down there ... and we just ca n't seem to get the point across.'' But even some in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> expressed sympathy with the trademark opponents. The <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has suggested filing a counterclaim to the application. `` Do not make the name <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> synonymous with profit,'' the association officers wrote. `` It would be a disservice to all average citizens of Hollywoods everywhere who live and raise families and proudly say, ` Hooray for Hollywoods.'''

<HEAD>Scathing Criticism of Communist Party in Soviet Magazine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an attack unprecedented in the state-run press, a prominent sociologist has accused the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of spreading `` political lies'' that have deceived the Soviet people for generations. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klyamkin </PERSON>'s article in February's editions of Novy Mir magazine comes as the Soviets prepare for next month's national elections _ the first in which voters will have more than one candidate to choose from. In an obvious reference to President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s push for `` democratization'' as part of his reform campaign, the author asserts that genuine democracy will not be possible unless the 20 million-member party permits open dissent in its ranks. <PERSON> Klyamkin </PERSON> hints at the central paradox of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` democratization'' push _ that it is occurring under the aegis of a party that has declared itself society's sole legitimate ruler The author does not openly call for the creation of a multiparty system, but that seems the inescapable conclusion many will draw from his criticism of anti-democratic practices he says the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has engaged in starting from the days of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. `` The major reason for lies starting to dominate society was that the majority, whatever it was composed of, was fated to limit interparty democracy and violate the rights of the minority. This was discovered even when <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> was still alive,'' <PERSON> Klyamkin </PERSON> wrote. `` The political lie,'' he said, `` leads to catastrophe when some organization or group of people has a full monopoly on power and information, where nobody can catch them deceiving others, or to put it more simply _ when there is no democracy.'' The article seems certain to fuel debate about the party's role in political institutions being created this year as part of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plan to define more clearly the responsibilities of party and government. Later this month, Soviet voters are to elect a new 2,550-seat <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies that will choose a more active Supreme Soviet parliament and the country's president, the government position held by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who also is party general secretary. <PERSON> Klyamkin </PERSON> said the political reforms are flawed by measures `` which even the most vivid imagination can not call democratic.'' The political changes give the party and other officially recognized organizations the right to directly fill one third of the seats in the new assembly and, unlike current practice, impose a two-step system for the election of Supreme Soviet deputies, who since 1937 have been directly chosen by voters but who will now be elected by the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are no free elections yet, and I'm not sure that there will be any soon,'' wrote <PERSON> Klyamkin </PERSON>, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> think tank. He also said anti-democratic traditions in the party had not palpably changed in the nearly four years that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been at the helm and that open debate on major issues is still muzzled by the quest for `` monolithic unity.'' The article was the latest published by official media criticizing the role of the party in society. In January, the Leningrad-based magazine <PERSON> Neva </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign for economic and social change was being sabotaged by a `` new class'' of party and government bureaucrats, and that the leadership was powerless to stop it Despite the party's claim that it serves the people and is the `` vanguard of society,'' the average Soviet `` practically never had access to the real levers of power and does n't have it now either,'' biologist and plant director <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON> wrote in <LOCATION> Neva </LOCATION>. In a speech Friday in the Ukrainian capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> used traditional formulas in describing the party he leads as the `` vanguard social force,'' but said it should be society's guide, and not its commanding officer.

 Movie buffs and preservationists celebrated <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>'s first feature film with a showing of the long-lost movie in the barn where it was filmed 75 years ago. On hand for Tuesday night's screening of `` The Squaw Man'' was <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasky </PERSON>, daughter of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> pioneer <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasky </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Thousands Converge On Capital To Protest Alleged Persecution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By IVAN STEFANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 4,000 <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> Slavs and their children converged on <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> today to protest alleged ethnic persecution by the majority Albanians in the impoverished southern region, the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The flag-carrying, chanting Serbs and Montenegrins jammed steets and interrupted traffic as they walked from the railroad station to the downtown parliament. Taxi drivers, brandishing pictures of the popular Serbian party chief <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, gave free rides to the elderly. Speaking to a rally in the capital Tuesday that drew an estimated 500,000 people, <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> vowed to arrest the organizers of protests and strikes by ethnic Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> _ an autonomous province of the Serbian republic. Serbs who support <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> believe the Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which was ancient <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s heartland, want to unite the province with neighboring <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. About 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s people are ethnic Albanians. Growing ethnic nationalism has created the greatest threat to <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> unity since the 1980 death of President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, whose leadership held the disparate nation of 23 million people together. An economic crisis has combined with the resurgence of ethnic and religious rivalries to threaten the loose confederation of six republics and two provinces. The republics of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> support demands by ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> for guarantees that <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s autonomy will not be restricted. The two are <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most liberal and economically advanced republics. <LOCATION> Macedonia </LOCATION> supports the Serbs, the largest ethnic group in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> was outwardly peaceful Tuesday, except for scattered Serbian protests, under emergency measures imposed Monday after a week of unrest among the province's 1.8 million people. Official Yugoslav media said about 1,000 Slavs had announced plans to leave <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> immediately, alleging harassment by ethnic Albanians. Meanwhile, 500 ethnic Albanians in the <LOCATION> Trepca </LOCATION> lead-zinc mine in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> continued their strike to protest Serbian plans to change the constitution in a bid to win greater control over their province. On Monday, 1,300 ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> miners came out from pits after an eight-day sit-in that forced the resignation of three <ORGANIZATION> Kosovo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders they consider pro-Serbian. Doctors from <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> said the exhausted miners would be unable to work for at least a week. <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said peace prevailed this morning in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s capital of <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, where additional military vehicles and soldiers had been sent on Monday.

<TEXT>
 A 91-year-old man described by federal law enforcement officials as a `` financial top man'' among bookies has been freed despite his refusal to cooperate in a criminal investigation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> `` Doc'' <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> released from the <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, reversing an earlier decision. He did not comment on the decision. `` It feels good to be out,'' <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> said as he left with his son. `` I'm just going to go home and have some dinner.'' His lawyer, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldings </PERSON>, described <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> as suffering from depression last week in asking the 1st U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to review the case. <PERSON> Goldings </PERSON> said the appeals court suggested that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> review the case. In court papers, <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> said he feared `` bodily harm'' to himself and his family if he answered a grand jury's questions about a case involving the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. At one point, <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> said he would rather die in jail than share his knowledge with law enforcement officials. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in June 1987 said that <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> and two men reputed to be potential leaders in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> mob were targets of a racketeering investigation. But <PERSON> Goldings </PERSON> said his client was being sought as a witness and was not a target of investigators. <PERSON> Sagansky </PERSON> invoked the Fifth Amendment before a federal grand jury on July 1, 1987, and declined to answer questions. He was later granted immunity from prosecution but still refused to answer questions. He was ordered jailed by Young on Feb. 3, 1988, after discussions with federal prosecutors concerning the federal witness protection plan fell through.

 The once-secret `` Helga'' portfolio of paintings and drawings by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> is for sale for $ 40 million. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> E.B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> publisher and art collector who bought the 240 works from <LOCATION> Wyeth </LOCATION> in 1986, said Tuesday that his intention had been to show the collection to the American public, `` and we've done that in spades.'' The collection consists of nudes and other portraits of <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> <PERSON> Testorf </PERSON>, a neighbor of <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON>'s. The works were created in secret for 15 years and caught the art world's eye when <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> bought them. When he purchased the collection, <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said only that he had paid `` several million.'' Estimates of the price have varied from $ 6 million to $ 20 million. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> agreed never to reveal the price tag. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wyeth </PERSON> `` is aware of -LRB- the sale -RRB- and understands my reasoning.'' He said his reasons for selling include the lack of facilities to house the collection. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said he intends to sell the collection intact and not piecemeal. He said he has been approached by American and Japanese interests. The <PERSON> Helga </PERSON> works have been exhibited to more than 1 million people at six museums across the country during the past two years but were not favorably received by many critics and scholars. They are to be displayed this summer at the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

 The number of poor families with children is growing rapidly, increasing the number of youngsters without proper health care, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> and Related Institutions said today. In a report, the group predicted that by the end of the century one-third of all American children will live below the poverty line, and that youngsters from such families are at the highest risk for poor health. `` The No. 1 key to the poor status of our nation's children relative to their health is insurance, and ... we see that 12 million of them, one in every five, do not have insurance, either public or private,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Considine </PERSON>, chairman of the association, said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show. He said the study's authors found that 7 million children do not receive routine medical care from the ages of 1 to 4. The parents delay care, he said, `` because they can not access the care because of the inability of insurance.'' Thus, <PERSON> Considine </PERSON> added, `` those children do not come to our childrens' hospitals throughout the country until their course -LRB- of illness -RRB- is well-developed, and it's at a state where it's more costly and the consequences already more developed and set in.'' The report also noted: _ Nearly 40,000 of the 3.8 million children born in 1987 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> died before their first birthday _ Since 1979, nearly a quarter of all pregnant women received little or no prenatal care _ Low birth-weight infants in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> have remained at 6.8 percent of the infants born, in contrast to 4 percent in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> _ Child abuse and neglect increased by 55 percent between 1981 and 1985 `` We seem to be exploiting our children much more than we're nurturing our children,'' <PERSON> Considine </PERSON> said _ The rate of suicide among people aged 15 to 19 has doubled in two decades _ Less than 60 percent of children under the age of four received the complete basic series of immunizations in 1985, and cases of mumps, measles and whooping cough have increased `` Only about 75 percent of all our children 1 to 4 are being immunized to measles before that age of 4,'' <PERSON> Considine </PERSON> said. `` That's a shocking statistic to us. We have the technology and the talent. We're just not getting that to our children,'' <PERSON> Considine </PERSON> said. _ The number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome among children has doubled in the last year _ Every year, 1.1 million teen-aged girls become pregnant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>

The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said those executed _ 48 men and two women _ had been found guilty of possession and sale of more than 70,000 pounds of narcotics. Some also had been convicted of other crimes such as arms smuggling and theft, according to an agency report monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said 14 executions took place in the capital, <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, and the others in <LOCATION> Kerman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hamedan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sabzevar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nahavand </LOCATION>, Shiraz, <LOCATION> Qom </LOCATION>, Neishapur, <LOCATION> Gonbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Isfahan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Birjand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mashhad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bakhtaran </LOCATION>. The executions are part of a nationwide crackdown on drugs. Since a new anti-drug law went into effect Jan. 21, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has reported 225 executions of drug smugglers. The new law carries the death sentence for possession of small quantities of drugs, and gives addicts six months to kick the habit or face jail terms. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, reported earlier this month that 1,750 addicts were rounded up in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s western provinces in a 24-hour period.

 Whimsical poet <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Armour </PERSON>, who wrote thousands of pieces of verse that poked fun at everything in his path _ from poets to catsup bottles _ has died at age 82. <PERSON> Armour </PERSON>, who died Tuesday in a convalescent home here after a battle with <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>'s disease, once said he developed a love of words while studying `` 10 dead or deadly languages'' for his Ph.D. in English in <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. A professor at <ORGANIZATION> Scripps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> here, <ORGANIZATION> Armour </ORGANIZATION> once said he wore two costumes: the cap and gown of the academician and the cap and bells of a clown. He published 65 books, most of which featured at least some of his more than 10,000 published poems. He also contributed to more than 200 magazines in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, including the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> and Saturday Evening Post, and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, `` Armour's Armory.'' His aim as a writer, he once said, was to `` sum up in four lines what a pedant would call a universal truth _ and to leave it writhing.'' About poetry he wrote: That poem is a splendid thing. I love to hear you quote it. I like the thought, I like the swing. I like it all. -LRB- I wrote it -RRB-. His poems also explored the everyday: Shake and shake The catsup bottle.

<TEXT>
 Two boxcars loaded with radioactive waste were en route today from the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flats </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant to a temporary storage site in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, relieving a waste buildup that threatened to close the plant. <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, who in October closed his state to shipments of radioactive waste, lifted his ban on Thursday. He said he would allow two boxcars a month for six months to unload at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> cited national security interests. Rocky Flats, operated for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, produces plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons. The plant 17 miles from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> could have been shut down as early as this month. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> in October threatened to close it when it reached its waste storage capacity. The boxcars, which <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Heintz </PERSON> said left Tuesday for a trip that takes seven to nine days, contained 150 cubic yards of clothing and equipment contaminated with small amounts of plutonium. `` We're real pleased to get it out,'' <PERSON> Heintz </PERSON> said. `` This gives us another six months' breathing room to work on a permanent solution with DOE and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Before Tuesday, 1,332 cubic yards of waste had piled up at the plant, which is under a state-imposed limit of 1,601 cubic yards of storage. One hundred-fifty cubic yards is about a month's worth of waste generated under current plant production levels. When Rocky Flats is operating at full capacity, it generates 200 to 250 cubic yards of waste each month. Last week, <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he would allow <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> to continue operations until late this year, depending on how much waste is generated there. <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> are pushing <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> officials to meet a target date of Sept. 1 for the opening of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near <LOCATION> Carlsbad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, for permanent storage of nuclear waste.

 Four gunmen kidnapped a Japanese businessman in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, early today after breaking into his home and tying up his wife and two maids, government officials said. <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Asao </PERSON>, 61, branch manager of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION> office, was abducted, a company spokesman quoted <PERSON> Asao </PERSON>'s wife as saying. Goverment sources said four men participated in the kidnapping, none of them Japanese. The company spokesman, <PERSON> Shuzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Uematsu </PERSON>, said no one has claimed responsibility, nor had the company received any threats beforehand. At a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> Mitsui </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office, <PERSON> Uematsu </PERSON> said the company contacted <PERSON> Asao </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, and confirmed the kidnapping, but communication was too poor to learn details.

 Aircraft manufacturers will be hard-pressed to meet the anticipated demand for new planes to replace aging jetliners, industry analysts say. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> already have `` interesting challenges ahead'' in meeting the `` delivery commitments already made,'' said <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Switzerland </ORGANIZATION> in an interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Some models ordered today wo n't be delivered until 1996, he said. `` At this point, pouring more orders into the funnel is n't going to make more airplanes come out at the bottom,'' said <PERSON> Demisch </PERSON>. `` The greater risk is that in this rush suppliers will be overstretched and ca n't deliver as quickly as expected. Already there are components in tight supply, and that's not going to get much easier.'' With the joint government-industry <ORGANIZATION> Aging </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> recommending that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> order $ 800 million in maintenance, analysts predicted the pressure to replace older planes will increase. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> said airlines saw the need to replace planes several years ago as maintenance costs began rising. `` I think a lot of orders seen in the last two or three years have been for replacement,'' <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said. `` Before that, orders were just for traffic growth.'' <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> said he expected 600 to 700 new plane orders annually over the next few years, including as many as 200 to 300 to replace older planes. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s stock has held firm in the $ 60 range during the latest incident involving a plane it built, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 747 in which the fuselage tore open after takeoff from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> on Friday. Nine passengers were sucked to their deaths from the plane. Investigators have focused on a cargo door as a likely cause of the incident. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said consumers have n't blamed carriers or <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> for the accident, the recent crash of a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 737 that killed 44 or the <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 737 that ripped open in April, sending a flight attendant to her death. `` There's no question <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is going through a string of unfortunate troubles, from crashes, holes developing in its planes in flight, and with quality problems on new aircraft,'' he said, `` but <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has more planes out there than any other manufacturer and they are getting older.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials have denied any connection between the recent spate of incidents.

<TEXT>
 The nation's largest guerrilla group has declared a unilateral cease-fire in the latest bid to end an insurgency that has claimed 76,000 lives in the last quarter-century. <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arenas </PERSON>, leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, declared in a recorded message broadcast over radio nationwide that the cease-fire began at 6 p.m. Tuesday. While no incidents had been reported early today, President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s administration has expressed pessimism about the chances of stopping the insurrection. Right-wing death squads have sprung up in response to the leftist guerrillas, and the rightists have been blamed for killing at least 1,000 people in the last three years. Also on Tuesday, a peace commission in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> began work toward a general cease-fire to the insurrection, which has claimed 76,000 lives in the past 76 years. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Orejuela </PERSON> <PERSON> Buena </PERSON>, minister of government, said last week the guerrillas were manipulating the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> church-sponsored commission and it had little more chance of success than the last president, <PERSON> Belisario </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>, experienced in pursuing a cease-fire. <PERSON> Betancur </PERSON>'s government negotiated a truce with most of the estimated 10,000 guerrillas in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s five guerrilla armies, but it collapsed under the weight of accusations by rebels and security forces. <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelsen </PERSON>, a former president from <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, on Tuesday rejected the government minister's criticism of the commission. `` Trying to save human lives and put an end to the spilling of blood, I am disposed to hear all those of good faith and even bad faith who might have something to suggest,'' he said in a statement. Two other rebel groups, the April 19 Movement and the Quintin Lame, said last month they would like to begin peace talks, but the remaining two have shown no inclination to negotiate. One, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded Monday at the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> offices of an American missionary group, the <ORGANIZATION> Summer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linguistics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Duncanville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> vetoed an ordinance offering shelter in municipal buildings to thousands of homeless people, calling it unnecessary, costly and potentially damaging to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s convention business Tuesday's veto came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> voted 8-0 to use municipal buildings to provide shelter, heat, restrooms and security for homeless people for 60 days. The ordinance would have opened up Recreation Department buildings, the vacant <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION> and a Civic Center meeting place where an estimated 40,000 people are attending a convention of automotive engineers. `` To begin with, more effective and responsible plans for the homeless already have been and are being implemented,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a statement. `` In addition, this ordinance is so broad and far-reaching as to be unworkable. `` It would cost over $ 2 million to operate, it would seriously curtail vital neighborhood programs run by the <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, and it would seriously damage our ability to bring meetings and conventions and the thousands of jobs they create to the Civic Center,'' he said. <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said existing shelters had beds available every night and that the city's Homeless Intervention Program has placed 400 homeless families in permanent housing. But advocates for the homeless disputed that claim. `` We do n't have any records of him placing anybody, and especially not ... 400 people,'' said <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Detroit-Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of the Homeless. `` He's not done half of what he says he's done.''

The editor said Iraqi children get free education, health care and social security. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> issued a report on Tuesday saying that `` children and young people have become the innocent victims of a policy of political repression'' in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It said opponents of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s government have sometimes had to pay for their activities with `` the welfare _ and sometimes the lives _ of their children'' between 1983 and 1988. Children as young as five months old have been imprisoned, and hundreds have disappeared, the report said.

 The right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc upset the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in nationwide municipal elections, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said today the voting indicates Israelis support <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-PLO policies. <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and finance minister, insisted Tuesday's balloting had nothing to do with the Palestinian issue and said he was willing to hold a separate referendum on the subject. Other Labor leaders demanded a shakeup to halt a decline in their party's standing since November, when <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won the premiership in national elections. Political analysts said the results showed Labor's historic dominance of the grass-roots level had eroded. In a key race of Tuesday's election, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> was re-elected for a sixth term. But he lost control of the city council as religious parties increased their representation to nearly half the city council. The biggest gains were made by such ultra-Orthodox parties as <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION>, Agudat <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Degel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatorah </PERSON>. Their success will probably give them more power than the traditional, more moderate Orthodox parties. The religious gains also could fuel tensions between secular and observant Jews in the city, because <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> will need to enlist the support of the ultra-Orthodox to govern, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> news reports said. But the 77-year-old <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>, who has been in office since 1965, said he still expected to control the city. `` I will ... give other people an ulcer instead of getting one myself,'' he said. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahat </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> mayor of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, also won re-election. The results in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, where Labor Mayor <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurel </PERSON> was in a tight race with his <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> rival, were uncertain after a dispute developed today over the counting of ballots, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> appeared to have won several Labor strongholds, including the southern port of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION> and the town of <LOCATION> Beersheba </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> also won several communities around <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> that Labor had held, including Holon, <LOCATION> Petach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tikvah </LOCATION> and Ramat Gan. Ultra-Orthodox religious parties scored gains throughout the country, repeating their success of the November general elections, according to unofficial results based on 43 percent of the vote. At stake were 147 local councils and mayoralities. In the last national municipal elections in 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> won in 54 towns, compared to 26 taken by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>. The remainder went to local slates or religious parties. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who had billed the elections as a referendum on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s refusal to negotiate peace with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio the results `` will signal to various people in the world, so they know who is dominant in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> political system, who is the one who determines, who has the stronger voice. `` There is no doubt that the elections ... show <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> is getting stronger and at the same time the majority ... supports its political positions.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> acknowledged in a radio interview that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> `` has definitely been dealt a blow, and I do n't want to underestimate its force.'' But he disputed claims the results showed wide public support for <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s views on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict. Officially both Labor and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> oppose <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> participation in peace talks, based on a claim that it is a terrorist organization. But there are growing calls inside Labor to reconsider this policy now that <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has said he renounces terrorism and recognizes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. Labor leaders, including <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aides, have met recently with prominent Palestinians in the occupied territories who are known to be <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> supporters. Energy Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON> of Labor said his party's losses were a further sign of the decline of the party that has failed to win any of the last four general elections. On the national level, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> have been governing in an uneasy coalition since 1984, with neither party able to score an outright victory in general elections. About 48 percent of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 2.7 million voters went to the polls on Tuesday, down from 55 percent in 1983. Voters cast two ballots, one for mayor and the second for a party slate for city council. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> won 64 percent, while his slate received 12 of 31 council seats, down from 17. Religious parties, meanwhile, increased their seats from 10 to 15. <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> lost his majority in part because of the boycott of east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s 80,000 Arab voters, traditionally <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> backers. Fewer than 2 percent went to the polls, compared to 18 percent in 1983. The boycott was ordered by the PLO-allied leadership of the 15-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The leaders called a general strike Tuesday to enforce the order and urged Palestinians to punish those who ignored the boycott. In the Arab sector, <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalists ousted the communist leadership of the second-largest city, <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fahem </LOCATION>, causing concern that anti-Israeli sentiment is spreading among Israeli Arabs.

<TEXT>
 For decades, Venezuelans dreamed that oil would cure the economic woes of their petroleum-rich country. That illusion, held even after oil prices began to plummet, appears to have ended with the worst violence in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> in 31 years. Increases of 30 percent to 50 percent in public transport tariffs and price gouging by bus drivers acted as a detonator for an economy in rapid deterioration. The slide in the price of oil, which accounts for 90 percent of Venezuelan export revenue, coupled with a suffocating $ 33 billion foreign debt. The nation pocketed an estimated $ 9 billion in oil revenues last year, compared to $ 19 billion in 1981. Inflation this year is expected to reach 70 percent, up from 35 percent last year. President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who took power three weeks ago, announced a sweeping economic reform package intended to breathe life into the stagnant economy and persuade international bankers to increase loans to the country. Some of those reforms included freeing interest rates, doubling gasoline prices, and establishing a free-floating currency with a consequent increase in the price of imports. The violence that erupted across the nation Monday showed the difficulty the government will have implementing the economic reforms. The reforms were backed by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, from which <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> hopes to obtain a $ 1.5 billion short-term loan. Until now, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> had avoided turning to the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> for a bailout. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> himself called the organization the equivalent of `` economic totalitarianism.'' <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has 18 million inhabitants and was for years an island of tranquility in a sea of regional violence, political instability and economic recession. Under <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s first administration, from 1973 to 1978, oil prices boomed and the country enjoyed an unparalleled prosperity. There was full employment and inflation did not break single digits. Those memories were enough to guarantee <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> a landslide victory in the election Dec. 4, say political experts `` Perez evoked for Venezuelans a bonanza, and now they've had a rude awakening,'' said sociologist and university professor <PERSON> Anibal </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> said he did not believe the disturbances threatened <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s democracy, saying the country had lived through worst crises, including guerrilla movements in the 1960s. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, former leftist presidential candidate and congressman, said the riots represented `` the beginnings of an end of an era, of a style of life.'' `` It's the breaking of the illusion that all politicians had that this could never happen here. It did happen indeed, and it's proof of the impoverishment of the country. We're not used to inflation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tacoma Zoo Needs More Room for Elephants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The elephants of Point Defiance Zoo are getting bigger homes at a $ 1.5 million cost, improvements necessitated largely by a profoundly problematic pachyderm named <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, the zoo director says. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>, a 24-year-old from <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, is returning after six years on loan to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park. In fact, the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> zoo is pleading with <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> officials to hasten <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON>'s return, said zoo director <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Otten </PERSON>. It is n't so much that the four-ton <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> would n't mate with any of the bull elephants in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, but three weeks ago she broke a handler's collarbone with a slap of her trunk. `` From time to time, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> has made aggressive motions toward keepers she does n't like, and that's most of our keepers,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> zoo. `` We would n't fight the decision to let her go.'' The return has added urgency to the need to build bigger elephant barns, using money from a prior bond issue. Otherwise, <PERSON> Otten </PERSON> said, `` We'll have to go out of the elephant business.'' <PERSON> Moyo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thandi </PERSON>, the zoo's 8-year-old female African elephants, also could use larger quarters, <PERSON> Otten </PERSON> said. Part of the plan is for construction this summer of a special yard for <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> with an elephant `` crush,'' a hydraulic steel device to contain the animal while trainers trim toenails and tusks, administer medication and take blood and fluid samples. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> zoo does not have such a device, so trainers must rely on each other to keep elephants still.

 Trains loaded with snow have been rattling into this usually frozen capital in a costly battle to create the winter that was n't and save an annual tradition. A record warm winter threatened to melt away the <ORGANIZATION> Holmenkollen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ski </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, which begins Thursday, so organizers hauled in 5,600 tons of snow by rail at about 1.5 cents a pound to rescue the event. `` Snow costs about the same per pound as wholesale sugar,'' said <PERSON> Knut </PERSON> <PERSON> Almquist </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Promotion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Skiing </ORGANIZATION>, which has organized the annual festival since 1892. <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> experienced the mildest January ever recorded. State meteorologist <PERSON> Oernulf </PERSON> <PERSON> Fremming </PERSON> said January was a balmy 28 degrees above normal, and <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>'s February's average of 36.7 degrees was nearly 12 degrees warmer than the month's normal average temperature of 24.8 degrees. The nice weather has left the <LOCATION> Holmenkollen </LOCATION> ski jump and cross-country trail near <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> without snow as its annual highpoint approached _ four days of World Cup competitions that begin Thursday. Two of the week's major events, a World Cup 90-meter ski jump and the annual `` Monolith'' cross-country ski race in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Frogner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> have already been canceled. The state railroad <ORGANIZATION> NSB </ORGANIZATION> was hired to scoop up mountain snow from the center of the country and ship it 186 miles by flatcar to <LOCATION> Holmenkollen </LOCATION>. Railroaders joked that snow might be a important new cash crop. A giant <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinook </ORGANIZATION> twin-rotor helicopter had been slated to carry flakes aloft and create its own blizzard above <LOCATION> Holmenkollen </LOCATION>, but was grounded by fog, <PERSON> Almquist </PERSON> said. A lack of snow has not stopped <LOCATION> Holmenkollen </LOCATION> ski jumpers since 1925, and the association will do almost anything to save the event, he said. `` It would cost more to cancel than to ship snow. Our insurance pays for covering the ski area in snow but not for canceling or moving the event,'' he said of the more than $ 150,000 snow purchase. `` We'll take care of the snow if only nature will arrange the cold weather,'' he said. High temperatures and a steady drizzle had threatened to wash away transplanted snow _ but more recent colder weather and snow flurries have raised hopes, he said. Tuesday's high in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> was 41 degrees, the low 36. The warm spell has left <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>'s ski manufacturers, southern resorts and even the ski association strapped for cash but brought the railroad a windfall. `` We would n't mind seeing more ski races like this. It's great for business,'' joked Per <PERSON> Kristian </PERSON> <PERSON> Flaten </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NSB </ORGANIZATION>. `` We really do hope the jumps and races go as planned after everyone's efforts.'' <ORGANIZATION> NSB </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Olav </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollerud </PERSON>, who engineered the snow lift, said 13 trains have hauled 300 flatcars, each carrying 18.7 tons of snow, from the mountains.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did n't quite hit the lottery after resigning as education secretary last September, but he came close, more than quadrupling his assets by speaking and writing. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, nominated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to lead the government's war on illegal drugs, says he now has assets of $ 460,630. In contrast, a financial disclosure form submitted on his status as last Sept. 20 reflected assets ranging from $ 51,000 to $ 107,000. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says he has set aside $ 130,000 this year for federal income tax. According to financial statements <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he has cash on hand and in banks totaling $ 340,500 plus personal property worth $ 28,000, a savings plan worth $ 11,000 and a retirement annuity worth $ 81,000. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> opened confirmation hearings today on <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s nomination to be director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> earned almost $ 240,000 from 24 speaking engagements that brought him up to $ 14,000 per lecture, the statements show. In addition, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he has received $ 187,500 as an advance payment from <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> against royalties on two books he agreed to write in a contract signed last October. He is to receive $ 93,750 on delivery and acceptance of each of the two manuscripts, and he is to receive royalties on the books when they exceed the amount advanced to him, according to the statements. `` I plan to complete work on the first book before I enter government service,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, but he wo n't be able to write the second one, which was to be completed within a year after the first is done. That part of the contract is being renegotiated, but <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, refused to say Tuesday whether <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> planned to return any of the advance to <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster `` We're still in the process of renegotiating the contract,'' <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> said, adding that it should be completed by the end of the week. He said details of the new agreement would be filed with the Office of Government Ethics. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also earned $ 44,670 in salary from The <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a policy group that he created with $ 500,000 in start-up funds from The <PERSON> Lynde </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Harry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has agreed that if he is confirmed as drug director, he will disqualify himself from any matter involving <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Schuster, The <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Intrater </PERSON>, general counsel for the office of administration in the executive office of the president. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Elayne </PERSON>, works for a project housed at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> but funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s disclosure form. In addition, he has agreed to resign from numerous positions with non-profit foundations: president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, member of the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Freedoms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, as well as a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an adviser to the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the board of advisers for the Center for Security Policy. In 1988, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> earned $ 12,500 as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, $ 10,000 as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Aspen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1,250 as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>, director of the government ethics office, said in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, `` We believe that Mr. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing conflicts of interest.'' However, that was contingent on <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s agreement to resign from all outside positions and receive counseling from an ethics official to assure that he does not use government time and resources to complete his book or keep his former associations. The government ethics office did n't have much time to review the form. The office received the form last Friday and approved it the same day.

 About 40 people driven from their homes by a freight train wreck were allowed back early today, ending the second evacuation in two days. Investigators said speed, rough track and a faulty car may have been factors in the 21-car derailment Sunday in which two tankers containing 25,000 gallons of highly flammable butane caught fire and forced the evacuation of 2,000 people. Hours after residents were allowed back in their homes Tuesday, a tanker jumped the tracks again as it was being moved, causing no fire but prompting another evacuation that ended after the car was moved to a rail yard. Seven tankers are to be loaded onto flatbed cars later this week. `` It's wonderful to be back,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Graner </PERSON>, who returned to work today at a business near the second derailment site. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators said the city of 230,000 narrowly averted disaster in the <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> derailment and explosion next to a <ORGANIZATION> B.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goodrich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> chemical plant. Chemicals stored outside the plant in large tanks and piped into the building include highly flammable butadiene and styrene as well as acrylonitrile, which can produce toxic fumes, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` That's one of the reasons for the high level of safety board response to this situation, because the potential for a catastrophic accident did exist here,'' he said. The safety board found `` some rough track conditions and alignment difficulties'' on the tracks, which are owned and maintained by <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> and were last inspected by the railroad on Feb. 23, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. The tracks next to the <PERSON> Goodrich </PERSON> plant had a speed limit of 40 mph, while tapes from the train place its speed at 43 or 44 mph, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. He said the train crew reported it was going 39 mph when the accident occurred. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, asked if the train may have been going at an unsafe speed, said, `` If the speed limit is 40 miles per hour, which it was, and the speed tape says 43 or 44, you can conclude that. It's like a highway.'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said the engineer, conductor and two brakemen were tested for alcohol or drug use. The tests were sent to a lab for analysis. He said investigators are also studying whether a hopper car that carried sand may have played a role. It had 2 -LCB- inches of excess lateral movement, which <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said `` is more than good maintenance practice would deem ideal.'' He added, `` We understand that this car was subject to some major maintenance in October of last year and this was only the second trip made with that car since then.''

 As any prosecutor can tell you, there are rats and snakes in the public defender's office. A plan to exterminate the rodents, rabbits and reptiles that burrow inside the trailer-office from a nearby field has backfired, with the animals dying in the walls and floorboards and the lawyers scurrying away. `` The place had become very malodorous,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, chief deputy public defender. `` It stunk.'' Unable to work any longer, the lawyers, investigators and secretaries sought temporary office space in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Municipal courthouse, a situation that created some problems with attorney-client privacy. The county is paying $ 4,000 a day to hire outside attorneys to handle misdemeanor cases because the public defenders have no place private to speak with clients. Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Iles </PERSON> said she does n't blame the public defenders. `` When we were pulling a dead rat a week out of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defender </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> it got to be too much,'' Ms. <PERSON> Iles </PERSON> said. County officials agreed the trailer is uninhabitable and said they're working to find new office space as soon as possible.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new law passed by the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to fight the city's soaring crime rate would impose a curfew of 11 p.m. on weekdays and midnight on weekends for people under 18 years of age. The temporary measure passed Tuesday would allow police to detain violators at police stations until a parent or guardian signs for their release. Those not picked up would be held until 6 a.m. the next day. The measure, introduced as emergency legislation by council member <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, calls for fining parents and guardians of repeat offenders $ 100 to $ 500. Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has 10 days to sign the bill, which would put it into effect immediately, or veto the measure. He has taken no public position on it. City Corporation Counsel <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said his office would study the legislation thoroughly before advising the mayor whether or not to sign it. If approved, the curfew would expire after 90 days unless permanent legislation is enacted. It would exempt young people engaged in `` specific business or activity'' related to `` legitimate employment'' after the curfew hours, but they would have to obtain an affadavit signed by a parent or guardian and an employer. Some police officers said the curfew would be difficult to enforce and would add to patrol officers' overburdened workload.

 Venezuelans stood in long lines outside the few open food stores today after two days of rioting that left scores of people dead. The government told people to resign themselves to a new way of life. The nation woke up under martial law, imposed late Tuesday by President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> after the country's worst violence in 31 years of <ORGANIZATION> democratic </ORGANIZATION> rule. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> also imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew, which government spokesman Pastor <PERSON> Heydra </PERSON> said would last until peace had been restored to the country. Citizens were prohibited from gathering in public places or protesting publicly. Rights to privacy and freedom of the press were suspended, and the military was given the right to detain anyone on sight. `` I think Venezuelans should take this time to reflect on the fact that <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> is a different country now, and we have to learn different consumption habits and behavior habits,'' said <PERSON> Heydra </PERSON>. Reports from authorities and independent sources indicated the death toll had surpassed 100 in violence touched off by protests over price increases imposed to meet the demands of international creditors. The <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said today 80 people died in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. At least 800 people were injured in what <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> termed an `` incredible tragedy.'' At least eight cities were placed under military control. Authorities said thousands of people had been arrested. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, in office since Feb. 2, said in a television address Tuesday night the riots were threatening the democratic process. Even as he spoke, gunfire was heard in the streets, and rioting and looting continued in this capital of 4 million. In the eastern shantytown of <LOCATION> Petare </LOCATION>, 17 people were killed in battles between police and rioters. Victims were carried down from the hills to be taken to hospitals while crowds watched, witnesses said. Later Tuesday, the army moved into <LOCATION> Petare </LOCATION> and the hills of January 23, a lower-income neighborhood on the west side of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, to take on snipers. Authorities said army units completed their search before dawn but did not elaborate. Residents of the Palo Verde and <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> areas, both near <LOCATION> Petare </LOCATION>, said they experienced `` hours of terror'' as pistol-armed mobs came down the hills by the hundreds, sacked grocery stores and a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> restaurant, burning its furniture on the street before the army intervened. `` I saw angry mobs shout at an army unit of approximately 200, ` We prefer to be killed by bullets than to die from starvation.' Then shots started and I saw three fall dead. People covered the corpses with blankets,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Prado </PERSON> said that from his 12th floor apartment he saw 45 minutes of `` shooting between the submachine gun-armed unit and the mobs, which shot pistols and rifles. It was a real war.'' In nearby <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urbina </ORGANIZATION>, another mob tried to sack a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant `` The army took action just in time because the place was full of housewives and children,'' said resident <PERSON> Reinaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>. The capital looked like a ghost town, with only ambulances and specially authorized vehicles operating. Army units stood at downtown corners. The riots exploded Monday over increases in bus fares and gasoline prices, announced in a recent economic package that includes higher prices for food and basic items. Violence began in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> and rapidly spread to other cities. The measures, announced two weeks ago, were required by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> before it would grant $ 1.5 billion in badly needed credit. The country's foreign debt stands at $ 33 billion. Since 1958, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> has been one of the most politically stable countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In recent years, however, its oil-based economy has been in a deep recession. Inflation is expected to surpass 70 percent this year, up from 35 percent last year. Policemen in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> fired shotguns and tear gas for a second day Tuesday to disperse crowds trying to gather in grocery stores. Metropolitan Police Inspector <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolivar </PERSON> said `` rioters are better-armed than we are. They have rifles, pistols, revolvers, even submachine guns out there.'' A police commissioner was among those shot to death Tuesday. One witness said looters carried 50 cow carcasses from a butcher shop. Residents sacked and burned one of the city's largest shopping centers in the wealthy suburb of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>. It was `` collective madness ... Some people brought cars and station wagons to carry things away,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> reporter said.

<HEAD>Singer Deletes ``Allah'' Song From Repertoire Following Threats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 French singer <PERSON> Veronique </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanson </PERSON> has withdrawn a pop song entitled `` Allah'' from her repertoire following bomb threats to the concert hall where she is performing. `` We made this decision ... after having received sufficient threats to make us not want to run useless risks,'' the singer's spokesman, <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Domboy </PERSON>, said today None of the callers to the theater identified themselves, <PERSON> Domboy </PERSON> said. `` I received frightful threats,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sanson </PERSON> said in a radio interview following her opening performance Tuesday night at Olympia music hall. She said callers said they would place bombs in the concert hall and threatened to kill her and the musicians. Authorities had no comment about the reported threats. The incident comes amid controversy over the novel `` The Satanic Verses'' and Iranian threats to kill its author, <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>. Many Moslems say the novel is blasphemous. Interior Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Joxe </PERSON> has said security precautions have been taken since Iranian leader <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s death on Feb. 14. <PERSON> Joxe </PERSON> did not elaborate. Publisher <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourgois </PERSON>, which will publish the French version of <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, is known to be under protection along with three newspapers and weeklies that have published extracts. Ms. <PERSON> Sanson </PERSON> defended her song, a plaintive refrain about war and misery. `` ` Allah' is absolutely not an insult, either for Islam or the name of Allah,'' she said. `` It is, rather, a song of prayer and love.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, in an interview published today, called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` useless'' and said Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> `` belong to the same family of demagogues and totalitarians.'' If <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> did on a 1977 peace mission, `` we'd put him in prison,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Interviewed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Arnaud </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchgrave </PERSON>, the Times' editor-in-chief, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader called King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, with whom he has offered to negotiate terms for an Arab-Israeli settlement, an `` element of stability'' in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> But, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, if a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is to be established it should be located on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s kingdom stands. `` If the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> population one day decides to have a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state there, it's up to them,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> does not provide precise population figures it is believed to be at least 70 percent Palestinian. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, meanwhile, which <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> ruled from 1947 until the territory was captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war, has nearly 1 million Palestinians and about 60,000 Jews. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> took a tough stand on these issues as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration ponders its policy toward the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, who is also a hard-liner, is due here for talks in two weeks with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Ending a 13-year ban, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> last December, over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s objections. There have been five meetings so far in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> maintains its headquarters. Asked by the Times editor if the dialogue is a bad idea, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` I think it's useless. Not healthy because it gives the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> more prestige and importance, and in such a way that it discourages moderate elements who would like to find a path to real peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said there were many moderate elements among the Palestinians. `` But when they see the Americans talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, they can not muster the courage to do anything else,'' he said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> were based on a judgment by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had renounced terrorism, accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and subscribed to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions upholding the right of all states in the area to live within secure borders. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not detect any change in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s attitude. `` History is replete with such phenomena who, after a while, disappear when they have outlived their usefulness,'' he said. `` Take <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. There was a time in the 1930s when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was celebrated the world over as some kind of savior. The end we know. But the price was a very heavy one.'' Asked if he were drawing a parallel between <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader replied: `` They belong to the same family of demagogues and totalitarians, enemies of the Jewish people, men who think nothing of killing millions to achieve their objectives.''

Opponents complained that downtown has been improved at the expense of neighborhoods and basic city services. <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, who served in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the 1970s, organized a recall effort because of disgust over back-to-back tax increases.

<HEAD>Personal Income Up 1.8 Percent In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal income shot up 1.8 percent in January, the biggest increase in more than a year, while the pace of consumer spending was nearly flat after a strong gain in December, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said income rose $ 74 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.28 trillion in January, following a 0.9 percent increase in December and a 0.2 percent drop in November. January's income gain was the biggest monthly increase since a 2 percent jump in October 1987. Personal consumption spending, meanwhile, edged up just 0.1 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 3.35 trillion, following a 0.8 percent gain in December and a 0.4 percent jump during November. The figures include virtually all consumer spending except interest payments on debt. January's 0.1 percent increase was the weakest performance for consumer spending since a 1.5 percent decrease last September. A slowdown in consumer spending would be welcome news because of worries that demand has been outstripping the production capabilities of factories coping with high operating rates and tight labor markets. The increase in income was paced by a 1.2 percent gain in the key component of wages and salaries, reflecting continued strong employment. The recent income gains were bolstered by several special factors, including a 4.1 percent pay raise in January for federal civilian and military personnel, a 4 percent cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits in January, and a December increase in farm subsidy payments, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. But even excluding such special factors, personal income still increased 1.6 percent in January and 0.8 percent in December. Americans' disposable, or after-tax, incomes rose 1.7 percent in January, after rising 0.9 percent in December and falling 0.3 percent in November. With the income gain strongly outpacing the rise in spending, the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, rose to 5.8 percent from 4.3 percent in December. Spending was held back by a 3 percent decrease in spending on durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last at least three years. Purchases of services, which includes housing costs, were up 0.5 percent. Purchases of non-durable goods rose 0.9 percent.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Up 0.4 Percent in January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Construction spending rose 0.4 percent in January, led by a strong increase in work on non-residential projects such as factories, offices and motels, the government said today. Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 424 billion in January, following a 2.1 percent increase in December and a 1.3 percent jump in November. January's 0.4 percent increase was the weakest performance since a 0.3 percent rise last October. Rising interest rates have dampened activity in most sectors, with fixed-rate mortgages averaging 10.78 percent last week compared with 9.87 percent a year earlier. In January, residential construction rose 1.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 204.6 billion, reflecting an unchanged pace of building activity on single-family homes and a 3.7 percent gain in apartment construction. Apartment construction generally has been sluggish in recent months, held back by high vacancy rates and reduced tax incentives for investment in such projects. The category had declined 0.9 percent in December. Non-residential construction, meanwhile, rose 4.3 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 99.1 billion. Hotel and motel building was up 8.7 percent and factory construction rose 7.3 percent. Activity in the industrial sector has been bolstered over the past year as manufacturers expanded capacity to meet rising demand generated by strong export sales, although the pace of exports slowed during the last quarter of 1988. Construction of office buildings was up 2.2 percent during January, while work on religious facilities rose 11.1 percent and other commercial projects increased 5 percent. Government construction, meanwhile, declined 4.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 81.7 billion. The largest category for government construction, highways and streets, was down 10 percent.

<TEXT>
 The government has commuted the death sentences of 16 prisoners, including an activist who was the subject of clemency appeals from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said today. The reprieves were hailed by human rights organizations as an indication the government might be heeding widespread criticism of the frequent use of capital punishment. There were 164 hangings in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in 1987 and 117 in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> gave no explanation for the action, merely listing the 16 prisoners granted clemency. In each case, the death sentence was commuted to a prison term, ranging from 10 years to life. A ministry spokeswoman, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pienaar </PERSON>, said the affected prisoners included one mixed-race man and 15 blacks, among them <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Setlaba </PERSON>, who was convicted of committing murder during a 1985 black consumer boycott. The ministry said the sentences were commuted by `` the state president.'' But it was not immediately clear if that referred to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who is recovering from a stroke, or his replacement, acting President <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Setlaba </PERSON>'s execution was stayed by Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> in November, hours before he was to be hanged. The stay followed appeals for clemency by human rights groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which depicted <PERSON> Setlaba </PERSON> as an anti-apartheid activist caught up in political unrest. Details of the other reprieved prisoners' cases were not disclosed. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Currin </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> organization, commended the government for granting the reprieves. He also said he was heartened that only two people had been executed so far this year, compared to a monthly average of more than 10 in recent years. `` These statistics, together with the 16 clemencies, give us hope that the state is beginning to appreciate the need to review those laws in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that have resulted in the execution of so many people,'' he said. <PERSON> Currin </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Setlaba </PERSON>'s last-minute stay was issued by <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> after a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge had rejected an application for a stay. The judge had asserted that there was no prospect of clemency for <LOCATION> Setlaba </LOCATION>. The Black Sash civil rights group also commended the reprieves but reiterated its call for a moratorium on all hangings while experts consider the possible abolition of the death penalty.

 A federal appeals court has ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to reopen licensing hearings for a nuclear power plant 25 miles from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> because the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> disregarded safety modifications. An opponent of the <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> plant hailed Tuesday's ruling by the <ORGANIZATION> 3rd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The court said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to consider safety design alternatives could have affected the decision in 1985 to grant a full-power operating license to <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. Spokesmen for <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the effect of the ruling. But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, an attorney for plant opponent <ORGANIZATION> Limerick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling forces the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> to reopen the licensing procedure. `` It certainly sets a precedent. It says that the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> can no longer violate the National Environmental Policy Act by refusing to consider safer reactor designs. There is now no excuse for <ORGANIZATION> PECO </ORGANIZATION> not to implement design changes to reduce accident risk,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> plant, which went on line at full power in 1985, is one of three operating in the country within 50 miles of a major metropolitan area. <ORGANIZATION> Limerick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> had challenged the plant's licensing in a lawsuit in 1987. The challenge to the <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> license was supported by the state and the national Union of Concerned Scientists in friend-of-the-court briefs. `` We feel it's a big victory,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Limerick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>. `` Not only will it help us, it helps other cases around the country.''

 Leftist guerrillas today attacked the main garrison of the easternmost province of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, ignoring an army cease-fire and pleas to end the 9-year-old civil war. Rebels late Tuesday also attacked a coffee processing plant that local radio stations said belonged to the presidential candidate of the rightist party favored to win elections scheduled this month. Insurgents of the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said they killed 67 soldiers and wounded 25 in the attack on the military detachment in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, 110 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The rebel report, broadcast on a clandestine radio station, appeared to be greatly exaggerated. A military source, commenting on condition of anonymity, said defenders of the detachment suffered `` some casualties'' but `` not many.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in a preliminary report, said two guerrillas and one civilian were killed in the two-hour attack on the garrison. The rebels also struck the Mecafe coffee processing plant outside <LOCATION> Nejapa </LOCATION>, six miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. A spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Nejapa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> post, contacted by telephone, said the installation, which dries and bags coffee beans, was completely destroyed by explosive charges detonated by the rebels. About 20 soldiers stationed at the plant battled the attackers briefly before retreating, said the spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity. He said no casualties were reported. Radio stations said the plant is the property of <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, presidential candidate of <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. The report could not be immediately confirmed. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is favored to win the presidential election scheduled for March 19. Arena has refused rebel demands to postpone the elections. The military had said it would halt attacks at midnight and had urged the guerrillas _ who are trying to negotiate participation in national elections _ to also cease hostilities. The military announced the three-month halt in offensive operations after the rebels offered to declare a unilateral cease-fire of their own to help facilitate direct peace talks with President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. However, the rebels rejected in their communique both the agenda and venue for the talks that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> called for on Sunday. The armed forces said in a statement that the cease-fire took hold at midnight Tuesday and would last until June 1, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s last day in office. It did not say whether the military would abide by the truce if the guerrillas kept up their attacks. On Jan. 24, the rebels offered to take part in and respect the results of the presidential vote if it was postponed several months. They have boycotted the decade's five previous national elections. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> had called for a three-month cease-fire and for talks on ending the civil war to begin Tuesday in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. He also said he favored holding the presidential vote on April 30. The rebels rejected the site, saying talks should be Saturday and Sunday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. They also balked at an unilateral cease-fire, insisting a lasting truce should be part of the negotiations. An estimated 70,000 people have been killed and 500,000 to 1 million people displaced during the civil war.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government has slashed defense spending and diverted funds to fight hunger, illiteracy and provide homes for the homeless. The unprecedented reduction in defense spending was contained in the government's budget for 1989-90, introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shankarrao </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government reacted to criticism that it is oriented toward the rich by pledging to reduce official expenditures and slapping new levies on cars, televisions, electronic goods, air travel and hotel tariffs. Analysts said the budget was aimed at wooing the electorate, most of them the rural poor. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> came to power in 1984 after the assassination of his mother and predecessor, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. Under Indian law he is required to call national elections by the end of the year. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> will spend 2 billion rupees -LRB- $ 133 million -RRB- less on defense in the 1989-90 fiscal year compared to the previous year's expenses, <PERSON> Chavan </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s armed forces, with the sixth largest army in the world, has 1.3 million soldiers. The budget proposal calls for total spending of 821.6 billion rupees -LRB- $ 54.7 billion -RRB- in the 1989-90 fiscal year, which runs from April 1 through March 31. In 1988-89, the total budget was 735.6 billion rupees -LRB- $ 56.6 billion. -RRB- In February 1988, the exchange rate was an estimated 12 rupees to $ 1. The current rate is 15 rupees to $ 1. <PERSON> Chavan </PERSON> pledged to spend 17 billion rupees -LRB- $ 1.1 billion -RRB- on programs to fight hunger, illiteracy and provide housing for the homeless. The amount is up by 5 billion rupees -LRB- $ 333 million -RRB- from last year. The increased funds for such programs will be raised directly from taxing the upper-middle classes, including an 8 percent surcharge on annual incomes of more than 50,000 rupees or -LRB- $ 3,333 -RRB-. Government estimates for March 1988 indicate that 16.5 million families, defined as a unit of five people, need housing in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, meaning that 82.5 million people are considered homeless. <PERSON> Chavan </PERSON> said the nation was proud of the armed forces for bringing `` credit to our country when called upon to help other countries in their hour of need.'' But he added: `` All of us recognize that there is continuing need for implementing measures for greater cost effectiveness.'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is spending 24 million rupees -LRB- $ 1.6 million -RRB- a day to maintain 40,000 troops in neighboring <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. They have been stationed there since 1987 to enforce a peace accord aimed at ending the 5-year-old Tamil separatist war. Besides maintaining its armed forces on the frontiers with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> is spending a huge amount to keep its control over a Himalayan glacial ridge on the borders with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The 50-mile-long Siachen glacier, the longest in the <LOCATION> Himalayas </LOCATION>, is strategic because it overlooks <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and Indian military concentrations in the valleys nearby. There have been a series of confrontations on the glacier since 1983. But the skirmishes escalated into a major clash in September 1987, followed by several more clashes.

True, some people who drink too much just up and quit. But many others need treatment. And the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> ca n't assume that a guy with a drinking problem will stop just because he says he will. ... It's too late for Tower to take back his promise. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should n't be moved by it. What matters is the evidence. If it shows that Tower's drinking, or his recent work for prominent defense contractors, would intefere with his duties, he should not be confirmed.

But defense is getting an inflation adjustment of $ 10.2 billion while the domestic programs are being held to the same dollar amounts as in the current budget year.

 Feb. 27 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Express-News on single-parent children: Bad news from the Census Bureau: The number of single-parent households is up sharply since 1980, continuing a trend that goes back three decades. More than 15 million <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children now live apart from their mother or father. In 1960, only 7 percent of white children and 22 percent of black were so labeled. In 1988, the figures were 19 percent and 54 percent, respectively. Thus an absolute majority of black children are now being raised by a single parent. No government program can substitute for the economic and moral benefits of growing up in a family with loving, authoritative role models of both sexes. Until our culture finds a way to reverse the collapse of such families, welfare dependency will continue to perpetuate itself.

Others say the 8-foot-deep, 14-foot-wide ditch is intended to block what is said to be the most popular route used by drug smugglers and illegal aliens to drive across the border. ... There is a problem of drug trafficking and illegal entry across our southern border. ... It is time for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to acknowledge that the long-term solution to the border conflict lies not in more conflict but in understanding and economic assistance _ in building fences, not barriers.

 Feb. 27 The Evening Sun, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, on John Tower: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> ... promises he will quit drinking if he is confirmed -LRB- as defense secretary -RRB-. ... But under the present circumstances, taking the pledge begins to resemble a man who, about to be thrown out of the house, desperately promises his wife, `` I'll never take another drink!'' But even if the no-drinking pledge is helpful, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> points out that a bad odor still hovers over Tower because of his relations with defense contractors, whom he served at great profit after leaving the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. Tower maintains his consulting business violated neither law nor propriety. Dozens of other former lawmakers and bureaucrats, Tower points out, have become consultants. But in the arcane world of national security, secrecy is the critical edge of advantage. Even if he betrayed no secrets to defense contractors, Tower unquestionably relied on his knowledge of those secrets in giving the advice for which he was so handsomely paid.

 Feb. 28 The <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal on John Tower: <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>'s pledge to swear off alcohol if he is approved as secretary of defense is no justification for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to confirm his nomination. If he does still have a serious drinking problem, this pledge ... is not enough. He would need rehabilitation. ... Even more troubling, however, are the potential conflicts of interest involving Tower's dealings with defense contractors. He left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> as an arms negotiator in 1984 to become a highly paid consultant. Even though he reportedly did not violate any laws in his consulting business, he profited handsomely from his willingness to trade on his government position and his knowledge of government secrets. ... <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has been a terrible nominee from the start. A more thorough <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation should have uncovered that. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the body that would have to work closest with Tower _ was absolutely right in rejecting his nomination after its long and thoughtful hearings.

The study ... reported that Caesarean operations ... climbed to a new high for a 12th straight year. The ... group states that the use of Caesarean sections, rather than normal labor, can increase the risk of death or illness for mothers, substantially raise the cost of having a baby and exact a `` psychological toll'' on the mother. The C-section procedure of cutting through the abdomen and uterus to deliver the baby averages more than $ 3,000 above the cost of vaginal deliveries. If the medical profession can not discipline its members against unnecessary, dangerous and money-grabbing surgery, the undesirable alternative for society may well be to invite government surveillance and control of the profession.

After he left the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Tower became a consultant to the defense industry. In a couple of years he had received around a million dollars in consulting fees from defense contractors. He and defense contractors get along very, very well. This is the man who is supposed to go before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and make credible, plausible arguments as to why we need this weapon or that defense system, or why we should pay so much more money for this project?

 The General Assembly today approved $ 416 million for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mission to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> from 74 years of South African rule. On April 1, the world body plans to begin implementing a one-year plan to create the world's newest independent nation, in the process settling the last major colonial problem in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since World War I, when it captured the former German colony. In December, <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> finally agreed to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s one-year plan to make the territory a sovereign state. The General Assembly was able to clear the last hurdle to implementing the plan after its budget subcommittee, overriding objections from several African nations, decided Tuesday night that <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> may buy goods from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as long as it continues to be the cheapest supplier. Countries led by <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> had delayed approval of the assessment for the force by trying to make the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> heed its own calls for trade embargoes on South African products. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opposed the restrictions on purchases for the force, citing the higher cost of buying goods and services elsewhere that are available from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Late Tuesday, the assembly's budget committee adopted language that noted the embargoes but called on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to buy from the lowest bidder among the `` widest possible sources of procurement'' in the interest of `` economy and efficiency.'' A dejected Zambian Ambassador <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingiswayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuze </PERSON> said he viewed the compromise as the `` best as can be.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> fiscal controller <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maris </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> pledged that the world body would not buy helicopters from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, as the black African states had feared. He said peacekeeping troops would bring their own military vehicles, but mine-resistant vehicles would be needed in the early stage of the mission, and these would likely be leased from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials noted that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is readily able to supply the $ 10.2 million in gasoline and aviation fuel the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> force will need. The black African states had proposed that fuel be bought from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION> _ a more expensive proposition. In December, the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> had clashed with the black African states over the size and cost of the mission. The Africans wanted 7,500 peacekeepers sent, at a cost of up to $ 700 million. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> instead adopted the Big Five plan of sending just 4,650 personnel, with the rest held in reserve. The Big Five _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> _ pay 57 percent of all peacekeeping costs. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mission in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is to oversee November parliamentary elections in the territory also known as <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to grant <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> independence as part of an accords signed in December that also call for the withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops who have aided that country's Marxist government in a 14-year-old war against South African-supported rebels.

 An <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> wildfire moved away from a major interstate power line today after firefighters in a helicopter dropped incendiary bombs the size of ping-pong balls to create a buffer in the drought-parched region. Downpours that drenched parts of the southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast Tuesday brought only a few light showers to the fire zone, but optimism grew today with more rain in the forecast. `` We're probably in better shape than we have been all week,'' forestry division spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitson </PERSON> said. `` It looks like we've got some moisture coming into the state right now, and things have cooled down considerably. Fanned by steady 10 mph winds, the 3-day-old blaze burned an estimated 12,000 acres before stalling at a drainage canal at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> line northwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> early this morning, forestry officials said. Thick smoke from burning resins in sawgrass and melaleuca trees forced the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> to close eight miles of highway for about an hour Tuesday, and prompted complaints from as far as 30 miles away in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, state forestry spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> said. Firefighters dropped incendiary bombs from a helicopter to start backfires designed to keep the 10-mile-long wall of flame away from interstate power lines serving more than 3 million <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> residents. <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> shut off power on the three 500,000-volt lines for four hours during Tuesday's operation. No blackouts were reported. In 1985, a fire that burned more than 100,000 acres engulfed power lines and caused widespread blackouts in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Today, forestry officials on the western side of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> contained a 4,050-acre fire that burned through cypress and palmetto-dotted scrubland, duty officer <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. Officials planned to use incendiary bombs on the blaze later today to burn remaining fuel. That blaze was stalled just south of <LOCATION> Alligator </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION>, a two-lane highway connecting <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> to the Gulf coast, said <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> forestry officer <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The two wildfires were the largest of more than 65 fires the forestry division has fought since Monday with about 400 firefighters, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON>, spokesman for the agency in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. Tuesday's rainfall caused flooding that closed the main runway at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale-Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for two hours. The rain also caused a rush-hour mudslide onto Interstate 95 that backed traffic up for six miles. But little of it hit wilderness areas, where rainfall has averaged less than half normal levels since last fall. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecast scattered showers in some parts of the state over the next few days, but nothing that would alleviate the growing fire danger, <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> today banned hazardous waste shipments from 32 states and <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> that have not begun creating their own dumps. `` As trucks that come from an area that's banned ... we're going to turn the truck back and, if at all possible, escort them back to the state line,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Culler </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. The ban applied to a commercial landfill operated here by <ORGANIZATION> GSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. It is one of only two commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast. Most landfill customers had been notified of the ban, but the department increased the number of inspectors monitoring the landfill from three to 10 today to watch for unexpected loads from banned states, <PERSON> Culler </PERSON> said. `` It will have a tremendous impact on our business,'' GSX Vice President <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` We just think it's a good business decision not to challenge it.'' The ban, announced Tuesday, affects such heavy landfill users as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. It results from Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s Jan. 18 executive order that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> would prohibit, beginning March 1, the disposal of waste from any state that refused to dispose of the waste itself. `` We hope our actions will encourage other states to move toward developing their own hazardous waste management programs,'' said <PERSON> Hartsill </PERSON> <PERSON> Truesdale </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>'s hazardous waste division. `` It was both the failure of other states to aggressively address their waste disposal problems and the growing imbalance in waste disposal that prompted Governor <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> to issue this executive order.'' The massive GSX landfill on the shore of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION> annually accepts 135,000 tons of hazardous waste, such as solvents, acids and other chemical garbage. About 70 percent comes from out of state. The other hazardous waste landfill in the Southeast is in <LOCATION> Emelle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. The governor's spokesman, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> <PERSON> Eskew </PERSON>, said he believed <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>'s message to other states would come across: `` If it's not good enough for you, it's not good enough for us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> has said that any state would have to remove disposal prohibitions before the ban could be lifted. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> responded to the ban with the introduction of a bill Tuesday that renews that state's search for a hazardous waste treatment plant, though it fails to specify when a site would be chosen. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> state Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON>, a longtime landfill opponent, said other states should have working disposal sites before being allowed to send <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> their waste. `` Anybody that promises us that with a little revision of a law that their state is soon going to be handling its own hazardous waste is simply telling us the check is in the mail,'' <PERSON> Leventis </PERSON> said. The banned states shipped about 45 percent of the waste handled by the dump in 1987, according to the latest figures available. In addition to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the following states are affected by the ban: <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

 Immigration agents today took into custody 27 more suspected illegal aliens on a flight bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, bringing to 175 the number seized in a three-day crackdown on alien smuggling rings. Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, whose jurisdiction includes <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, said the 27 were on a <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. The 27, who are from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, were taken off the plane during a stopover here at 6:40 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said. They had flown to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> on an <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> late Tuesday, officials said. `` An irate citizen called our office -LRB- Tuesday -RRB- morning and claimed to be a commuter aboard the <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flight,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, supervisory <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. `` The source suggested we check Flight 1522.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the aliens caught today apparently paid $ 2,000 apiece for the trip, which he described as part of a `` massive smuggling ring.'' `` <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is literally saturated with aliens,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> director for investigations in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` The word has spread that <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> is not the place to obtain employment.'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said this was the third time <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents had apprehended illegal aliens on the <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flight. Fifteen people were caught in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> on Oct. 6, and 17 more Oct. 12, he said. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents apprehended 79 suspected illegal aliens aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> that stops in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> en route from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sixty-nine more aliens were taken into custody in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Monday night as they attempted to board the same flight. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said a man believed to be a leader of a smuggling ring _ <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman-Romero </PERSON>, a 42-year-old Mexican _ was arrested along with the 69 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Immigration officials stressed that several independent smugglers may have been using <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s `` red eye'' Flight 80 to ferry illegal aliens to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and that the group arrested in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> was not necessarily linked to those seized in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` This was a concurrent, parallel investigation that will continue until we close this route. We suspect there will be other routes,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Looney </PERSON>, acting district director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. Authorities said the chief smuggling operators remain at large, but they described <PERSON> Guzman-Romero </PERSON> as a leader. `` We're not as close as we'd like to be. We'd like to have -LRB- the ringleaders -RRB- in handcuffs,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> assistant district director for anti-smuggling. <PERSON> Guzman-Romero </PERSON> was charged with transporting at least three illegal aliens. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Volney </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> declined to set bail Tuesday, saying Guzman-Romero has no ties to the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said investigators received tips that several groups used <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s late-night flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We feel like we have a number of individual smugglers who are utilizing a rather low airfare to move their aliens away from the border from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and on up to the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said at a news conference. Smugglers often appear early at the ticket counter and pay cash for a block of tickets, officials said. The 69 aliens caught in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> allegedly paid up to $ 4,000 for a package that probably included crossing the border, passage to a drop house and the cross-country flight, <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> said. He said he did n't know if the package included finding employment. Fifty-four were from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, seven from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and four each from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Looney </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanders </PERSON> said most of the people, if found to be illegal aliens, would be given the choice of going home or requesting a deportation hearing. He said some might be held as material witnesses. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said thousands of illegal aliens may have been shuttled across the country on the Eastern flight nearly every day for the past 30 days. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> refused to speculate on how many illegal aliens may have used the flights but said the technique is not new, recalling at least one sweep in recent years that netted 200 people. Both <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Looney </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> was not a target of the investigation. Eastern cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> arrests, officials said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s electronic alarm system along its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> will be dismantled by January 1991, partly because of too many false alarms, official reports said Wednesday. A report submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s Politburo said guarding the borders poses a growing burden for guards `` thanks to the fact that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ties with the world have expanded,'' the government news agency reported. In an interview published in the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>, the commander of the western <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> border zone, said the guards `` wholeheartedly support the initiative ... it is an outdated system.'' Col <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Franko </PERSON> quoted the guards as saying the technical warning system posed `` a physical and mental stress for them.'' <PERSON> Franko </PERSON> said that in the Sopron border region alone, 4,374 alarms were registered last year, of which only 44 were actual border violations. Ninety-three percent of the violations were committed by foreign citizens, mainly East Germans heading for <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A trial began Wednesday for 253 people charged with insurrection during the reign of leftist terror in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> during the 1970s and early 1980s. Several defendants, including noted <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> members such as <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Balzerani </PERSON>, were convicted in the 1978 kidnapping and murder of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moro </PERSON>. Another noted defendant is <PERSON> Renato </PERSON> <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> during the height of its activity. If convicted on charges of insurrection and civil war, the defendents face sentences of life imprisonment. About 40 defendants watched the opening proceedings from inside steel-barred cages. Another 40 who are jailed refused to attend the proceedings, exercising their right under Italian law to skip their own trial. Many have renounced terrorism, but some vowed from their courtroom cells to support `` the struggle of comrades in the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION>'' _ the West German-based leftist terrorist movement. The Italian government says it has practically eradicated left-wing terrorist activity. However, terrorists have carried out spectacular crimes in recent years, including the 1988 slaying of an Italian senator at his home.

 A court has acquitted two missionaries from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on charges of proselytizing, and they said after spending four months in prison awaiting trial that they want to leave the Hindu kingdom as soon as possible. `` We've had enough of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. `` We are going to go home.'' <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, were acquitted Tuesday on charges of preaching Christianity and causing a disturbance to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, 26, arrived Wednesday in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> from the town of <LOCATION> Phidim </LOCATION>, 150 miles to the east, where they were arrested Oct. 27 at the end of a five-week trek of the Himalayan foothills. They were arrested on charges of proselytizing, punishable by up to six years in prison. The constitution declares that <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> is a Hindu state, and the law bans conversion from <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> to another religion. <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> and <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> had pleaded innocent. The court ordered them held because Nepalese law does not permit bail for foreigners who face sentences of more than six months. Police had confiscated books on Christianity in the Nepali, <LOCATION> Limbu </LOCATION>, Sherpa, Tibetan, English and German languages, as well as cassette tapes they allegedly sold during their trek. Justice <PERSON> Ek </PERSON> <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Acharya </PERSON> acquitted them because of lack of evidence. <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Connie </PERSON>, embraced him after he arrived by plane in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>. `` For me ... it is a miracle that they are released,'' she said. `` I am happy to be out,'' <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> said. `` But there are a lot of people that need to be out of that jail, too.'' He said at least two-thirds of the 46 others in the prison were innocent, `` at least that is what I think from my conversations with them. They are not guilty but they have staying longer than me ... Some of them ca n't afford lawyers. Some of them just stay there.'' <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> and <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> were affiliated with the Operation Mobilization, a London-based Christian organization. An official with the organization, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakely </PERSON>, said the two had received 2,000 cards and letters from all over the world while in jail. On Tuesday alone, he said, they received 243 letters. Their 90-day visas expired while they were in prison, but officials were working to clear the paperwork so they could leave <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. `` This will be just a formality. ... They would be free to go -LRB- home -RRB-,'' according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Last month, three Hindus who converted to Christianity were sentenced to one year in prison by a court in <LOCATION> Bhadrapur </LOCATION>, 190 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, a Nepalese news agency reported.

 Authorities today searched for a paroled killer suspected of shooting to death an undercover federal drug agent in the officer's car. <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 46, was shot three times _ in the eye, ear and shoulder _ on a dead-end street in a remote area on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on Tuesday night, police sources and the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. A backup surveillance team found the agent dead minutes after the shooting, which neighbors reported hearing. The slaying was the first of a federal drug agent in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area in more than a decade. The agent, assigned to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> DEA office, had gone there to meet <PERSON> Constible </PERSON> <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, a 28-year-old New Yorker from whom he had bought drugs before, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strang </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office The agent had not gone to buy drugs and was not carrying money or drugs, <PERSON> Strang </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Strang </PERSON> said authorities believe <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> showed up at the meeting, and he said the man is a suspect in the slaying. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and police were searching for him. `` We believe he's on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Strang </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, whose street name is <PERSON> Gus </PERSON>, had been released from prison in <LOCATION> Elmira </LOCATION> in 1988 after serving nine years for manslaughter, said police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. He was on parole until 2002, the sources said. Asked whether the agent's cover might have been blown, <PERSON> Strang </PERSON> answered: `` At this point we're not speculating anything. Anything is possible.'' `` His window was down, his foot was on the brake and it appeared as if he had rolled down the window to talk to somebody,'' he said. `` We've had agents killed around the country, but this one here is the first time we've had an agent killed here in over 10 years,'' <PERSON> Strang </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Official Says KGB Informants Not in Conflict with Glasnost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

 The use of Soviet citizens to spy on one another does not conflict with the principles of glasnost, according to a <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> official. `` The organs of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> have always regarded and still regard the organization of work with citizens' written and verbal information as one of the forms of their participation in ensuring state security,'' said A.P. <PERSON> Burakov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Mariyskaya </LOCATION>, 450 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He made his comments in Wednesday's editions of the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> in reply to a reader's query in another newspaper. The reader asked the other newspaper, Mariyskaya Pravda, how the use of <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> informants in virtually every work collective fitted into the era of glasnost _ President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness in Soviet society. `` In accordance with the constitution of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, every citizen is obliged to render the necessary assistance and cooperation in ensuring state security,'' <PERSON> Burakov </PERSON> said. `` An overwhelming majority of the people to whom we have to appeal for such help is willing to render it to us.'' In a rare and candid glimpse into the workings of the secret police force, <PERSON> Burakov </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> had a network of what he called `` free-lance employees.'' However, he said, their number was few and that their activities were confined to large enterprises that were carefully regulated. He did not elaborate on what the `` free-lance'' employees did, but said regular agents of the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> `` are acting openly and they are known by many people.''

<TEXT>
 A high-level advisory group once seen as the best hope for crafting a bipartisan solution to the nation's budget problems ended up deadlocked, issuing a final report today that splits essentially along party lines. The seven Republicans on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the one Democrat appointed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the president's pledge against raising taxes and praised his budget submission to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, calling it a `` workable plan for eliminating the deficit'' by 1993 However, the six Democrats on the panel who were appointed by the congressional leadership signed a minority report calling <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s budget `` neither theoretically sound nor politically realistic. The administration's $ 1.16 trillion spending plan for 1990 `` rules out any discussion of additional revenues and relies heavily on harsh and disproportionate reductions in domestic spending,'' the Democrats said. The sharply divergent reports ended up echoing the current debate between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional Democrats, where both sides remain far apart on solutions to a budget crisis which is expected to produce a deficit of $ 170 billion this year. Asked if the administration was disappointed that the panel had failed its mission to come up with a bipartisan formula for reducing the budget deficit, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` They did an excellent job in trying to carry out their mandate. It was a very difficult debate and discussion that they held.'' `` Some of the things in that report are very useful, and we'll have to analyze it for a more detailed respnse,'' he added `` They did the best they could,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., called the commission's report `` disappointing,'' but said it was not surprising `` With little support or leadership from the president or the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the commission was unable to face up to the difficult issues,'' he said in a written statement. `` It had no choice but to punt.'' The commission, which now goes out of existence, was a deep disappointment to supporters, who pushed legislation creating the panel through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash. Their hopes were that a panel of the nation's top business, labor and political leaders would be able to agree on a combination of spending cuts and tax increases to solve a deficit problem which has almost tripled the national debt over the past eight years. But while campaigning for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was openly critical of the commission, which had the backing of his Republican primary opponent, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed to reject any final report which called for a tax increase The commission's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> co-chairman, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, said he had `` hoped for a great deal more,'' but that the commission's fate was sealed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign against tax increases. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> co-chairman <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had hoped at one time to adopt an ambitious package that would cut $ 50 billion to $ 60 billion from the deficit, in part by raising taxes. But <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> drew criticism from within his own party last fall when he suggested cuts in government benefit programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, would be needed to balance the government's books. Not everyone was disappointed in the outcome of the panel's work. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, a Republican member of the commission who was an outspoken opponent of tax increases, said the majority report reflected the `` will of taxpayers throughout the nation.'' `` Testimony to the commission from 85 witnesses and more than 1,300 responses from private citizens and groups this past 11 months clearly indicated opposition to higher taxes and irresponsible spending,'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, another commission member, said he was pleased that both the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic reports criticized continued use of Social Security payroll taxes to mask the extent of the budget deficit. Both reports called for a goal of not simply eliminating the deficit but achieving surpluses to build up the funds necessary to cover the retirement of the `` Baby Boom'' generation. Both reports endorsed the need to reform the congressional budget process with the Republicans offering a detailed list of suggestions, many of them long championed by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and now <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. They include a constitutional balanced-budget amendment, presidential line-item veto authority in spending bills, a streamlined congressional process for making budget decisions and two-year rather than annual budgets. Commission member Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., a former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, blamed partisanship by Republicans for the group's failure to succeed `` The president did n't want a bipartisan deficit reduction plan. He wanted his own plan, the flexible freeze, and he insisted on it from <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Instead of something bold that could have moved us forward, we end up leaving it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration to continue the fight.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized the commission during the campaign, he did appoint the final two members in December, former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, R-Nev., and longtime friend <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Lud'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> After taking office, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided against extending the panel's March 1 reporting deadline for another six months, a step many on the panel had urged as a way of keeping the commission alive in the hopes that it eventually could reach a consensus That decision basically sealed the panel's fate and with only a few weeks remaining, the panel abandoned efforts for any compromise and began drafting majority and minority reports. In addition to <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, the other Democrats on the panel were <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> and <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohatyn </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banker In addition to <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, the other Republicans on the panel were Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration; and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration.

 <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON> slopped a jumbo can of cream of mushroom soup into a pot and stirred _ a sight you'd never see at her <LOCATION> Verdi </LOCATION> restaurant, where a meal can cost an easy $ 40 and strains of Puccini accompany the pasta. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser, biceps bulging from his T-shirt, looked on along with <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverton </PERSON>, a former pastry chef at star-studded <LOCATION> Spago </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s Plum in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Silverton </PERSON> resumed her demonstration of how to section an orange. `` They taste so much less bitter if you cut them away from the membranes,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Silverton </PERSON>, author of `` Desserts'' and about to open her own restaurant. `` Sage! Black pepper!'' said <PERSON> Tevis </PERSON> <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON>, the executive chef at Duc Duc Mousse Catering. `` We sure wo n't need any salt.'' The slightly surrealistic scene played out last week at the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, where some of the city's top chefs showed soup-kitchen cooks like <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> how to ladle out tastier and healthier fare to the 2,400 homeless people who crowd in daily for free meals. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and short-order cook who is halfway through an eight-month drug and alcohol recovery program, watched <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> slam a head of lettuce down, pop out the core, slice away brownish leaves and hold the remainder up for inspection. `` If you went to today's expensive restaurants, you'd only get the inside third of that _ just the heart,'' she said. No one's proposing serving haute cuisine on Skid Row, said Ms. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>, who runs a company that provides food to tony private schools and theaters and whose Women's Culinary Alliance organized the monthly teaching sessions. It's more a matter of souping up whatever is on hand _ like <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> tetrazzini for 900, which incorporated two cases of cream of mushroom soup, 100 pounds of pasta and a couple of cases of frozen peas. At the classes, held during regular meal preparation hours in the mission kitchen, the master chefs and the mission cooks face off across a table to prepare food together. It is then served to the transients who stream in off Main Street and hunker at the rough wooden tables. Most of the lessons are simple: Do n't over-saute, season food before popping it in the oven, do n't cook the taste and vitamins out, said Ms. <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON>, the caterer. At the first session last month, for example, chefs from the vogue City Restaurant and <PERSON> Angeli </PERSON> explained how to use up leftovers by making vegetable frittatas _ Italian-style omelettes. `` You can use up all your old produce _ just throw it in the egg mixture and bake it. Plus it's simple to do,'' Ms. <PERSON> Runyan </PERSON> said. `` The really important thing is that it is going to be nutritionally balanced,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>. `` Those people out there have a lot greater nutritional needs than you or me. ... The meal they get here may be their only one of the day.'' Members of the Women's Culinary Alliance, a `` networking'' food-industry group, at first merely gathered leftovers to donate to the mission, said Ms. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON>. `` But then I came down here one day and I saw the kitchen, and I realized that this was where we could really focus _ on education,'' she said. It looks as though the mission will get a whole new kitchen for free, along with the cooking tips. <PERSON> Shel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brucker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Avery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which designs and supplies restaurants, unveiled the plans, and said he was confident his suppliers would contribute materials so the restoration could be complete by year's end. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> cook, said he welcomed the chefs' advice. `` It's more than just thrown together now,'' he said. `` There's more of a menu, and the food is seasoned properly.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s courier to the Contras, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, testified today that <PERSON> North </PERSON> repeatedly told him he had authorization from his superiors for all his activities on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras. Under cross-examination, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> also said he met with at least half a dozen <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents in Central American countries to discuss supply efforts to the Contras at a time when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned military aid to the guerrillas. The agents were referred to in the courtroom by number. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> detailed the political sensitivity of handling the supply operation which involved shipping goods through <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> before they got into the Contras' hands. In connection with efforts to build a clandestine airstrip in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said that Costa Rican officials `` wanted to be helpful'' while trying `` to maintain a veneer of neutrality.'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> North </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> during questioning that <PERSON> North </PERSON> had said numerous times that in assisting the Contras he was carrying out the instructions of `` his superiors,'' including the president. After a brief recess, however, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was questioend closely by prosecutors about whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> specifically mentioned any of the superiors he was talking about. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> replied that <PERSON> North </PERSON> never said anything indicating that he was acting with the knowledge of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or that the president told him to lie or that the president told him to conceal what he was doing. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> North </PERSON> did not specifically mention the names of former National Security Advisers <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> or <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. `` He always used the word ` superior','' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> asked for dates but <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> was unable to provide them. Meanwhile, the government filed a memorandum in the latest dispute over classified information in the case. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has renewed a motion to declare that a federal law designed to protect state secrets from being spilled in the courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the North case. The process of handling classified material in court `` is not, as <PERSON> North </PERSON> contends, a reason to conclude that the trial is unworkable,'' said the filing by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keker </PERSON>, head of the prosecution team. North's lawyers said they first found out Monday night that memos from <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> to North which the government claimed were classified had already been made public. At a hearing Tuesday, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he will reconsider how he will handle classified material at <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s trial. `` For 2 -LCB- weeks, a jury has been ready to try this case and has n't been able to try it,'' said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> `` Now I hear we are dealing with classified documents that can be classified ex post facto,'' or after the fact. The memos written by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a onetime courier for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, were censored before the trial by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies, which claimed that release could endanger national security. However, the same memos had already been turned over to a private group in a separate legal case eight months before. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hylden </PERSON>, turned over copies of the memos last June to the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> as part of a lawsuit the activist group filed alleging a criminal conspiracy to supply the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. In the memos, <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> spelled out for his boss a wealth of detail about the private Contra supply network overseen by North. North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the attorney general about secret <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration efforts to aid the Contras when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had banned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the rebels. The trial was halted Monday when <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers wanted to use the name of a Costa Rican official, former security minister <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Piza </PERSON>, from one of <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s memos in cross-examining <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Piza </PERSON>'s name had been censored by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hylden </PERSON>, had informed independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office on Feb. 10 that the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> already had the memos. But <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers said they did n't find out about it until Monday night when they were notified by <PERSON> Hylden </PERSON>. Prosecutors working for <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said inaction by the office security director and inattention on their part, rather than any intent to hide information, was the reason <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers had n't been notified The defense alleged prosecutorial misconduct, but <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said he was `` not trying to look for sanctions'' against anyone. However, the judge said he was concerned about `` getting to the bottom of what's going on'' regarding the use of classified information at the trial. `` My concern is whether this presents an example of looseness in governmental dealings with this problem of classified information,'' he said. The judge questioned whether all his pretrial work on rules for handling such information would have to be done over. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> noted that he had a continuing motion from <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers asking whether a fair trial is possible under rules set by a law governing disclosure of state secrets at trial. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said `` the question of a mistrial is out of the question,'' a reference to the difficulty in getting a jury that was ignorant of <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s testimony at the televised Iran-Contra hearings in 1987. `` This case can never be tried again,'' he said.

 Vietnamese farmer <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Tan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang </PERSON> plans to return to his impoverished homeland Thursday because his dreams of a new life abroad quickly evaporated inside <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s cramped detention camps. <PERSON> Dien </PERSON>, his wife and three children have languished in the camps ever since they fled communist <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and sailed north to this British colony on the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> coast seven months ago. With dim prospects for resettlement and a gnawing concern for his parents back home, <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> has decided his family will join 68 other volunteers and fly to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in the first large-scale repatriation of boat people from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` I'm not clear if they -LRB- <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> officials -RRB- will punish us or not,'' <PERSON> Dien </PERSON>, 30, said at the spartan Argyle Street Holding Center. `` I'm not afraid.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials have promised to closely monitor <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>'s treatment of the returning boat people, and <PERSON> Fazlul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency overseeing the repatriation, said: `` Even at the <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> airport if they do not want to get down from the aircraft, they will not be dragged down.'' The fate of Dien is of more than passing interest to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which is straining under the weight of more than 25,000 boat people. If he is treated well, officials say, more Vietnamese may go back. If the repatriation is successful and `` word gets back ... we hope this will lead to further requests by people in camps in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' Secretary of Security <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said at a news conference. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> long has classified all boat people as refugees eligible for resettlement, and between 1979 and 1988 only 22 of more than 100,000 arrivals voluntarily returned home. But to stem the growing tide of Vietnamese arrivals, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> adopted a new policy under which most boat people arriving after June 15 are considered illegal immigrants subject to forcible repatriation. Only a small fraction that can prove they fled persecution are eligible for resettlement. More than 10,000 boat people have arrived since the change and some have registered their displeasure with the new policy by staging hunger strikes and refusing to be interviewed by <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> officials. A few have even asked for new boats to head for friendlier ports, although the government is unlikely to honor the request. Other new arrivals appear convinced their future lies back home, and about 300 names have been submitted to <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>, although some have since backed out. After the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> signed an agreement in December to set up a program of voluntary repatriation, a four-member <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> delegation came to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in February to issue travel documents for the first 81 boat people to go home. That number later dropped to 73 after some people backed out at the last minute. The group is to fly home on a jet chartered from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dragon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and be accompanied by at least one <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official. Each repatriated Vietnamese will receive a kit of basic supplies such as clothing and household utensils, said <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> commission in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has said quite clearly ... there would be no prosecution or any punitive or discriminatory measures,'' <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials will be allowed `` full access'' to monitor the repatriated boat people, he said. Despite the assurances, only a tiny minority of boat people have offered to go home, and it is unclear how many more may follow. In fact, the flow of boat people leaving <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> may again be on the rise. During the first 23 days of February, 328 Vietnamese sailed into the territory, compared with 114 for all of January and 91 in February 1988. `` It certainly points to the fact that -LRB- the new policy -RRB- in and of itself ... is obviously not a deterrent,'' said one Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. A key deterrent in the new policy is forcible repatriation of boat people classified as illegal immigrants, but <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> only accepts voluntary returnees. <PERSON> Akber </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government spokesman, said before repatriation of boat people classified as illegal immigrants can begin, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> must agree to accept them, offer assurances of safety and allow international monitoring of the program. An international meeting to discuss repatriation of boat people will be held in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, next month, and <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> is expected to attend. Meanwhile, resettlement of the approximately 15,000 Vietnamese in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> camps granted refugee status received a recent boost with several countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, agreeing to increase the number they accept. Officials believe 4,000 refugees may be resettled this year, up from 2,772 last year and 2,212 in 1987.

<HEAD>D.C. Tourism Grows Despite Crime Wave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 A trade group official says tourism in the nation's capital grew by a `` comfortable rate'' last year despite a drug-related crime wave in the city. `` Fortunately, we have n't found it affecting us,'' said <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tibor </PERSON>, director of tourism for the <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group that encourages tourists to visit the city. `` We've had a nice comfortable rate of growth.'' About 19.6 million visitors came to the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area last year, up 3 percent from the previous year, according to the association's annual report scheduled for release next month. `` We've done better than some of the previous doom-and-gloom forecasts,'' she said Tuesday. The district had a record 372 homicides last year, and police said 60 percent of them were related to drugs. A total of 91 people were slain in January and February of this year, compared with 54 in the same period last year.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Claim Capture of 250 Troops, Two Helicopters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Afghan guerrilla group said Wednesday that insurgents captured about 250 government troops, two helicopters and other Afghan communist weapons. The Afghan News Agency, an organ of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezb-i-Islami </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, said guerrillas also shot down a military transport plane and a MiG-27 jet fighter with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Stinger missile. There was no independent confirmation of the reports. The guerrillas said they captured 168 soldiers of the Afghan army's 20th Division in fighting Saturday along the strategic <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>. They said about 80 others were captured in other areas of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, but did not specify when or where. Guerrillas reportedly have blocked portions of the 240-mile <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, which is a key supply route from the Soviet border to the Afghan capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Two pilots defected with two Mi-35 helicopter gunships on Tuesday in central <LOCATION> Kapisa </LOCATION> province, northeast of the capital, the agency said. The agency said guerrillas also shot down two planes _ a transport plane near the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and a MiG fighter in the western province of <PERSON> Farah </PERSON>. A rival rebel group said Sunday that three communist regiments, or about 10,000 troops, have surrendered to the resistance in northern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since Soviet troops completed their military pullout on Feb. 15. The Soviets had intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979, one year after a communist coup prompted the Moslem guerrilla revolt. About 250,000 government security forces hold key Afghan cities but are encircled by the U.S.-backed guerrillas, who control most of the countryside. Guerrilla leaders predict that communist troops soon will defect in numbers large enough to cause the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government to fall. In another development, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> nurse with the humanitarian aid group Medecins <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> died in an avalanche southwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, an organization official said Wednesday. The Medecins <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON> spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said <PERSON> Kristof </PERSON> <PERSON> Cany </PERSON>, a male nurse, and an 18-year-old Afghan assistant died Sunday in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s central <PERSON> Wardak </PERSON> province. The two were walking between the <ORGANIZATION> Medecins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> clinic and living quarters when the snow roared down the mountain, the spokesman said. Four French nationals worked at the clinic, which has been treating war wounded for more than two years. Cany, 26, went to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in October and was scheduled to return to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> this month. He was from <LOCATION> Carmaux </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The French spokesman said <PERSON> Cany </PERSON>'s death is the first since <ORGANIZATION> Medecins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> began operating in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1981.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to run the nation's war on drugs, said today that despite pessimistic talk about his chances for success, he believes he can help `` bring some change for the better soon.'' At his confirmation hearing as director of national drug control policy, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>: `` I've been struck ... these last few weeks, as I've met with people inside government and out, by the pessimism, even fatalism, people have about our mission in the war on drugs. `` Some have told me they would n't wish this job on their worst enemy; others have made clear they think the war is already lost,'' he said. `` I think we must disagree. There are things that can be done.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he shared the concern of committee Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., about promising too much too soon `` But at the same time, I remain convinced that concerted, intelligent effort and strategy, if implemented, can bring change for the better _ and bring some change for the better soon,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who was education secretary during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> extended some bipartisan support to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, saying he would run `` political interference'' for him if necessary. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> at the opening of his confirmation hearing that `` as long as you make a good-faith effort to comply with this statute -LRB- creating the post -RRB-, you will have my personal and political support ...'' `` I personally will run all the political interference that you need,'' said <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, who worked for eight years to create the drug czar position. Although the overwhelming tenor of the opening statements by committee members was supportive of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., said he was `` somewhat troubled'' by the nomination and might not vote for him `` If we were to elect a national gadfly in this area, you would have my vote,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. The senator said that when <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was education secretary and complained about the drug problem, he told other <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretaries _ the secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> and defense and the attorney general, among others _ what they should be doing to fight the drug battle. `` In your own department, where you had a chance to do something, you asked for a cut in one-half of the money for the drug problem,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` If I vote no, and I think I may be the only one, I hope you do a job that will make my vote wrong,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was introduced and endorsed by four senators and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member: Sens. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>; and Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> reiterated today his criticism of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not giving <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> Cabinet status. `` At one time or another, you will have to go to the mat with everyone of your <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> colleagues and you need to meet them on equal terms in the decisive forum, the Cabinet Room,'' he said. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> described the job before <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as `` a Herculean task,'' and said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was `` bound to fail'' in some of his efforts. However, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said he would only criticize <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> if he failed to come up with a strategy to deal with the drug problem and did not take full advantage of the powers his position holds. He said the position `` may be our last best chance to take hold of an epidemic wave'' of drug abuse. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, praised <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> and said his initial doubts about the wisdom of appointing one person to coordinate all federal anti-drug activities had been relieved. In advance of the hearing, <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said in a television interview today that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s pugnacious reputation as education secretary in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will serve him well in his new job. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is `` going to have to be combative, he's going to have to be tough, he's going to have to be a real scrapper,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` The very things that made <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> controversial as secretary of education are things that may make him particularly useful as the so-called drug czar,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. `` He was never afraid of controversy, he was never afraid of being critical. `` This first drug director is going to have to be willing to take on other Cabinet members ... and going to have to be willing to be controversial,'' the committee chairman said. According to the bill passed last year creating the post, the director must compile in his first 180 days a comprehensive drug control strategy encompassing all aspects of the battle against illegal drugs, from law enforcement here and abroad to treatment programs for addicts. It may be that he's already leaped the toughest personal hurdle, as he quit his two-pack-a-day cigarette smoking habit, <ORGANIZATION> Tell </ORGANIZATION> said. Although <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said he does n't care about the smoking, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> made a commitment Jan. 12, the day President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominated him to become drug director, to stop smoking by the time he took office. He kicked the habit by attending a stop-smoking clinic, called `` Breathe Free,'' when he, his wife <PERSON> Elayne </PERSON> and son <PERSON> John </PERSON> went to the Coolfont resort in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, last week, <ORGANIZATION> Tell </ORGANIZATION> said `` I went in his office and there's no ashtray,'' said Tell, but there are some crutches _ a bowl of fruit and lollipops.

 Federal authorities said they will seize the home of a 77-year-old blind man convicted last year of selling crack cocaine from the house. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> was given two days Tuesday by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

It was seized as a result of <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>'s 1988 arrest and conviction on the sale of crack <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> said he was blinded by a shooting in 1961 in front of the house. The small wooden house and the half-acre of property are worth about $ 20,000, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. The property was seized under the federal Controlled Substances Act because police determined it had continually been used as a storage place for crack cocaine, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Beane </PERSON>. He can appeal the seizure by filing a claim of intent to hold onto the property within 10 days.

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary victory over Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> carried him to the door of the City Hall office his father held for 21 years, but a new foe and an old nemesis want to bar his entry. By defeating <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> Tuesday, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> advanced to the April 4 general election and a contest Democrats have won without fail since 1931 _ including six straight terms captured by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, the late, legendary boss of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> politics. The 46-year-old white nominee faces third-party candidate <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, previously <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s chief black rival and now <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s choice. He also faces the Republican primary winner, a title claimed by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, who bucked <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders by launching a write-in candidacy a week ago. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney, rarely invoked his father's name during the primary, but he did in his victory statements and in TV interviews this morning `` I think my father's looking down upon me, on a beautiful, warm day in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ... very proud of me, and most importantly, proud of the type of campaign that I ran in the last three months _ reaching out to every community,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said. He dismissed suggestions that racial factors could split the vote as it did in 1983, when he lost the nomination to the late <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, the city's first black mayor. `` I'm not going to be vying for any one vote,'' he said. `` I'm going to be vying for votes of everybody throughout this city This is a city made up of the black community, the white community, the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> community, the Hispanic community, and they're all stressing issues. ... This will be a good clean election.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> recalled advice he received from his father, who died in 1976, three months into his third decade in office. `` You're going to have ups and downs, you're going to win, you're going to lose,'' he recalled his father saying `` Remember, -LRB- choosing politics -RRB- is your decision.'' With 2,843 of 2,911 precincts reporting, or 98 percent, unofficial totals showed <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> with 481,370 votes, or 56 percent, to 367,919 votes, or 43 percent, for the black acting mayor. Three other candidates shared the remaining votes. `` This is not the end of <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>,'' said the 54-year-old <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> in conceding. `` I will continue to work ... to heal, to build and to bring people together in this city.'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> began the day today campaigning at an elevated train stop. Pledging to crush the `` <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> machine,'' he asked the crowd repeatedly `` Can we win?'' as supporters responded, `` Yes.'' <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> had no formal appearances scheduled early today. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> rode overwhelming white support to win, capping a three-month campaign that was largely free of racial strife and, by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> standards, rancor. But <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, a former Democratic alderman and county party chairman, could cut into that base if his write-in challenge is successful. <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> won more than 80 percent of the white vote in his unsuccessful 1987 third-party challenge against <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. With 96 percent of 2,911 precincts reporting, unofficial results gave <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> 10,711 votes, or 45 percent, to 10,234 votes, or 43 percent, to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> endorsed candidate Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>. Two others each had 5 percent. `` You made history,'' <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> told cheering supporters. `` You did something in seven days that no one has seen before. You showed that you can write someone in for mayor of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> refused to concede and <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> said the race was too close to call. Because of the difficulty of counting write-in votes, the outcome of the Republican race might not be known before Thursday. If <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> faces <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> next month, the battle would be reminiscent of the one <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> waged to become the city's first black mayor. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> narrowly won the 1983 Democratic primary when the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and incumbent <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> split the white vote. He then rode monolithic black support to squeak past Republican <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Epton </PERSON> in a racially charged campaign. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gained additional support from liberal whites and Hispanics to repeat in 1987, becoming the first mayor since the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to win re-election. And also like the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> died in office without having annointed a successor, touching off a war between <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> that caused a deep rift in the black community. Their struggle intensified after <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> was elected in December 1987 to succeed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by a City Council coalition of mostly white aldermen. When the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last November ordered a special mayoral election to complete the final two years of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s term, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said he would run a third-party bid to give <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> `` a clear shot'' at <LOCATION> Daley </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> supporters said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> sabotaged the mayor's chances by helping hold down black voter turnout and refusing <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s pleas for black unity against <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>. `` The negative campaign launched by <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> ... lasted for a long time _ and that caused some confusion in the black community. It was n't until really mid-January ... before we could bring it all together and of course that had an impact,'' said <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Reynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>. In order to gain the mayoralty, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> again will have to overcome formidable opposition from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who engineered <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s surge among black voters in the waning days of the primary. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he felt no obligation to endorse <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> because he did not receive <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s backing when he ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination last year. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said the challenge would be to re-assemble the coalition that elected <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Somebody has to rise above the eye-for-an-eye and break that cycle of pain. ... The bitterness at this point is substantial,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` We believe that those who fought the <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> machine tonight ought to be congratulated. They tried their best. We invite them now to join with us,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>.

 A state appeals court today overturned the murder conviction of <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in the 1976 slaying of a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police officer, a case resurrected by the film `` The Thin Blue Line.'' In a unanimous decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> said prosecutors suppressed evidence during <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' 1977 trial and used perjured testimony. `` When deceit produces court rulings that have the effect of denying one a fair trial, then the conviction should be vacated,'' wrote Judge M.P. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. The appeals court ordered <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> transferred from prison to the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinne </PERSON> said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> will be held there while prosecutors decide whether to retry him. `` We have one of the prosecutors reviewing evidence and interviewing witnesses in the case. We're in process of determining whether we have sufficient evidence for a retrial,'' the district attorney said. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, 40, had maintained that he was innocent. He received the death penalty in 1977 for the slaying of Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, but that sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1980. He has served 12 years behind bars. His case received wide public attention with `` The Thin Blue Line,'' a documentary on the case in which the prosecution's chief witness recanted. Defense attorney <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON> said he will seek <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' release on bail, and he predicted prosecutors would insist on a new trial. `` Not because they have any evidence,'' he said, `` but because of the politics.'' The appeals court reviewed the case on the recommendation of state District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON>, who said after a hearing in December that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> did not receive a fair trial. The appeals court said <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' rights were violated when the state knowingly suppressed evidence that a witness, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, had failed to identify <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in a lineup; that a police officer advised her she did n't identify <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, and that the officer told her the person she should have identified. The court also said Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> committed perjury by testifying, outside the presence of the jury, that she had identified <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> in the lineup. In his opinion, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> wrote: `` In the present case, the trial court found the state was guilty of suppressing evidence favorable to the accused, deceiving the trial court during applicant's trial, and knowingly using perjured testimony. In each instance, the nature of the evidence or testimony was such that beneficial results inured to the state at the expense of due process.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Mildred </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was overjoyed at the news. `` We had planned on going down to <ORGANIZATION> TDC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- over Easter break to see him,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now I just do n't have the words to express myself. We're just as happy as can be up here.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' case was resurrected with the help of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> filmmaker <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' documentary `` The Thin Blue Line,'' which strongly suggested the slaying was committed by the prosecution's chief witness, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>. `` I'm delighted,'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` I very much hope to be in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> when he is released.'' On Nov. 28, 1976, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, then 27, ran out of gas while driving home from work. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a Vidor 16-year-old who had stolen a car and driven to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, helped <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> get gas and spent the part of the day with him. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was shot and killed that night by a motorist he had pulled over on a traffic violation. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> had testified that <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> killed Wood. But <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> recanted in the movie and during a hearing in December. He is on Death Row for another slaying. The <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pardons </ORGANIZATION> and Parole on Friday had denied parole for <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> after a special review. The board cited the violent nature of the crime and use of a weapon.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' 824 stores across the nation began reopening today after a 42-hour facelift to complete price reductions on 1.5 billion pieces of merchandise. `` People are backed up as far as we can see. It's wall-to-wall people,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> store at the <LOCATION> Northland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` We have Christmas-quantity people, and we have better than Christmas traffic,'' said <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, who estimated more than 1,000 people waited outside for the doors to open. Workers changed prices Tuesday on everything _ including light bulbs, toasters and polished door knobs _ as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> prepared for a new retailing strategy it hopes will win customers. Employees also had to change signs and displays, take inventory and clean up before the openings, which occurred at noon local time. `` The worst was the screwdrivers,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, a high school freshman who spent much of the day at the <ORGANIZATION> Northland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> store repricing baby booties and toddlers' dresses. `` You had to take them all down, clean each one by hand, then put them all back.'' all Otherwise, it will use the strategy that retailers call `` everyday low pricing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, in adopting the strategy, joins a growing list, that includes <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Target discount chain and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and Co.. At the Columbus store, 700 workers scrambled to the tune of `` Do n't Worry, Be Happy,'' as they marked down items such as twin canopy beds from $ 269.99 to $ 99.00, a Diehard automobile battery from $ 72 to $ 64, and a Craftsman power drill from $ 59.99 to $ 32.62 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its own brands and the 1,000 other brand names it carries. `` I do n't think they had any choice. They lost their customer base,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacks </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think Wednesday will be a madhouse at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. But will they be able to re-educate their customers not to come in just for a sale?'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the strategy paid off in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, where sales rose 15 percent when <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> tested the idea last fall. `` And <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will invest in an advertising campaign that, to not hear about it, you would practically have to be comatose,'' <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. The cash register rings about 3,000 times a day in the 100,000-square-foot <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> store, but the only sound in the last couple of days was the clicking of pricing guns and muffled sounds of store officials keeping in touch with walkie-talkies. About 100 high school students worked for $ 5 an hour to help company officials in shirt-sleeves and scores of others with the makeover. `` It's the most exciting thing I've ever been involved in in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, manager of the Northland Mall store and a 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> employee. `` It's no longer that old sea of yellow,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' old yellow-with-black-lettering sale signs. The new signs, touting new, lower prices, are in vibrant red and blue. In apparel, the signs are magenta and gray. `` They really needed to do something dramatic like that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sacks </PERSON> said. `` We'll just have to wait a year or two to see if it works.''

<HEAD>Ethics Panel Refers Moonlighting Questions To Others</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Top 7 grafs new with decisions on outside income. Picks up 3rd
graf pvs, The panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ethics commission agreed today there should be a uniform limit on the outside income earned by top government officials but called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to set the limit and let the President exempt some activities, such as scholarly writing. The eight-member panel completed its fifth and final working day still sharply divided over moonlighting by judges, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, top executive branch officials and the most senior aides in all three branches. Their compromise recommendation was that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> limit outside earned income to a fixed percentage of an official's federal salary. A majority of the group favored a figure closer to the 15 percent which nows governs the executive branch rather than the higher amounts allowed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the judiciary. And they asked that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allow to the president to exempt from the limit income from categories of work that do not raise ethical issues or interfere with the full performance of official duties. They tried but failed to agree on a list of exemptions. Former White House counsel <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> suggested listing teaching by judges, among others. But former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who wanted to exempt royalties, objected to exempting teaching. `` When you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching, you're not a fulltime government worker,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said `` You're not in your office when you're teaching and you need to be there so other judges can talk to you.'' With that compromise, the panel completed work on the recommendations due to go to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by March 9. The issue of moonlighting income was the most divisive it encountered in a review of all federal ethics laws and rules. This issue had consumed more than an hour of debate on Tuesday. The panel was wrestling with questions such as how much money a federal judge should be allowed to make teaching at a law school, and whether federal officials should be allowed to make more money writing novels or songs than from the government. These questions about the proper limits of income earned outside government work have divided the commission more sharply than any others it has confronted in four day-long meetings. The panel could not decide Tuesday whether to recommend a ceiling on all outside earned income or whether certain activities should be exempt from any ceiling because they pose no conflict of interest. At one point, former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> argued, `` Suppose you write a popular song one night; that does n't belong to the government.'' To which former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> replied, `` We do n't want a government of songwriters. Last week, the panel tentatively approved applying the executive branch's outside-income limit _ 15 percent of the government salary, with no exemptions _ to top officials of all three branches. There is no limit now for judges; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits members to 30 percent of salary and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to 40 percent. <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> argued, `` If the next <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON> is deep in the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, all he can get out of it is 15 percent of a GS-14 salary or he'd have to quit.'' <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bello </PERSON>, general counsel to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> special trade representative, replied that the ceiling would only apply to top officials, at GS-17 and above. <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, however, found other examples: `` Suppose you work for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the MX missile and you develop an idea for hybrid corn one night that's worth $ 1 million _ you've got to give it away.'' `` I will dissent from a cap unless there are some totally excepted categories of earned income, such as writing a popular song,'' he said. <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said he had been called by a federal judge whose teaching and legal writings bring him income greater than 15 percent of his federal salary. He said the judge said he would quit the bench if the cap were enacted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` A judge teaching at an accredited law school is a fine activity and there is not the shadow of the possibility of a conflict,'' <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who is a former appellate judge, responded, `` If you want to be a judge, you ought to be a full-time judge.'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> also said exemptions would send the message that `` we do n't think it's unethical not to give your full-time effort to your government job. <PERSON> Bello </PERSON> also backed the ceiling. `` I would n't want to drive a good judge off the bench, but ... I oppose watering down the current law.'' `` These activities do take time from your work,'' she added. `` And public confidence can be undermined if public servants are taking time from work.'' The panel's chairman, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON>, a former appellate judge, advocated the exemptions, particularly for judges to teach law. `` This interplay between a live judge and a law school is very vital to our society.'' If there are no exemptions, <PERSON> Wilkey </PERSON> said, `` We'll lose the brightest minds _ people who've got the extra energy to do more work. They're the big contributors to our society and we'll lose them from government.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Fielding </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said the panel seemed to be ignoring other kinds of outside earned income, such as breeding race horses or rose-growing. Seeing no reason to discriminate in favor of some outside activities over others, Fielding said he leaned toward a cap.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration missed two more congressional deadlines Wednesday for staking out positions on major defense issues, saying it was n't ready to produce reports dealing with Star Wars and the B-2 stealth bomber. Col. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Monteverde </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said acting <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON> was notifying <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that the March 1 deadline for the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> report would be missed because the future of the anti-missile defense system is being addressed in a much broader <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> strategic policy review. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, in a brief statement, said the report on the B-2 would not go forward Wednesday because it was `` still in coordination.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> official who asked not to be named said, however, that that report also was being delayed until the national security review was completed. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his budget address to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, announced last month he had ordered the broad policy review and said he expected it to be completed within 90 days. On Feb. 15, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> cited the same review as the reason it would not meet a deadline for choosing between two mobile nuclear missiles _ the single-warhead Midgetman or a rail-car version of the 10-warhead MX. The missed deadlines come at the same time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been unable to win <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation of his choice as defense secretary, former Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and other administration officials have insisted that Tower's troubles are not responsible for the failure to meet the congressional deadlines. Rather, they assert that those deadlines were set much too early for a new administration and that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to take the time to review the nation's entire strategic posture. Other officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, however, say little in the way of policy formation is being accomplished at the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> because of the lack of leadership. Those officials, holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, spoke on the condition of anonymity. The first report that had been due Wednesday dealt with one deployment option for a Star Wars system _ the so-called ALPS or Accidental Launch Protection System. First suggested by Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, ALPS would entail the construction of a small missile-defense system capable of stopping a missile fired by accident or by a terrorist group The second report due Wednesday involved the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s B-2, a new bomber that is supposed to be almost invisible to radar. The first of the bombers was unveiled in November but has not yet flown. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> wants to build 132 of the planes, but estimated in December that, counting research and development costs, the bombers would cost more than $ 500 million each. Even if research and development expenses are discounted, each plane will cost $ 305 million to build. Faced with that kind of expense, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said it wanted a report by March 1 `` setting forth the total program cost, in constant and in current dollars, of the <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> B-2 Bomber program.''

<TEXT>
 The city's third-party <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> is gearing up for an election in which it hopes to prove that it can outlast its charismatic leader, Mayor <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, often billed as the nation's only socialist mayor, announced last fall that he would not seek a fifth term in city elections March 7. He said he wants other Progressives to move up the electoral ladder, in part to dispel the notion that the movement is a `` one-man band.'' He plans to teach and write. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, 47, was elected by 10 votes in 1981 over a 10-year Mayor <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Paquette </PERSON> and a Democratic machine widely seen as having atrophied. He promptly put his long-time leftist activism to work building a political power base of his own in the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. He was re-elected three times by more comfortable margins, winning in 1987 with 6,901 votes to 5,594 votes. And even his critics, with a mixture of bemusement and grudging admiration, give him credit for reinvigorating city politics. `` He brought a breath of fresh air to City Hall,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, owner of an office supply company and long-time Democratic regular. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> News and World Report, not a publication known for radical politics, picked <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> in 1987 as one of the nation's 20 best mayors. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, a city of 38,000 and the closest thing <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> has to a metropolitan area, has prospered and been ranked high in national quality-of-life surveys. Love him or hate him, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> will be a tough act to follow.'' A month ago, it looked as though <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>'s Progressive era might end with <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' departure. The coalition picked as his would-be successor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, a city administrator with no experience running for office and without the rhetorical flair and propensity for bashing American corporate capitalism that has given <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> a national reputation. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, 39, faces tough opposition from Democrat <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON>, 46, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aldermen </ORGANIZATION> and owner of a downtown clothing and souvenir store. She has not only the Democratic nomination, but support from Republicans. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> did n't even field a candidate. Attacking <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> from the left is 48-year-old lawyer <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, whose fledgling <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> advocates a moratorium on `` development for profit.'' She denounces <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, saying they've `` sold out'' to business interests. Initially, many political observers thought <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> was in trouble, facing a single candidate backed by Democrats and Republicans and likely to lose some of the hard-core left to <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>. He also was criticized as bland, a mumbler unable to articulate strong beliefs. But <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> appears to have turned things around, picking up several key labor endorsements, solidifying support among peace activists and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Democrats. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON>, who helped develop several programs for women as chief of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, even picked up an endorsement over his two female opponents from the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for Women. That was seen as a coup in a university town with a strong feminist community. `` They're going to win, it's that simple,'' <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> political scientist <PERSON> Garrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> and the Progressives. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s view was supported by a poll published Sunday in The <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, which showed <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> with 40 percent of likely voters supporting him, 31 percent for <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON>, 6 percent for <PERSON> Baird </PERSON>, and 2 percent for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackett </PERSON>, an independent candidate running on what he calls the `` tax revolt'' ticket. The telephone poll of 342 likely voters found 21 percent undecided or refusing to answer. It had a margin of error of 6.5 percent. Those two factors appeared to leave open the possibility that <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON> still could win the race. <PERSON> Chioffi </PERSON> has emphasized her experience as a small business owner and her belief that men and women and rich and poor are equal by virtue of opportunity. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> -RRB- talks about helping the little guy, about helping single mothers and poverty-stricken women,'' she told the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't see anybody as being a little guy. Working people are not little.'' But that pitch of equality of opportunity has not resonated much in a city schooled on eight years of <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' speeches about class struggle. <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> says he will maintain the ideals of the city's Progressives He angered some of them when in his first batch of campaign literature, he described himself as an `` independent'' rather than as a Progressive. And he does not embrace the socialist label as <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> does. But he says he wants to look out for the elderly, the poor and `` the little guy.'' `` I'm no <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Clavelle </PERSON> said. `` Our backgrounds are different, our styles are different, but our political visions are the same.''

 A man who police say once threw money to children in poor neighborhoods and later was charged with trying to sell cocaine changed his plea to guilty after seeing a jury of `` 14 mothers with kids,'' his lawyer says. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> `` knows he made a mistake and he's ready to pay the price,'' attorney <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 27, pleaded guilty Tuesday after an all-woman jury had been selected. `` We picked a jury and saw 14 mothers with kids and saw they were against drugs,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. Police said they found two pounds of cocaine, three guns and $ 57,800 when they searched a car <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was using. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> had been accused of sending children in one of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>'s poorest neighborhoods into frenzies by flinging bills as large as $ 50s from the sunroof of his car The act was captured on home video by a neighborhood activist who shoed it to police. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> denied the tapes pictured his client, but said the suspicion it created brought <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to the attention of the police. `` That's why the cops went after him,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said

 A Northwest Orient DC-10 en route from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> diverted to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> today after one engine stalled, the airline said. Flight 47 touched down at <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> at 2:34 p.m. `` after a routine two-engine landing'' and the 222 passengers and 10 crew disembarked normally, an airline statement said. Airline spokesman <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Plews </PERSON> said the No. 2 engine stalled on takeoff from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> `` and instead of trying to restart the engine in flight, the captain decided to divert to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION>.'' Mechanics checked out the engine on the tarmac, running it up to full power in a test, `` and discovered that there was no problem with it,'' he said. With its `` clean bill of health,'' <PERSON> Plews </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orient </ORGANIZATION> was assembling a new crew and planned to take off for <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> later tonight. Meanwhile, he said, passengers were taken to an airport hotel for dinner. Asked what might have caused the engine not to start, <PERSON> Plews </PERSON> said, `` We do n't know, but it is possible for engines to do this occasionally. It could be a lack of air flow through the engine which can be caused by an atmospheric condition.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 99-0 today to confirm <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> as energy secretary, handing the retired admiral the `` daunting challenge'' of refurbishing the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s crippled network of nuclear weapons factories The vote came less than four hours after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted 19-0 to recommend that <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, 61, be made the first career military man to head the department since it was created in 1977. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D.-La., chairman of the committee, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that the job of reviving and cleaning up the nuclear weapons complex was a top priority `` It is perhaps the most daunting challenge that we have ever given to anybody in the Cabinet ... anytime in the history of this country,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> called <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> `` a man of that substance and that reputation,'' echoing the warm praise <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> won during his confirmation hearing last Wednesday. Although he has no experience in the conventional energy field, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> developed an expertise in nuclear power during a 41-year <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> career that included training in reactor technology as well as the command of a nuclear submarine. Now he's about to enter battle against one of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's biggest challenges: revitalizing the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear weapons complex and planning a long-range cleanup operation that may cost $ 100 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spends about two-thirds of its budget, which this year is $ 14 billion, on developing, building and testing nuclear weapons for the Pentagon. The remaining one-third is spent on conventional energy projects, mainly research. Key parts of the 12-state weapons complex are shut down because of safety, technical and managerial concerns, leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> without the capacity to build nuclear weapons for the first time since the dawn of the nuclear age. `` It's the most daunting management task I think we've ever given to anybody I've seen in government,'' Sen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, D-La., said during <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' Feb. 22 hearing Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, said that although the weapons plant problems were created by past administrations, `` You, Admiral <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, will be the man in the limelight or hotseat charged with getting the situation effectively under control as quickly as possible.'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told his confirmation hearing the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s weapons complex was `` antique, out-of-date, desperately in need of change. He also ripped the department's management structure, calling it `` a mess'' and vowing to install the core of a new management team to oversee the plants within six months. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is a 1949 graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and was hand-picked by the late admiral <PERSON> Hyman </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickover </PERSON>, father of the modern nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. He served as a submarine commander, cruiser and destroyer force commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Seventh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Sixth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> before capping his career as chief of naval operations, the service's top position. He retired in 1986. The four-star admiral is not shy about stressing his relationship with <PERSON> Rickover </PERSON>. `` I learned from him that the fulfillment of the mission of our national defense and the protection of the environment were mutually compatible objectives,'' <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> told his confirmation hearing. He said one of his top priorities as energy secretary would be to cultivate in department managers a commitment to safe operations of the nuclear complex. `` All that fancy technology is useless, and perhaps even a threat to society, unless we properly educate and train those entrusted with its operation,'' he said.

 Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> signed a new agreement to buy the $ 5.4 billion <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant for $ 1 and dismantle it, and a key lawmaker today said he likes the deal. Under the agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> will let the state tear down the never-used plant, which has had to wage licensing battles since its completion in 1985 and nearly bankrupted the utility with cost overruns and delays. `` It is time to end this matter once and for all and turn our energies to new, productive measures for <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the state,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said Tuesday. Unlike a similar agreement last year, which was killed by state legislators, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> predicted this deal would succeed because it largely bypasses the Legislature. State <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Republican whose support for the plan is crucial to its success, said today that he likes the deal. <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> is on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 55 miles from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` I think we should get the issue behind us, at least have some kind of direction and this gives us stability,'' <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said. Other reaction was mixed. <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> business leaders contend the $ 2.5 billion loss that <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> plans to take on the plant during the next three years will be passed to its customers, who already pay among the nation's highest electric bills. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulka </PERSON>, of the Association for a <LOCATION> Better </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said his business group was `` very, very skeptical'' because `` <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> continues to rise from the dead.'' But <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Executive <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, whose county is where the plant is located, said: `` I am pleased that <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s longest-running soap opera has finally gotten its cancellation notice. In December, the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> refused to act on a deal negotiated in June by <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> with the utility that would also have had the state buy the plant for $ 1 and dismantle it. In that deal, <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> would have been guaranteed 5 percent rate increases for at least three years, and possibly for a decade. At the time, key lawmakers said the deal was too expensive for <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> customers. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said the legislators were simply afraid to face a politically tough situation. Under Tuesday's agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> is guaranteed no particular rates, which are decided by the state <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> predicted the rates would be lower than proposed in the earlier deal, probably less than 4.5 percent. `` Nobody is going to be responsible for the rates,'' quipped <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>. `` It's wonderful.'' Last week, however, the commission approved a temporary 5.4 percent rate increase for the utility. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said he made the new deal because he believed the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was about to grant <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> a license to operate the plant at 25 percent of full power. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> last week announced a proposed rule change aimed at revitalizing the nation's nuclear power industry by cutting down the licensing process for plants to six years or less, compared with the recent average of 13 years. Many utilities, swamped by debt from nuclear plant construction, contend that long delays in obtaining an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> license are a main reason why no new plants have been ordered since the mid-1970s. The 800-megawatt <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant, which was proposed in 1966, has thus far been unable to win anything more than a 5 percent testing license from federal officials. That's largely due to the refusal of <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> officials to cooperate in emergency planning for the plant. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the officials long have argued that <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> should never be allowed to open because the area around the plant could n't be safely evacuated during a nuclear emergency <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> disputed that. Tuesday's agreement is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors and shareholders, a process that utility spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> said would `` take approximately three months.'' `` While the approvals for this agreement are being obtained, the company will continue to vigorously pursue a full power operating license for <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> before the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION> statement. However, it said it would operate the plant only if shareholders veto the agreement, which also requires approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Harenberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> called the new agreement `` very unfortunate'' and said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> is `` forcing the public to pay for the foolishness and imprudence of the investors of <ORGANIZATION> Lilco </ORGANIZATION>.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today voted 98-1 in favor of the nomination of Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> secretary, saying he will be `` a caring advocate'' for millions of poor Americans. The sole dissenting vote was cast by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, who said he was disturbed that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has declined to take a final position on several abortion-related issues, including whether the federal government should back medical research using tissue from aborted fetuses. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, praised the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> doctor's commitment to providing health care for the needy and said his policies at <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> will define President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a `` kinder, gentler <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> will be the only black in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet. `` I am confident Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is going to be a caring advocate for these millions of Americans,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said as Republicans and Democrats alike praised the nomination. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said that `` as a matter of conscience'' he could not vote for <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> based on `` his failure or refusal to take a position on a number of extremely important issues,'' all of which were related to abortion. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said that because he supports the views of the anti-abortion community, which opposes research using aborted fetal tissue, `` I can not turn my back on that opinion.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> won 19-0 approval in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week and no opposition surfaced Monday at a courtesy hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which did not vote separately on the nomination. As the 55-year-old blood specialist and medical school founder moved toward confirmation, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 99-0 to approve retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, as energy secretary. The action came a few hours after the Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> endorsed <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' nomination, 19-0. Meanwhile, in other action on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> involving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointees: _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the former education secretary who has been named to the new post of chief drug enforcement executive, was appearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., struggled eight years to create the position _ <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> congressman and undersecretary of state, was appearing for the second straight time before the Veterans Affairs Committee on his nomination to head the new Veterans Affairs Department Most senators on the two committees before which <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> testified were highly complimentary of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and will step down as its president to take the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> job. Few displayed much interest in <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s views on abortion, an issue that has caused controversy for the nominee since his remarks in the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitution </ORGANIZATION> that he favored abortion rights and to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., that he supported the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that legalized abortion Abortion opponents pounced on the statements and demanded assurances from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration that <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s HHS policies would conform to the views of the president when it came to abortion. At his confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> apologized to <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the panel, for having `` misspoken'' his position on abortion. At each hearing he repeated that he shares President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s views on the issue: He opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life. He also said that, like <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he opposes federal funding for abortions except when the mother's life is threatened and would welcome a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision overturning its 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, however, declined to take a final position on whether the federal government should back medical research using tissue from aborted fetuses. He said he would not do `` anything to encourage abortion in order to get fetal tissue,'' but he said he wanted to review an advisory committee's recommendations before stating a further position on the issue. Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., an abortion foe, accused him of `` ducking'' the question and voted `` present'' on his nomination in committee <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a personal friend of the Bushes, is set to take the reins of the largest department in the federal bureaucracy, controlling a budget of nearly $ 400 billion and managing 114,000 employees. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION>, which administers a third of all federal spending, includes Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was to be sworn in immediately after his confirmation, although a formal ceremony is scheduled for March 10.

 Nellis Air Force Base officials are rethinking a policy on dealing with juveniles after an 8-year-old boy was arrested for hitting a security guard in the face with a pencil. Authorities say the boy was arrested by base security police, charged with battery, read his rights and turned over to local authorities. He was later released to his parents and the charges were dropped. The arrest occurred after the boy tossed the pencil out the window of a school bus, striking a sentry guarding the entrance to the base on the northern edge of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. The sentry was not hurt. Security guards boarded the bus and took the boy into custody after he admitted tossing the pencil. Nellis officials said the boy was arrested under a new policy designed to crack down on juvenile vandalism. They admit the boy's actions may not have fallen under the vandalism category and say the policy may be revised but not dropped `` We could have handled it with more sensitivity,'' Maj. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrijauskas </PERSON>, base spokesman, said Tuesday. `` Because of this situation, the policy is being reviewed.'' The boy's father, Sgt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, who works on the base, declined to allow the family to discuss the matter publicly.

 Radar has pinpointed an object believed to be the cargo door that tore from a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet, but federal investigators say they are n't sure whether it can be retrieved from under 16,800 feet of water. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said late Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> radar tracked a large object 85 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> about 45 seconds after the pilot of Flight 811 reported an in-flight emergency. Nine passengers were swept to their deaths when a 10-by-20 foot section of the fuselage, including the cargo door, tore from the right side of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at 22,000 feet on Friday. Twenty-seven others were treated for injuries. `` The radar picked up something that could be a large piece of metal, possibly the cargo door,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said Tuesday night. `` That information is going back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to see if we can indeed determine ... that was the cargo door, and its exact location.'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the door would be `` very helpful to us in our analysis,'' but added that he did not know whether the object could be salvaged and the decision to try would be up to the full five-member <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> board. `` We have the location at the surface of the water,'' he said. `` You're talking about three miles -LRB- down -RRB-, one can only guess where that is.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolcott </PERSON>, a technician and research submarine pilot at the <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> Undersea Research Lab at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawaii </ORGANIZATION>, today said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is about the only agency with equipment capable of recovering the door. Such a search would probably involve use of an underwater sonar sled and a remote-controlled vehicle equipped with a camera, he said. The vehicle could probably hook a line to the door so it could be lifted to the surface, he said. The least likely possibility because of the tremendous expense _ up to $ 40,000 a day _ would be the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Sea Cliff, one of the world's few manned research submarines capable of reaching that depth, <PERSON> Wolcott </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s field work was nearly completed and investigators would leave <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> today and tomorrow. Earlier Tuesday, investigators reported that the same front right cargo door had had a recent history of problems, including a seal that was repaired in January. Investigators had not yet determined whether the recent repairs were connected to the accident, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Drucella </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` We just do n't know that right now,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said the faulty door seal had to be fixed before the plane could fly again, and other electrical problems did not affect the plane's airworthiness. On Dec. 5, the door's electrical door-closing mechanism worked intermittently, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. It was repaired, but failed again on Dec. 13 and Dec. 22, he said. It was fixed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Dec. 23 and no further trouble was reported, he said. `` I might add, though, that it is completely proper to close this door manually, and that's what was done,'' he said. <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said he did not know the details of the work on the door's seal, but `` I do n't think it was major.'' Meanwhile Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials said a safety pin had to be replaced in a rear cargo door of a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 that was to fly from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The repair delayed the arrival in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> by 18 hours. Many passengers, however, said they did not mind the delay, including <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hochberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` How can you get aggravated at them for trying to save us?'' he asked.

 A man who picked up parcels the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had singled out as suspicious was charged with smuggling more than $ 500,000 worth of anabolic steroids into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, authorities said. About 135,000 doses of the body-building drug in pill and injection form were seized over the weekend, said <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, customs agent in charge in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` At one time, at one location, this is the largest shipment ever confiscated, we believe,'' <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coble </PERSON>, 49, was charged in federal court on Tuesday with four counts of smuggling and possessing the drugs for distribution. The charges are punishable by up to eight years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> was freed on $ 25,000 bond, said <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grotewold </PERSON>, supervisory deputy for the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's office. Authorities said a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> mail technician at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> spotted several suspicious looking parcels marked for delivery to a <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> post office box. After <PERSON> Coble </PERSON> picked up the parcels and was arrested, authorities found lists indicated he had customers throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to a customs affidavit. `` Steroid seizures have been increasing rapidly during the past three years, with about a tenfold increase every year,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hensley </PERSON>, assistant regional commissioner for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` Last year, customs seized over 2 million units of steroids nationwide.'' Steroids are used to increase strength and muscle bulk, making them popular among body builders. They are illegal if bought, sold or imported without a prescription. Health experts say prolonged use of the drug without proper medical supervision can contribute to heart trouble, sexual and reproductive disorders, immune deficiencies, liver problems, psychological disturbances and growth disorders.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> relieved 15 recruiters and their commander of their duties in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> for alleged violations, including fabricating high school diplomas for recruits, a newspaper reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> quoted Marine Maj. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, a corps spokesman at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, as saying that six of the recruiters face courts-martial on charges that will be filed within the next few weeks. Punishment for the nine others ranged from forfeiture of pay to letters of reprimand, he said. Investigators found recruiters provided as many as 17 diplomas for recruits who never graduated from high school, the newspaper said. In addition, the criminal records of some recruits were omitted from enlistment papers, as were medical problems that could have disqualified recruits from serving, the Press said. The investigation began in January after a suburban <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> recruit became ill at boot camp on <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and had to be hospitalized for a severe ulcer his mother says she reported to the recruiter, the newspaper said. Investigators later identified 82 others who may have been recruited improperly. Thirty of the 83 recruits were discharged because of enlistment problems, <PERSON> McLean </PERSON> said. The Corps retained 49 and has yet decided what to do with the others. The head of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> recruiting office, Maj. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eberhart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was relieved Feb. 14 of duties he had held since 1986.

<HEAD>Libya Could Easily Share Chemical Weapons: Webster</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said Wednesday Libyan strongman <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s chemical weapons plant is so big that he could easily share its output with other radical nations. `` The production capability is far more than Col. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> could ever need or use by any stretch of the imagination,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Is this going to become just another form of currency, ... a brokering capability?'' he asked. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> could have the capacity of targeting such countries as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with chemical weapons if <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s forces obtain air-to-air refueling capacity for their bombers. `` It moves it -LRB- the chemical weapons threat -RRB- off the battlefields and puts it into the cities and strategic areas'' of the whole <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> was asked by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, if elements of the West German armed forces had aided Libyan efforts to obtain air-to-air refueling capability. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said he would prefer to discuss the matter in a closed, non-public session but told <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, `` You're right on target.'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> later declined to elaborate on his comment. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has said the plant was built to produce pharmaceuticals, not chemical weapons. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said that even if that were true the facility could be converted to manufacture weapons within a day's time The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director did say, as he and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said before, that West German corporations as well as those from other European and <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries have helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> acquire a chemical weapons production capability, and that it `` would have been virtually impossible'' for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> to do that without such help. But he said the West German government _ after a period of hesitation _ has become more willing to address the situation and is moving to tighten export controls on the chemicals and technologies needed to produce chemical weapons. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said that while there was an initial `` slowness'' on the part of some countries to accept available intelligence information that a problem of chemical weapons proliferation existed, that is no longer true.

 Actor <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, an outspoken opponent of mandatory motorcycle helmet laws, said Wednesday that his near-fatal crash had not changed his mind. `` I could be a vegetable'' if he had worn a helmet, <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said during a news conference, his first public appearance since the Dec. 4 accident. He conceded that helmets should be mandatory for riders ages 16 to 21. But <PERSON> Busey </PERSON>, 44, said he will continue to oppose laws requiring all motorcyclists to wear helmets. Claiming his position was `` pro-choice,'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> argued that helmets impair motorcyclists' peripheral vision, hearing and neck movement He said his brain surgeons told him a helmet would not have lessened his injuries. He had a visible scar from his right ear to the top of his head. `` I could have been more seriously injured'' with a helmet, <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said. `` I could have broken my neck.'' <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said he was suffering some `` post-traumatic amnesia,'' but that `` I feel real good to be here. ... It's good to be alive.'' He described his recovery as nearly 100 percent complete. He blamed his accident, in which his head struck a curb, on a combination of excessive speed and an oil puddle. `` If I had been going 25 -LRB- mph -RRB-, I would have seen the oil,'' he said. <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> said he is eager to return to work on the film `` Howling at the Moon,'' put on hold when he was injured. <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> underwent surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, then was transferred to <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> for rehabilitation. <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> gained fame from his performance in the title role in `` The Buddy Holly Story'' in 1978.

<HEAD>Excerpts from Deficit Commission Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are excerpts from the majority and minority reports of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which were submitted to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and congressional leaders Wednesday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MAJORITY REPORT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 As the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> approaches the 1990s, and with the economy continuing to expand dynamically, economic policy, shaped to some extent by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, should be designed not only to sustain economic growth in the near term, but to help create the national wealth that will be the basis for future growth. Budget deficits are a direct drain on the national savings pool. To enable investment to grow rapidly, either private savings must increase or the necessary capital must be borrowed from abroad. Nonetheless, the decade of the 1980s has been characterized by high savings and low spending in most industrial countries, contrasted with low savings and high spending in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including that by the federal government. Such imbalances can not be sustained indefinitely. One result of these spending-savings imbalances has been historically large trade deficits in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and correspondingly large trade surpluses in a number of other countries. Large trade deficits, like budget deficits, drain domestic savings as more and more of the income produced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> flows abroad. One factor causing trade deficits is that American consumers like to buy foreign goods, including capital equipment. American manufacturers should become more competitive and regain the favor of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketplace. Another objective is to increase investment relative to consumption in the economy. One of the best ways to accomplish this is to adopt the recommendation that the capital gains tax be sharply cut. ... Recent data suggests that the industrialized countries are becoming more capital intensive. The country that is the farthest along in this process, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, has a rate of productivity growth that is almost twice that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with real income growth also twice as high. Americans must significantly increase savings that, in turn, will be used to finance capital investment. Clearly, one task is to reduce the budget deficits and factors that result in the federal government being a drain on the national saving pool, and to do so without raising taxes. This should reduce the real cost of capital and stimulate even more investment demand. The next step is to set a course for creating government surpluses or at least inhibiting future government deficits while at the same time not inhibiting economic growth. This will be a long term process. Whatever the benefits of deficit reduction, the nation must not expect that a balanced budget, or even government surpluses, will solve all our economic problems. Comparing the economic performance of the key industrial countries over the past 15 years does not suggest that countries with the lowest budget deficits are those that necessarily grow the fastest, have the lowest inflation, have the highest savings rates, have the lowest real interest rates, or the lowest trade deficits. There are many other factors besides balanced budgets that could contribute to economic growth. Rapidly changing technology and products, newly productive economic centers, and increasingly integrated world markets suggest that an economic policy driven by a single goal is not appropriate. Economic policy should not only address the traditional concerns about capital investment and productivity in the industrial sector, but also such hard-to-measure items as productivity in service industries and educated labor forces. The budget should and will be balanced over time. Indeed, the administration's budget lays out one workable plan for eliminating the deficit. There are other alternatives reflecting different priorities, but with equal or greater spending restraint, that could balance the budget by fiscal 1993, as required by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings -LRB- GRH -RRB-, without raising taxes. ... The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has been working on this project for approximately 11 months. We have heard from 85 witnesses and read over 1,300 responses from private citizens and groups. Our mandate was to recommend ways to eliminate the budget deficit while not impeding economic growth. It is clear that the president would prefer to coordinate this activity with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on a one-to-one basis. Indeed, this is the manner in which this process should proceed. We should continue to reduce the deficit as a percentage of GNP. We support the position that the deficit can be resolved through restraints on the growth of federal spending without increasing taxes or affecting low income, means-tested benefits. Therefore, we recommend restraining spending increases while keeping growth strong as the mainstay of budget policy. With an estimated $ 82 billion in additional revenues in fiscal year 1990, it is clear that we do not have to and should not raise taxes but, rather, should restrain the rate of growth in federal spending. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit targets represent arbitrary but appropriate goals for budget policy over the next several years. These goals, if realized, will be attained without any new tax measures and should result in a federal deficit that continues to decline significantly and consistently. ... We believe budget process reform should be an integral part of any deficit reduction plan. Any agreement on the budget should be accompanied by process reform to rebuild public confidence in national fiscal and monetary policy. ...

<BYLINE>MINORITY REPORT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was given the responsibility for making specific, bipartisan recommendations regarding: _ Methods to reduce the federal budget deficit while promoting economic growth and encouraging saving and capital formation, and _ A means of ensuring that the burden of achieving deficit-reduction goals does not undermine economic growth and is not borne disproportionately by any one economic group, social group, region or Deficit reduction is a relatively short-term objective, in that the goal is to achieve a balanced budget within five years. Promoting economic growth implies a perspective that extends into the 21st century. The realities of the political constraints faced by the commission during the presidential election and transition period left no serious possibility of carrying out the first responsibility on a bipartisan basis. The Democratic members of the commission concluded, reluctantly and sadly, that the Republican members' understandable desire to support the new president's plan for achieving deficit reduction precluded any likelihood of bipartisan agreement. The constraints he imposed and his flexible freeze plan are plainly and simply inconsistent with ensuring that the burden of deficit reduction does not fall disproportionately on any one economic group, social group, region or state. The fact remains, however, that the majority of commissioners believe that our national savings rate is too low and that continuing large budget deficits and huge, seemingly intractable trade deficits threaten the nation's long-term prospects for strong economic growth. The views in Part II of our report are directed toward these longer-run concerns. What is at stake is how we as a nation enter the 21st century. We can either slouch into the next century, or we can march into it all flags flying. Our future posture will depend upon whether, in <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>'s term, we get our `` political arithmetic'' in order in the next five years. Getting our political arithmetic in order means achieving budget balance by fiscal year 1993 _ anything earlier being wishful thinking _ and moving into surpluses thereafter. The surplus goals are readily identifiable; they should be approximately equal to the combined surplus of the Social Security trust funds. There is no option in the sense of an alternative use for the surpluses. The revenue stream to finance the surplus already exists in the form of payroll taxes that are high enough to put the Social Security system on a `` partially funded'' basis. If the present practice of using these surpluses to pay for current consumption continues, the pressure to return to a `` pay-as-you-go'' basis will become irresistible, and the payroll taxes will be returned to a `` pay-as-you-go'' level. On the other hand, if we can summon the political will to save the surplus, we will transform our economy and secure our future beyond any present expectations.

<TEXT>
 The right wing scored a decisive victory in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s municipal elections and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Wednesday the voters had vindicated his refusal to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The elections Tuesday extended the power of his <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc on the local level and gave major gains to Jewish and Moslem fundamentalists. <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>, the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s best-known mayor, won a sixth term in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> but lost control of the City Council. A preliminary count gave religious parties 12 of the 31 council seats, up from 10 in 1983. <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON>'s One Jerusalem slate got 11 or 12 seats, down from 17; four went to <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and three or four to the secular <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. More seats on the council will give religious parties greater power to enforce demands that restaurants and theaters close on the Jewish sabbath, but <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> said he wo n't make concessions that `` do not conform to the will of the majority.'' At stake in Tuesday's elections were 147 mayor's offices and city councils. Labor won 54 in 1983, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> 26 and the rest went to local or religious parties. Final results are not expected until later in the week, but Labor estimates it lost control of at least 10 towns councils, including several in traditional strongholds. Most were taken by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, including five of the largest cities. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has been a major national force for 12 years, but Labor has been perceived as the establishment party because it controls such grassroots organizations as the trade union federation. <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday: `` We have definitely been dealt a blow, and I do n't want to underestimate its force. But five years ago, when we won a big victory in municipal elections, it did n't mean anything for the <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- parliament -RRB- elections.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, a small opposition faction for nearly three decades until it upset Labor in the 1977 national elections, `` is turning into a central party that holds the power.'' He said in a TV interview the voters had declared their support for his refusal to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Libration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> or accept Palestinian demands for statehood. `` The results certainly strengthen me and the headlines of the Israeli papers have already reached the world media and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and nobody can tell me I speak in the name of a small part of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> public,'' he said. `` They know I speak in the name of the majority of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> public.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in April. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Galnoor </PERSON>, a political scientist at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s linkage of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> issue to local politics was part of a strategy agaist mounting pressure to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. In a recent poll, 54 percent of the Israelis responding favored negotiations. In <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahat </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> won a fourth term on a pro-secular platform and in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, which has been a Labor stronghold, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Arieh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurel </PERSON> clung won narrowly. Voters in <LOCATION> Akko </LOCATION>, a mixed Jewish-Arab city that has become a symbol of coexistence, rejected Deputy Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, who said all Arab residents should be expelled. Moslem fundamentalists entered Arab elections for the first time, scoring dramatic victories over left-wing parties. About 400,000 of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s more than 750,000 <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> citizens were eligible to vote. The Islamic Movement swept <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fahem </LOCATION>, the second-largest Arab city. <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> flags flew over the city Wednesday and residents drove through town in their cars, creating a huge traffic jam, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> reported. Some Jewish leaders expressed concern about the victory by Moslem fundamentalists, whose advocacy of one large Islamic state in the region challenges <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. Arab analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> won support by building schools and clinics. `` It's not a matter of religion, it's a matter of services,'' said <PERSON> Lufty </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashour </PERSON>, editor of the Arabic-language newspaper Sinara in <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>. Noting the rise of Jewish fundamentalism, he said: `` If they are worried about the Moslems, they should by worried about the ultra-Orthodox. The Moslems are less dangerous than the ultra-Orthodox.''

 A woman whose 6-year-old son needs a bone marrow transplant said Wednesday she is glad the state will pay for the operation but bitter about how the state handled the case. `` It's a big relief. I'm just sorry my family had to go through this. No family should have to go through that,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said in an interview in her apartment as her son, <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Annese </PERSON>, fidgeted on the couch beside her. After the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying the state would not cover most costs associated with the operation, <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>'s plight became the subject of radio talk shows and led to a public campaign to raise money for the operation, expected to cost about $ 150,000. On Tuesday, Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> held a news conference to assure that Medicaid would cover most of the cost. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>, who lives with his mother and two brothers on about $ 800 a month in public assistance, needs the transplant to give him a chance to beat a precursor of leukemia. A bone-marrow donor has been located and doctors at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> are scheduling the transplant, <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said. The boy's mother said Wednesday she has not heard from state officials, learning the news from a radio newscast when she and <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> on Tuesday from a trip to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>. The trip was courtesy of the Make-A-Wish program for gravely ill children. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said at the news conference that the newspaper account was incorrect, resulting from a `` communications breakdown,'' and that the state's decision to pay for the transplant `` is not a new policy.'' However, Globe reporter <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hohler </PERSON> stood by his story and was supported by <PERSON> Derek </PERSON>'s lawyer and doctors. `` I do n't see how it could be a misunderstanding,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said. `` They -LRB- state officials -RRB- told <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> no, they told my pediatrician no and they told my doctor in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> -LRB- at the <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- no.'' `` They were n't going to pay for anything to do with the transplant,'' she said. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> made it clear he was tired of answering reporters' questions but said he felt `` great. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> was excited that a path was now clear for the operation. But she said he may only now be learning of the gravity of his illness. After <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> left the room, <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> said it was only Tuesday night, as the family watched news programs that had been videotaped for them during their absence, that the boy heard one of his doctors say he would die without the operation. `` And me and my sister both just looked right at him at the same time, because it was the first time that it was loud and clear, and we just did n't know what he was going to do,'' she said. `` But he just sat in the chair quietly and watched the rest of the -LRB- newscast -RRB-, and he asked me if all those people were helping him. And I said yes.''

 Allegations that at least two doctors during the past year improperly prescribed drugs for <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> have prompted an investigation, but the actress is not a target, the prosecutor's office said. The doctors could face criminal charges if proof is found for the allegations that excessive amounts of various opiates, barbiturates and stimulants were prescribed `` without medical justification,'' district attorney's office spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Albergate </PERSON> said Tuesday. He did not identify the drugs or the doctors, nor did he say what prompted the investigation. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> has not met with authorities, he said. The actress, who turned 57 Monday, appeared at a ceremony last week after a month-long seclusion and addressed rumors about her health, saying she hurt her back in a fall on a movie set last summer and it took a long time to heal. `` But I'm fine now,'' she said. The two-time <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> winner did not issue any response to the report of the investigation. Miss <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said in a 1987 magazine interview that she had undergone treatment for addiction to painkillers and alcohol.

 As <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> celebrated its 122nd birthday Wednesday, the history-minded recalled an incident that could be called the Great Seal Steal. Before <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> became a state on March 1, 1867, <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> was the territorial capital, and a lot of people there opposed the decision to make <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> the state capital. So they kept secreted away the 60-pound state seal. When the new Capitol was ready for occupancy on Dec. 1, 1868, according to previously published reports, then-Secretary of State <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennard </PERSON> declared: `` We'll have to steal the seal! There is no other way.'' <PERSON> Kennard </PERSON> hitched up his horses and set out for <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> on a Sunday. He entered the territorial Capitol, wrapped up the seal and stashed it under the seat of his buggy. He whipped his horses into action and by nightfall had crossed the <LOCATION> Platte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the line of demarcation between forces pushing <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> or <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> as the state capital. Early the next morning, he appeared on the steps of the new Capitol. There, on Dec. 3, 1868, he put the impression of the insignia from the state seal to a proclamation declaring the capital of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, County of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, and that it was `` open for business.'' For 121 years, that same seal has been used almost daily for hundreds of official governmental transactions.

<HEAD>Thousands Attend Mass Funeral for Massacre Victims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of mourners wept openly Wednesday at a funeral for 38 Sinhalese men, women and children who were shot and hacked to death by Tamil rebels this week, police said. The crowd of about 2,500 Sinhalese rice paddy farmers flocked to <LOCATION> Welikande </LOCATION>, a remote jungle village about 100 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, to mourn victims of Monday night's massacre. They dispersed peacefully after the ceremony, a police official said. The government led by President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> was represented at the joint burial by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Sepala </PERSON> <PERSON> Attygalle </PERSON>, according to a police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. The victims were buried in graves in an abandoned rice paddy. Funeral expenses, including the cost of coffins, were paid by the government. `` Almost every home has hoisted white flags to mourn the deaths. There is tension in the village, but police and soldiers are on alert,'' the police sergeant said. The victims of the massacre were all from Sinhalese rice paddy farming families. Most came to Welikande in the early 1980s as part of a resettlement program after their homes were flooded by the Mahaveli hydroelectric dam and irrigation project. The sergeant said that Tuesday night a child died of wounds suffered in the attack, bringing the death toll to 38 _ 22 men, five women and 11 children. Police Tuesday blamed the attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful of the Tamil guerrilla groups that have been waging a separatist war against the Sinhalese majority since 1983. More than 8,500 people have died since the insurrection began. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> denied taking part in the massacre, the third in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in 16 days. At least 81 people died in attacks on Sinhalese civilians. Welikande is in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>. North Central Province is predominantly Sinhalese, while <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> is about evenly divided among Sinhalese, Tamils and Moslems. Tamil militants say the government has been settling Sinhalese in the area to tilt the ethnic balance. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, account for 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by Sinhalese in jobs, education and the use of the Sinhalese language. Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, make up 75 percent of the population and dominate the government and military.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> made an extraordinary public confession of marital infidelity today but vowed to keep fighting to win confirmation as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary by invoking the words of the commander at the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>: `` I shall never surrender or retreat.'' In an appearance at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> also said he regards his weekend oath to quit drinking if he wins confirmation as `` sacred ... and I can assure you I will abide by it.'' Tower fielded questions about his confirmation ordeal as Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> conceded the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admininistration is currently short of the votes needed to ratify the appointment, and as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> announced his opposition. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was continuing to lobby senators personally in search of additional votes. Asked whether he had ever broken his wedding vows, Tower, twice divorced and now single, said, `` As a matter of fact, I have broken wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection.'' Tower's second wife, <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON>, alleged `` marital misconduct'' in court filings in the couple's divorce case. Tower's appearance marked the latest turn in the struggle by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ as well as the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator _ to salvage the nomination against solid Democratic opposition in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Tower has been struggling against concerns about his drinking habits, allegations of womanizing and questions over possible conflicts of interest stemming from his employment as a defense industry consultant. In his remarks, Tower also turned aside a question of whether his appointment was a political payoff for having headed a commission that gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a clean bill of health in the Iran-Contra scandal of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He said congressional investigators also found nothing to implicate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and said, `` I wonder what kind of payoff they're going to get.'' Tower showed flashes of humor and grit by turn at the press club rostrum. Asked how he felt about his predicament, he said `` a little bit like the fellow who was immersed in tar and feathers and was being ridden out of town on a rail. He said, really gentlemen if it were not for the honor I'd rather hitchhike.'' Asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn from nomination, he replied by quoting from the last letter written by Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, whom he identified as the leader of the Texans who fought and died at the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>: `` I shall never surrender or retreat.'' Tower paused briefly and said, `` I am a little sorry I brought up the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> analogy. It just occurred to me what happened at the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> just 10 days after <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> wrote that letter.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> defenders were wiped out by Mexican Gen. <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>'s forces. Asked what had angered him most about his confirmation fight, he said there were no clearly defined standards against which he was being judged. He noted that several senators have said that the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, as the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces behind only the president, must adhere to a higher standard. `` I accept that ... but my question is how much,'' he said. He then asked whether it is `` acceptable for members late in the evening who had a few drinks in hideaways ... to come onto the floor late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear deterrence,'' or to accept speaking fees, campaign contributions and paid vacations `` from special interests who have a vested interest in the legislative process.'' There was no letup in the political storm surrounding the nomination, as <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> charged Democrats with turning the appointment into a partisan struggle. The spokesman claimed some senators are `` starting to have second thoughts about the words they used'' to describe Tower. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> claimed progress for the administration lobbying campaign, as well. `` We do n't have 50 votes yet. But we're moving in that direction, and I'll be the 51st,'' he said, referring to his ability to cast a tie-breaking vote in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where the Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage. Key Republicans said they would meet later in the day to decide whether to seek a delay in the beginning of the debate on the nomination, which has drawn widespread opposition from Democrats. Tower has been battling questions about his drinking habits, allegations of womanizing and concerns about his acceptance of thousands of dollars in defense consultants' fees, and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> addressed those issues in his speech ion the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat said he was troubled by Tower's work as a defense consultant. `` He received payment while it was widely assumed that he might be a nominee for defense secretary if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were elected,'' the Democratic leader said. Turning to the controversy over Tower's personal conduct, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said `` it is not moral perfection or the qualifications of senators that are at issue here.'' `` Public officials have a right to a private life,'' he said. `` They do not have a right to engage publicly in behavior which could interfere with the discharge of their public duties.'' `` A single lapse in judgment _ or perhaps even a few _ should not disqualify an individual from public service,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> continued. `` But when the lapses in judgment form a pattern of many incidents spanning many years, and when there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the pattern has been broken, then there are reasonable grounds to question whether the individual possesses the qualities necessary for the uniquely demanding job of the secretary of defense.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s position was widely anticipated, particularly since all Democrats who have expressed an opinion on the nomination have opposed it, and almost all Republicans have endorsed it. But at the same time, the Democratic leader said he hoped the Tower struggle would not have `` an adverse impact on relations'' between the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the administration. `` I do not believe any senator's decision should be based upon partisan considerations,'' he said. `` This is a personal decision for each senator to make ...'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made his comments during a photo session with Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>. Asked if Tower's nomination could still be salvaged, he said, `` I think so. I hope so.'' He said he was not worried about <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> operations, saying, `` The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is ongoing right now'' under acting Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> IV. `` There will not be any interruption until we get a new secretary of defense,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The White House vowed to fight on in Tower's behalf, and <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be meeting with `` one or two senators'' on the question today. `` We're still hopeful. We're still going to keep working it ... We'll just keep up the good fight and see how it goes,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The debate over Tower has become increasingly partisan in recent days. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, after a meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House on Tuesday night, said the opposition `` is an affront to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who was elected last November to make these nominations.''

 Hundreds of cooking professionals at a gastronomic gathering this week concentrated on the chemistry of cooking and the history of their craft, but they did n't neglect the savory stuff: 144 ways to prepare chocolate. Some seminars explored centuries-old techniques that are back in vogue; others taught how to reconcile cooking methods of the past with today's busy, hurried careerists. One answer: video shopping to replace time-consuming trips to the supermarket. `` People still want Momma's cooking but they do n't want to spend time doing it,'' <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Natenshon </PERSON>, a convention official and cooking consultant, said Wednesday. `` History to High Tech,'' the 11th annual gathering of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professionals </ORGANIZATION>, joins chefs, restaurant owners and food writers on a wide mix of subjects from the gastronomy of grains to formulas for preparing chocolate. Convention participants will attend workshops on such topics as `` The Future of Food'' and `` Can Recipes Travel Through Time?'' Seminars in Chinese cooking showed how the ancient method of cooking food over smoldering tea leaves is still in style. `` Smoking and grilling are ancient technologies but they're also the wave of the future,'' <PERSON> Natenshon </PERSON> said. `` They add a different kind of flavor, like Cajun cooking.'' Several participants said they came to `` network'' as well as to learn about cooking. `` I think the most exciting thing is that people who like to eat are people who like life,'' said <PERSON> Janeen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarlin </PERSON>, a cooking teacher who is one of nearly 400 participants in the convention that ends Saturday. `` If I learn just one thing, some new way of doing something this week, it'll be worth it.'' The convention could get a little technical. For example, an early workshop in `` High-Tech Tips for Fail-Safe Recipes'' was clearly not for the kind of cook who relies on Hamburger Helper or macaroni and cheese. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Corriher </PERSON>, an Atlanta-based cooking instructor and food consultant held a roomful of students in thrall for two hours as she addressed common cooking problems. First, she distributed lecture notes that included a section on the `` basics of emulsion.'' `` There are 128 or more sugars found in caramel,'' she said, while whipping up fish, chocolate sauce and a cake brioche. `` And the big secret for flakiness is ` cold, cold, cold.' ... You've got to get chocolate up to 118 degrees but you ca n't get it over 120 or it separates out.'' But it's not all hard work. Participants sampled some of the goodies and will be allowed to kick up their heels during `` Wine Tasting _ A Personal Sensory Analysis,'' `` Ways With Walnuts,'' or the `` Fisherman's Feast,'' billed as the `` finale'' which includes a `` bounty of fish from the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>'s `` Luxuriate in Chocolate'' was the most popular workshop, according to convention spokeswoman <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>, a renowned pastry chef and confectioner, designed menus for the White House. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, the author of eight cookbooks, was one of 93 participants who signed up for <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>'s class. `` I like the master classes but it's really the networking that many of us come for,'' she said. `` Like if I have some problem with yeast, I feel a lot more comfortable calling someone across the country to ask about it if I've already sat down with them here.'' The convention borrowed heavily from its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> locale. Workshops included `` Traditional New England Cookery,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baked </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beans </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> Bread and Beta-Carotene,'' and `` Beyond the Boiled Lobster.'' And finally, for pressure cooker enthusiasts, there will be a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Presto pressure cooker, what <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Shelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> calls `` the poor man's microwave.'' It dramatically decreased cooking time by the use of high-pressure steam. The event will be duly marked during the convention with a 20-pound pressure cooker sculpted in chocolate.

The never-used <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> plant has waged licensing battles since its completion in 1985 and nearly bankrupted the utility with cost overruns and delays. As part of the Cuomo-Lilco agreement, approval is needed from the <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. At the moment, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> does n't have the three votes he needs from the five-member panel <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> could give <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> the votes. One of the slots on the panel is vacant and a second will be soon because the current member's term is expiring. Of the remaining three members, one supports <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s plan, one opposes it and one has taken no position. For months, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has had two nominees for the board pending before the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for confirmation. Last year, under the leadership of then-Senate Majority Leader <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, the nominations stalled as <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> battled over the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> issue. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> has since retired and been replaced by <PERSON> Marino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> could free up the nominations, and both votes are expected to be votes in favor of <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s deal.

<HEAD>Commissioner Says Don't Make Social Security Separate Agency</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Social Security Commissioner <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> urged a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Wednesday to reject legislation that would make the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a separate agency rather than a part of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` I firmly believe that making <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> an independent agency would hinder our efforts to continue and improve our record of high-quality service to the public,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> testified. `` What independent agency status would do is invite, and expose <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> to, direct pressure from interest groups, states, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' she said. If such a measure were to win eventual congressional approval, she argued, it at least should be changed to provide that the agency be run by a single administrator rather than a three-member board as spelled out in the bill under consideration. Although not taking a position at the hearing for or against the basic concept of making Social Security a separate agency, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> backed <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>'s call for avoiding a system that could result in management by committee. `` As we have testified in the past, we believe a more effective form of leadership would be a single administrator,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON>, director of income security issues in <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s human resources division. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> is </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' own watchdog agency, and <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON> was careful not to offend Rep. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security and lead author of the legislation <PERSON> Delfico </PERSON>'s reference to past testimony illustrated that attempts to make the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a separate agency are not new. The idea enjoys considerable popularity, particularly among House members, because of what they say is a widely held public perception that making the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> an independent agency would separate it from politics. Noting that he had been supporting such proposals for years, Rep. <PERSON> J.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told the panel: `` Despite the steady increase in the financial strength of the system ... too many people still doubt that the system will provide them with meaningful benefits when it is their time to retire. This is because, deep down, they do not believe that the ` politicans and bureaucrats' have the will to leave the program alone.'' Making the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> a separate agency would not exempt it from following the policies laid down by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which sets both benefit levels and the withholding taxes to pay for them. <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> introduced a measure to separate the agency in the 98th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and similar bills have been introduced in each <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since, including the current 101st. A bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> 401-0 in 1986, but was not taken up in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickle </PERSON> noted that the measure has little overt opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but `` for some reason or another it always gets bottled up before we get it out.''

<HEAD>Abandoned Plant May be Source of Disease at Trailer Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OCOEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Health officials are offering free inoculations to try to curb an outbreak of hepatitis believed caused by sewage flowing into a trailer park from an abandoned plant. Fifteen people, mostly children, have gotten the disease at the Palms Mobile Home Park in this <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> suburb since November. <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> health officials say the wastewater discharging from the abandoned plant that once served the park is virtually untreated and could contain the infectious hepatitis virus. Rain causes water to back up from the plant into yards and streets, where children play in it, said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Madden </PERSON>, whose 6-year-old daughter recently had hepatitis. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Segebart </PERSON> said Tuesday that sewage from the plant has been a problem since they moved into the park of about 125 mobile homes three years ago. `` It makes me mad, really mad,'' said <PERSON> Gina </PERSON> <PERSON> Segebart </PERSON>. `` I think the entire neighborhood is upset.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>, health department spokesman, said the shots of gamma globulin will give residents temporary immunity and lessen symptoms, which include fever, jaundice, an enlarged liver and intestinal problems. `` Our prime concern right now is there is a very real risk of transmission through raw sewage,'' <PERSON> Toth </PERSON> said. `` If we can break the chain of infection anywhere along the way, we can stop this thing in its tracks.'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Passiatore </PERSON>, an assistant county attorney, said a loophole in state law allows a private utility owner to walk away from a malfunctioning plant. The owner, <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Minton </PERSON>, said he abandoned the plant early in February after trying to sell it to <LOCATION> Ocoee </LOCATION> and to a private utility company. He said he tried to buy more land to expand, but the owners would not sell, and so he gave the county, city and regulatory agencies 90 days notice that he would abandon the utility. Under state law, the county became responsible for having someone take over its operation. County commissioners Monday authorized repairs until a judge can appoint someone to run the plant. A cleanup began on Tuesday. Something would have been done months ago if the mobile home park was not in a poor section, said resident <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. `` It is like we are not here,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Asked for Help in Work-on-Sunday Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged Wednesday to grant unemployment benefits to a man who says even though he is not a member of an organized religious group his Christian beliefs dictate he not work Sundays. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said his client's right to freely exercise his religious beliefs was violated by the state's denial of unemployment pay. `` The belief must be sincerely held and it must be rooted in religion,'' said <LOCATION> French </LOCATION>. But he said once state officials accept that a person's refusal to work Sundays fits those conditions it does not matter whether the person belongs to an established religious group or sect. The task for the justices, who are expected to decide the case by July, may have been complicated Wednesday when <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> officials changed the state's approach to the dispute. The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> previously said <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON>'s basis for not working on Sundays must be more than an individually held religious scruple. The belief must be based `` on some tenets or dogma accepted by the individual of some church, sect or denomination,'' the agency said. But on Wednesday, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Solicitor General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> was denied unemployment benefits not because of the absence of affiliation to a religious group but because his belief was `` personal'' rather than religious. `` The sincerity of a personal belief is not the same as a religious belief,'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said. `` Just because someone sincerely holds a belief does n't make it religious.'' `` Even if he says that it comes from God?'' asked Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> in a tone of disbelief. `` It seems to me you are just questioning if he was sincere.'' The state's shift in position also was challenged by Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. `` I do n't understand why you are making this argument,'' she said, adding that the state should have been forthright and `` confessed error.'' Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the state now seems to be encouraging the court to `` affirm a patently unconstitutional ruling.'' And Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the state appeared to be asking the court to decide that <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON>'s beliefs were not sincerely religious even though lower courts and state agencies had not questioned <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON>'s sincerity. <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits after he turned down a temporary job assignment in 1984 that would have required him to work Wednesdays through Sundays. He said as a Christian he believed non-emergency work on Sunday is forbidden. A state appeals court ruled against <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON>. It said, `` The injunction against Sunday labor must be found in a tenet or dogma of an established religious sect. -LRB- <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> -RRB- does not profess to be a member of any such sect.'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> made no attempt Wednesday to defend that reasoning. Instead, he said <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> failed to provide enough evidence that his refusal to work Sundays was predicated on a sincerely held religious belief. `` This gentleman may have sincere beliefs,'' <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> said. `` But there is not enough evidence to support it.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has held three times previously that states may not deny unemployment benefits to people who refuse work because of religious scruples. But in all three cases the workers based their claims on adherence to the teachings of an established religious sect. Most recently, the court ruled in 1987 that <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> authorities violated a Seventh-day Adventist's religious freedom by denying her unemployment pay because she refused to work on Saturdays.

<TEXT>
 As you cruise down the freeway and chat on your cellular telephone with your sweetheart, lawyer, bookie or broker, bear in mind that somebody _ anybody _ could be listening. The fact that conversations on cellular telephones can be easily pulled from the airwaves with inexpensive radio scanners upsets a lot of people, including a few state legislators who have proposed a measure to make eavesdropping illegal. Action on the bill has been put off for a year while a legislative committee studies it. At a hearing Tuesday for the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION>, one cellular phone user urged action. `` If there's no prohibition against listening in, why not just go to a CB?'' asked lobbyist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>. `` The point for me is that my phone is not like a <ORGANIZATION> CB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. I'm paying more to the phone company to use my car phone than to use a phone at my home.'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> is one of scores of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> residents who use a cellular phone, for which he pays $ 150 a month in subscriber charges. Attorney <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Senn </PERSON>, a legislative researcher, said either technology must solve the problem or lawmakers must address it. She said the problem will only grow along with the popularity of cellular car phones, which now are estimated to number 1 million in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Senn </PERSON> said legislators have heard from lawyers and physicians who are especially concerned at eavesdropping because some of their conversations are with clients and considered privileged. `` We're talking about a lot of sensitive phone conversations where people might not even be aware that somebody could be listening in,'' she said. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> acknowledged that a state law might not stop eavesdroppers, especially since a 1986 federal law, which carries a $ 500 fine for eavesdropping, seems to have had little effect. But he said at least `` bragging rights would stop'' among eavesdroppers who have been known to tape conversations and play them on commercial radio stations for entertainment. He said he heard just such a program recently on a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> station. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, another researcher for the legislative committee, said radio scanners with a megahertz band of 800 to 900 are capable of picking up cellular telephone conversations. He said the cellular phone industry is working on ways to scramble conversations with relatively affordable technology. European systems already are secure against eavesdroppers, <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> said.

 Indian-born <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, a British citizen, has been in hiding for two weeks since the Iranian spiritual leader sparked an international furor by ordering him killed. On Feb. 12, police in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> killed six anti-Rushdie demonstrators. A day later, a man in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was killed in a demonstration. The most violent protests took place in the western Indian city of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> Feb. 24, when at least 10 people were killed in clashes with police. In <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> on Wednesday, an organization of Moslem youths demanded that shops and businesses close in <LOCATION> Srinagar </LOCATION> in protest of the novel, news agencies said. Most shops, offices and businesses stayed open, the <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Police opened fire after protesters began throwing stones, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. At least six of the 20 injured demonstrators were hospitalized, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. Authorities said 15 policemen also were injured when they were pelted by stone-throwing protesters, <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Srinigar </LOCATION> is 400 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are among countries that have banned the book.

 Construction spending rose a modest 0.4 percent in January as work on non-residential buildings such as factories and offices offset a downturn in activity on government projects, the government said Wednesday. Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 424 billion in January, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. January's advance followed a a 2.1 percent increase in December and a 1.3 percent jump in November January's strength in construction came in the non-residential sector, where building activity rose 4.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 99.1 billion. Hotel and motel building was up 8.7 percent for the month, factory construction rose 7.3 percent, construction of office buildings was up 2.2 percent and work on religious facilities rose 11.1 percent. Analysts said activity in the industrial sector has been bolstered as manufacturers expand capacity to meet rising demand generated by strong export sales, although the pace of exports slowed during the last quarter of 1988. `` We are moving into a phase in the investment cycle where we are doing real capacity additions to our industrial base,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of the School of Business and Management at <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's an investment boom that's still on in the country.'' Residential construction rose 1.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 204.6 billion, reflecting an unchanged pace of building activity on single-family homes and a 3.7 percent gain in apartment construction. Apartment construction generally has been sluggish recently, held back by high vacancy rates and reduced tax incentives for investment in such projects. The category had declined 0.9 percent in December. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON>, an economist and editor of a construction newsletter, said building activity has fared surprisingly well overall in recent months considering rising mortgage interest rates. But while non-residential construction is likely to remain strong in 1989, the rising interest rates `` will make it virtually certain that housing will start declining fairly rapidly'' this year, <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON> said. Fixed-rate mortgages were averaging 10.78 percent last week compared with 9.87 percent a year earlier, according to a survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Government construction declined 4.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted $ 81.7 billion in January The largest category for government construction, highways and streets, was down 10 percent.

<HEAD>More Americans Filing Simpler Tax Forms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A growing number of Americans are filing simpler tax forms, apparently because the new tax law reduced or eliminated several beneficial deductions. The number filing the long Form 1040 is down 4.2 percent this year, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The number filing the `` short'' Form 1040A is up 7.5 percent; 6.8 percent more taxpayers are filing the simplest form, 1040EZ, than at this time last year. `` These figures suggest that many taxpayers who filed Form 1040 in the past may be switching to the simpler, shorter forms,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> said. The 1986 tax overhaul eliminated deductions for state and local sales taxes and two-earner couples, and began phasing out the deduction for consumer interest. It also reduced writeoffs for medical expenses, and for millions of workers it cut or eliminated deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts. Through Feb. 24, halfway through the filing season, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had received 30.8 million returns _ only about 28 percent of the 109 million expected to file this year. That is up 2 percent from the 30.2 million at this time last year. This year's receipts included 13.1 million Forms 1040, 8.5 million 1040A and 9.1 million 1040EZ. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> had processed almost half the returns and had approved refund checks for almost 8.3 million taxpayers, up 9in the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. Partly cloudy skies and mild temperatures prevailed in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11 below zero at <LOCATION> Warroad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, to 85 degrees at <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The morning low for the nation was minus 33 at <LOCATION> Warroad </LOCATION>. Thursday's forecast called for widespread rain from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> across the lower half of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> valleys to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> states, with thunderstorms heaviest over <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Rain also was expected from western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> across much of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, with snow from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> across the northern Rockies, parts of the <LOCATION> northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>.

Thank you, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, for that very kind introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, it's a great inspiration to me to see that there are so many people, particularly people in the mass media, with such a profound and deep-seated interest in defense management _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ which is what I will talk about today along with strategic review. And I know you're hanging on the edges of your chairs to hear what I have to say about those two particular issues. I think that this does n't really look much like a lynch mob _ -LRB- laughter -RRB- _ but as the saying goes, we'll know more later _ -LRB- laughter -RRB-. I'd like to speak to you today about problems of broad scope and long-term significance. In short, I'd like to talk about the questions that normally occupy the mind of a nominee for secretary of defense. It's clear that a majority of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people lack confidence in the way the Pentagon is managing their defense dollars. The president is extremely concerned about this attitude, and has charged me with restoring public and congressional confidence by renovating the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s massive management structure and conducting a fresh review of our forces. The primary responsibility of the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> is to ensure that our military forces are prepared, and the policies that guide them will ensure the security of the nation. His advice to the president and his proposals to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> need not be popular, but they must be right, for in no other agency lies the responsibility for the security of this country and the lives of so many men and women serving voluntarily throughout the world. The overall military force we've planned for is not the force we can afford. It is therefore imperative that the secretary of defense bring out every ounce of efficiency he can find in the department and ensure that fewer dollars are spent wisely. It really is as simple as that. Significant and painful cuts will be made _ cuts that are prudent, yes; cuts that do not endanger our security, certainly; cuts that reflect a thoroughly worked-out strategic design, absolutely; but cuts that will create a storm of debate both inside and outside the Pentagon. But then, we are prepared to face such storms. We all understand the budget crunch. The reductions President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and I have agreed upon are both necessary and significant. We've already determined that in order to meet the Gramm-Rudman target, $ 6.3 billion will be taken from the fiscal year 1990 budget. These cuts come on top of four straight years of defense decline in which our military budget dropped 11 percent in real terms. We must make certain that in making these cuts efficiencies are enhanced and our security is ensured.

<HEAD>WASHN: is ensured.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We should be proud of the significant and necessary resurgency of our military power under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. I make no apology for my support of that effort. And I look back with considerable satisfaction to the deep, bipartisan support that helped <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> regain her credibility in the eyes of the world. But the 1980s are behind us. We do not disparage the real achievements of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration when we note that the 1990s offer us some distinctive different challenges and threats and that our response to new situations will not be the fall back on old ideas. Now, that's why I've spent much of the past month in the midst of two important initiatives mandated by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. First, a comprehensive review of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s national defense strategy. And second, the development of a plan for implementing sorely needed reforms of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> management and procurement practices. Our review of the strategic options open to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has gone virtually unnoticed in the general clamor surrounding my nomination. It has been in the works for many weeks, and it is a very serious undertaking. Given the choices and the cuts that lie before us, it only makes sense to begin the administration by stepping back from our current situation to see the world as a whole and by assessing the trends of uncertainties that will affect global politics in the 1990s and beyond. Nothing would be more dangerous than to enter into an exhaustive reworking of our budgets and programs without first attempting to understand the threats and challenges that are likely to shape that future world. Moreover, we can not risk a dangerous mismatch between resources and strategies. Our review will ensure that that does not happen. In assessing our strategy, we must first look at dominant trends. Some are encouraging. Our friends and allies have grown in economic strength and self-confidence. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> seems to be undergoing unprecedented reform and has told us of a `` new thinking'' in foreign and military affairs. In <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the forces of democracy and the free market appear to be boldly on the march. But this is not the whole picture. The future of Secretary General <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms is cloudy, not only because their success is in doubt, but because we can not be certain what his reforms really mean for Soviet foreign policy until we see more concrete action. Moreover, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and other hostile states are procuring evermore lethal weapons that seriously threaten world peace. The sobering truth is that, even if the Soviets become less of a threat, the world will remain a dangerous place indeed. The defense strategy review has several aspects. The review will analyze how current trends and uncertainties affect the appropriateness and effectiveness of our national defense strategy for the 1990s. It will identify those elements that should continue to guide our strategy and those elements that should be re-examined. The review will address specific force posture issues in light of the re-examined national defense strategy and current budget constraints. The goal will be a military force that provides the most effective deterrent while offering the greatest competitive leverage for our defense investment. The review will examine how arms control can be used to enhance our national security objectives. It will examine the basic premises underlying our approach to current and prospective negotiations and ensure that they are consistent with our defense strategy and force posture.

<TEXT>
 The issues that we confront in this defense strategy review are some of the most difficult in government. We face critical choices in both strategic and general purpose forces, ICBM modernization, SDI, the manning and composition of our land, air, and naval forces, and the mix of active and reserve components. We must make sound judgments about what national security demands and what budget constraints permit. We must also take a dispassionate look at our arms control policies. As we all know, arms control is not a disembodied program, but rather one vital element of national security policy. We must be clear on the role arms control should play. Arms control agreements must enhance the security of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and her allies. In the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, arms reductions negotiations will complement our overall strategic design, not the other way around. Of course, as we review our defense strategy and capabilities, we must remember one critical point: Rebuilding our military strength over the past eight years was critical to our foreign policy successes. Maintaining that strength in the 1990s will be no less so. It would be shortsighted, indeed, to conclude that because we now seem face-to-face _ or seem to face a more peaceful world, we can neglect a critical reason for current stability: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s military power. The planet still holds serious threats to the free world. While there are hopeful signs, there is still more promise than performance. The challenge of our strategy review is to assess how, with limited resources, we can preserve our strength and our alliances and meet our commitments around the world. As our defense strategy review will mold the forces of the decades ahead, so too will it frame the most immediate concern of the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, reforming the way the department does business. I have said plainly and repeatedly before the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in July of'88, during my time with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, in my meetings with the president and his key advisers, and most recently, in my testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, that the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> must take a cold, hard look at its management and procurement practices. This is something to which the president and I assign urgent priority. At the president's direction, we are well into an extensive management review of the department. Over two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reported on the ways and means to reform our system of buying weapons. The president and I embrace the commission's recommendations and they will be implemented with the utmost urgency that they require. Over the years, literally mountains of paper and seas of ink have been given over to management reform reports. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has no intention of adding yet another hollow call for a change. The president wishes us to build on the best from the past, to take account of current realities, and to give him by May a course of action for fundamental reform. We will detail specific actions that need to be taken to implement changes in four key areas: People and organization; defense planning, acquisition practices and procedures; and government-industry accountability. We know that our system for buying weapons is encumbered by too many people and too many layers of bureaucracy. There must be cuts. We know that running the department demands a highly skilled and professional military and civilian work force. Here, there must be improvements. We know that the system is choked by a thicket of laws and unspeakably ponderous regulations which cost time and money. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration must address the problem.

<HEAD>WASHN: the problem.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 We know that there are buying practices and procedures, identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a host of other experts, that can give us better weapon systems in less time and for less money. We must make the bureaucracy dance to a different tune. Allegations of corruption and abuse are all too common fare. The public's trust in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> must be restored. It must be made crystal clear that we have zero tolerance of abuses and abusers. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> sometimes moves like an arthritic turtle, and can find the most innovative ways to maintain business as usual. That has got to stop. The defense bureaucracy can be reshaped, but only if people can be mobilized into action. Leadership can energize the individual initiative of every man and woman in the department and shift the course of events. In managing the department, subordinates must have the authority and the backing to do their jobs effectively. They should be held strictly accountable for the results of their decisions. The issue here, of course, is one of competence and integrity. These attributes are not lacking in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, and they need only to be tapped by an aggressive and hard-nosed secretary. The same high standard of accountability should extend to the private sector as well. We can not tolerate people in government or industry who fail in their responsibilities to the men and women of our armed forces. Our military depends on nuts and bolts and sheet metal. We can not be satisfied by anything but the best. Our attitude must be one of zero tolerance of abuses of the system. The guilty will bear the full brunt of the law. These efforts can not take second place in the secretary's mind. They must sit at the center of his desk. They must be his day-to-day concern. I have no illusions that the way the department should be handled will make the secretary a universally loved individual. Popularity, as you may have gathered, has never been my strong suit. But, perhaps that in itself should be a powerful recommendation. As some of you have suggested in your news reports, I've spent a great deal of time thinking about what I might do as secretary of defense.

<TEXT>
 I've shared my philosophy with the president, now let me address this larger audience. The secretary of defense is a profound responsibility in terms of the global scope of his concerns. In a narrower sense, however, the secretary makes decisions that, taken together, determine whether our nation has the wherewithal to act when we must. Defense decisions can have no criterion save the preparedness of our military forces. There can be no favorite weapons, only effective weapons. Each service must understand that the secretary of defense is a person who can and frequently does say no. And under current conditions, `` no'' is a word that must slip easily off the secretary's tongue. There can be no favorite contractor, only effective and honest ones. Defense contractors by their performance earn the responsibility _ yes, the responsibility _ to craft <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s weapons. The secretary of defense must select and lead top-notch subordinates to fulfill his mandate. Indicative of the leaders the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will recruit is our candidate for deputy secretary, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON>. A proven <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> leader with extensive engineering and managerial experience, Mr. <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> exemplifies the high standard we will demand in our defense appointees. And let me note that one of the things that recommend <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwood </PERSON> is his experience with the defense industry. In his position as in others, ignorance of the defense industry is no virtue. Ultimately, however, the secretary of defense is in charge. He will be the person who must ensure that the president's vision and sound principles are brought to bear in defense decisions. He must ensure that the hard choices are faced, the necessary cuts are made, the necessary reforms are carried on. And he will accept responsibility for the results of his stewardship. A secretary, of course, can not escape controversy. But if he makes sound choices, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will be the first to applaud. When billions had to be backed out of the defense budget, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> decisively cut programs and force structure, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> properly praised him for his doing business as usual. A `` business as usual'' secretary is not good enough. I want it said, `` Tower never flinched.'' Major and expensive systems will not survive the defense strategy review. I can not give you a `` cut list'' of weapons because such cuts should follow, not precede, our strategy review.

<HEAD>East Germans Say They're Turning Tanks into Farm Equipment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will convert some tanks into farming equipment and transport vehicles as part of plans to reduce its armed forces, a government newspaper said Wednesday. The newspaper report also intensified East German pressure on <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to match a flurry of disarmament initiatives launched by the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Deputy Defense Minister, Gen. <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Streletz </PERSON>, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> newspaper as saying the elimination of 600 tanks would begin in May. Some will be scrapped while others will be converted to farm, construction and coal-carrying vehicles, the newspaper said. Calling it a unilateral disarmament move, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in January announced plans to reduce the number of its troops by 10,000 _ or about 6 percent _ by the end of next year, and muster out six tank regiments as well as a fighter squadron. <PERSON> Streletz </PERSON> said 80,000 troops were being discharged by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. He said more than 2,700 tanks and 800 warplanes would be eliminated by `` these socialist brother countries.'' The Soviets have also announced they are pulling out about 50,000 of their own troops from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries including <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The East bloc initiatives have put tremendous pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to come up with its own disarmament proposals to match those of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. <PERSON> Streletz </PERSON> charged that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> was `` continuing to hold onto its aggressive concepts,'' Neues Deutschland reported. `` We hope these -LRB- <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact measures -RRB- provide a stimulus for other <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries to take their own steps toward decreasing their military potential,'' he was quoted as saying.

 But in making those cuts, I will not succumb to the temptation of stretchouts and postponing the tough decisions, nor will I assume that any weapon or any force structure is sacrosanct. With clear policy direction and consistent oversight, the personnel of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should be given the chance to do their jobs to the best of their ability. We have over 2 million willing, capable, and dedicated people in the department who, if given the chance, can play a major role in providing for a strong and fiscally sound national defense. I intend to give them that opportunity and to hold them, as I ask you to hold me, accountable for the results. Thank you very much. I'll be delighted to respond to your questions. Q. Thank you very much, senator. We do have a few questions here. I'd like to begin with one. Senator <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> this morning announced his opposition to your nomination. The majority leader's vote carries a great deal of weight Can your nomination make it in light of it? A. I believe that the majority leader also said that individual senators should make up their own minds, or words to that effect. So, I do n't believe that he's trying to put the hammer on anyone _ or I would not guess that he is, based on statement that individual senators should come to their own conclusions. Q. Senator <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> this morning said you had made pledges to abstain from alcohol before and broken them. Can we believe the latest one? A. I do n't know what Senator <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> is referring to. I do n't recall any such. But the fact is this is not a pledge, it is an oath that I have taken _ have taken for, to, and before the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. And I regard such oaths as sacred. And I can assure you I will abide by it. Q. You said Sunday you've never broken a pledge in your life. Does this include wedding vows? A. As a matter of fact, I have broken wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection. Q. Senator, have you considered waiving the privacy provisions of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report so that portions of it could be released to the public? A. It's not up to me to waive the privacy provisions. The privacy provisions, I think, apply essentially to the people who were interviewed, and I do n't think it's within the purview of my power to waive anything. I have not seen the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report, I do n't know what's in it and I ca n't comment on _ really on _ or express any attitude on what should be done with the report in terms of revealing sections of it or all of it or a redacted version of it. I simply have no way of making a judgment.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has lost $ 50 million in business since Jan. 1 due to a three-month strike by jet mechanics over training, pay and work benefits, the airline's president said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Narcis </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreu </PERSON> also told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s industry committee the recent discovery of nine cases of sabotage of jets had forced extra inspections and the cancellation of at least 10 transoceanic flights, costing $ 4.3 million. <PERSON> Andreu </PERSON> took pains, however, to avoid blaming the sabotage on the 1,600 members of the the <ORGANIZATION> Spanish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintenance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technicians </ORGANIZATION> who have carried out many one-day strikes since Dec. 23. <PERSON> Andreu </PERSON> also said it had 7.3 percent fewer passengers between Jan. 1 and Feb. 27, compared with the same period last year. He attributed the drop to the 25 percent reduction in its 350 to 450 daily flights since January caused by the mechanics' strike. The union has pressured <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> for a separate agreement to guarantee training to meet international specifications out of fear its members could lose their jobs in 1993 when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> creates a unified labor pool and establishes common labor standards. The jet mechanics form part of a contract that includes the company's 21,000 ground employees. <PERSON> Andreu </PERSON> said he would not agree to the mechanics' union demands for a separate agreement because it would lead to calls by other groups within the ground employees for separate agreements, `` increasing conflicts in negotiations and eventually reducing the company's competitivity.'' He said 100 of the unions' mechanics had been fired for failing to meet minimum services decreed by the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> on strike days. Another 353 mechanics had been sanctioned for disciplinary reasons, he said.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has banned imports of cigarettes and tobacco due to the high cost of imports and scarce foreign exchange, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said that details on the ban, such as when it took effect, were not available, but reported that the ban was announced by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> during a one-day seminar in the tobacco-growing town of <LOCATION> Tirtash </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> Mazandaran </LOCATION> province. It said that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> imported 15,400 tons of tobacco and cigarettes during 1985-86 at a cost of $ 124.4 million, mainly from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. But during a five-year period, starting in 1982, tobacco production in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> grew from 21,000 tons per year, to 24,000 tons, the agency said. Iranians can purchase cigarettes with government-issued coupons for $ 4.50 per pack, the agency reported. But in the flourishing black market the better brands of locally made cigarettes cost as much as the equivalent of $ 15 a pack. Smuggled, U.S.-made Winston cigarettes, fetch the premium price of about $ 18 per pack. Soaring prices have forced many smokers to buy single cigarettes, which are sold at roadsides by enterprising men who buy cigarette coupons from non-smokers and sell single cigarettes to make a greater profit. Last year, the joke among Iranian smokers was that if cigarette prices rose any higher, they would find roadside kiosks selling single puffs of cigarettes.

<HEAD>Government Criticized for Food-Poisoning Scare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A parliamentary committee criticized the government Wednesday for its handling of a salmonella-in-eggs crisis triggered by a junior minister's remark that most British egg production was infected. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said `` the likelihood of an egg being infected with salmonella is very small'' but cautioned that a sharp rise in salmonella poisoning cases from 10,000 in 1981 to 23,000 in the first 10 months of 1988 was `` cause for concern.'' Egg sales fell 60 percent after the junior health minister, <PERSON> Edwina </PERSON> <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, said Dec. 3 that most egg production was infected with salmonella. Confronted by lawsuits from farmers, Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON> resigned, but the affair prompted a major public debate about food hygiene. The committee said the government, and not just Mrs. <PERSON> Currie </PERSON>, was to blame from failing to correct her `` wrong'' remark. Critics have accused the government of siding with food producers, neglecting the interests of consumers and issuing conflicting statements that confused the public. Last month, the government ordered an inquiry into food safety after warning pregnant women against eating soft cheeses and ordering farmers to slaughter salmonella-infected chickens. Health Secretary <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said Wednesday the government had issued health warnings `` that were very clear.'' `` I accept that we have got to do more to tell people about the safe handling of food,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> `` shares the concern of the rest of the government that the health of the public is properly protected and British farming produces high quality food and also that ... we keep things in proportion,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. The committee said `` more should have been done sooner'' by the government to prevent eggs entering the food chain from farms responsible for poisoning outbreaks. It urged the government to spend more on research to counter food poisoning, bring in better procedures for tracing outbreaks to their source and reduce contamination in animal foodstuffs. The government's chief medical officer, Sir <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Acheson </PERSON>, said in January that salmonella in eggs is a serious health problem but `` only a very few eggs are infected.''

 Q. As head of the <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigating the Iran-Contra affair, you gave <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a clean bill of health. Some say your nomination is a payoff for that and that's why he is sticking with you in the face of strong opposition. Your comment? A. I think that when you consider the fact that the commission was made up of three people, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON> in addition to myself, that that would be sort of impugning the integrity of Brent Scowcroft and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Muskie </PERSON>. I do n't know whether the questioner intended to impugn them because I had an equal voice with them on this report. We found nothing to implicate the vice president. I might add that the joint congressional committee found nothing to implicate the vice president. I wonder what kind of payoff they're going to get. Q. One <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> columnist, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Germond </PERSON>, this morning on the `` Today'' program said you were not a cuddly or very well-liked member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> when you were there. Do you think that the lack of affection of your former colleagues is playing an inordinate role in your current crisis? A. Well, that would only be guesswork on my part. As a matter of fact, I have heard various commentators say that some of my old colleagues had some scores to settle with me and were prepared to settle those scores. I do n't believe that's true. I believe it might be true that I'm not universally popular with all of them, but I do n't think that would be considered a motivation for their vote for or against me because I have some very good friends that hold me in deep affection and have told me so that are not going to vote for my confirmation. I know of some in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> who have said that they have very little affection for me who are going to vote for me. So, I would have to discount that as a factor. Q. Do you believe, as some apparently do, that the opposition to you is mostly partisan? And please explain what you think the Democrats would gain by opposing your nomination. A. I think it remains to be seen whether or not the opposition turns out to be totally partisan. I hope that some of my Democrat friends who've expressed privately to me that they feel I'm highly qualified and that they see nothing that has come to light to date to disqualify me, will vote for me. But I want to make an additional comment. I think if it turns out that way, that it's a significant development in American politics. I think it raises the question: Is character assassination a legitimate and acceptable means of the exercise of political power? If that question is answered in the affirmative, we have ushered in a new and rather ugly phase in American politics. Q. Do you believe the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s decision then on your confirmation will be essentially a political one _ President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vs. Senator <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>?

 <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> and two buddies in a fishing boat outraced thundering, 15-foot <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> breakers to rescue two people clinging to the hull of a capsized skiff. `` None of us was scared until we got back to the dock, and then we just started shaking all over,'' the retired welder said Wednesday after he and 18 others from 11 states and two Canadian provinces were recognized as heroes by the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, 60, of <LOCATION> Rockaway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said the incident on <LOCATION> Nehalem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on Aug. 8, 1987, was the most dramatic of several rescues he has performed in his life. `` We do n't have to do it. It's just one of those things. You take a chance,'' he said in a telephone interview from a dockside bait shop. `` I do n't know what it is. When you hear about someone floating around and you have a chance to get them, you do it. To save someone's life makes you feel good.'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, 41, and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Komlofske </PERSON>, Sr., 38, both of <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, were crabbing from their 21-foot boat when a distress call came over their <ORGANIZATION> CB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` We just dropped everything and said, ` Let's go!''' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. The skiff with five people aboard overturned in 15 - to 20-foot breakers two miles from shore The rescuers, struggling to hold their craft and maneuver in the breakers, managed to pull aboard <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, 43, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gochenour </PERSON>, 29, both of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` We went through a breaker about that time,'' said <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, the skipper. `` It went right over top of us, and then I could n't find the people anymore. I was scared I was going to run over the people who were still out in the water.'' <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> piloted the boat beyond the breakers, turned around and was attempting a second pass at the skiff when a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter arrived for the other survivors. <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> headed for shore. `` We had a big breaker coming up behind us, and you have to stay ahead of them,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` We had to outrun the last one.'' The Coast Guard saved two people. The fifth drowned.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it would keep talking to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and look for `` concrete steps'' toward peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The five U.S.-PLO meetings since December have been described by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as useless. And in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, he said Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> `` belong to the same family of demagogues and totalitarians.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>, declined to respond directly to <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s statement about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said it was the `` basic approach and objective -LRB- to -RRB- hopefully produce concrete steps that contribute to peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' At the last session, on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> criticized a raid by three <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, about a mile from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border. However, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> made it clear that the talks would be continued. `` This dialogue is not an end in itself,'' he said. And when asked to assess the results so far, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` This is still early going in the process.'' Meanwhile, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a deputy assistant secretary of state, indicated to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had provided useful information regarding counterterrorism. Asked by Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., about a statement two weeks ago by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top counterterrorism official that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had not furnished information on the Pan American jetliner that crashed after exploding over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in December, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> replied: `` I could n't make that same statement today. However, other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition they not be named, said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had not provided information on that flight. One said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> did not mean to indicate the information concerned the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flight. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> interview published Wednesday that if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> did on a 1977 peace mission, `` we'd put him in prison.'' Interviewed in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Arnaud </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchgrave </PERSON>, the newspaper's editor-in-chief, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader called King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, with whom he has offered to negotiate terms for an Arab-Israeli settlement, an `` element of stability'' in the region But, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, if a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state is to be established it should be located on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s kingdom stands. `` If the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> population one day decides to have a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state there, it's up to them,'' he said. Although <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> does not provide precise population figures it is believed to be at least 70 percent Palestinian. The <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, meanwhile, which <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> ruled from 1947 until the territory was captured by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 war, has nearly 1 million Palestinians and about 60,000 Jews. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> took a tough stand on these issues as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration pondered its policy toward the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, who is also a hard-liner, is due here for talks in two weeks with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> also may see President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Ending a 13-year ban, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> opened a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> last December, over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s objections. There have been five meetings so far in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> maintains its headquarters. Asked if the dialogue is a bad idea, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` I think it's useless Not healthy because it gives the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> more prestige and importance, and in such a way that it discourages moderate elements who would like to find a path to real peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said there were many moderate elements among the Palestinians. `` But when they see the Americans talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, they can not muster the courage to do anything else,'' he said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> were based on a judgment by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> had renounced terrorism, accepted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and subscribed to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions upholding the right of all states in the area to live within secure borders. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> did not detect any change in <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s attitude. `` History is replete with such phenomena who, after a while, disappear when they have outlived their usefulness,'' he said. `` Take <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. There was a time in the 1930s when <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> was celebrated the world over as some kind of savior. The end we know. But the price was a very heavy one.'' Asked if he were drawing a parallel between <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader replied: `` They belong to the same family of demagogues and totalitarians, enemies of the Jewish people, men who think nothing of killing millions to achieve their objectives.''

 A man who set his girlfriend on fire when she told him their relationship was over was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years and 10 months in prison, lawyers said Wednesday. <PERSON> Uilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyashiro </PERSON> was convicted Tuesday of attempted murder for dousing <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopes </PERSON> <PERSON> Afonso </PERSON> with alcohol and setting a match to her, defense lawyer <PERSON> Fabiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Curitiba </LOCATION>, 520 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>WASHN: Senator Nunn.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A. Again, I think we have to see this thing play out and make our judgments subsequent to the way the debate develops and the outcome of the vote. So I think it's perhaps a little bit early to comment on that. Q. Senator, what has angered you most about the way your nomination is being considered? A. When so many of my colleagues have said that I was publicly qualified _ or publicly said that I was qualified, and some Democrats who voted against me in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> indicated that, early on, they had intended to vote for me, and had complimented me on my expertise, my background and experience, and my record of leadership, that I suppose one thing that I think engenders some resentment is the fact that there was no clearly defined standard against which I should be judged. The standard seemed to be developed and seemed to evolve to fit the situation. Now, several senators have said that the secretary of state must adhere to a higher standard than members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. I accept that. I accept that the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> must adhere to a higher standard than members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But my question is, how much lower an acceptable standard is there for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>? Is it an acceptable standard for senators late in the evening who've had a few drinks in the hideaways and offices of the Capitol, a few steps away from the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> chamber, to come onto the floor late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear deterrence? Is it an acceptable standard for senators to accept honoraria, <ORGANIZATION> PAC </ORGANIZATION> contributions, and paid vacations from special interests who have a vested interest in the legislative process? I think, in the course of formulating a standard for the secretary of defense or indeed for any other Cabinet officer, that it is time that the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> articulated what its own standards are. Q. Would it be advantageous to your nomination for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to delay its vote? A. Well, that's a judgment that I ca n't make. There are some who say that an early vote might be to my advantage, others that say that if it plays out for a little while longer maybe the situation would change. I ca n't make that assessment now. I am not a prophet. And I've found that sometimes prophesizing is a dangerous business, so I will not engage in it now.

<HEAD>Purists Move to `Copyright' Neapolitan Pizza for 100th Birthday</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 5th graf to CORRECT date to 1889, sted 1898.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One hundred years after a <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> chef presented the queen of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> with a patriotic pizza, purists and politicians want to `` copyright'' the simple recipe for a genuine Neapolitan pie. Representatives from the Italian Association for Real Pizza, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Makers </ORGANIZATION> and the province of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> met Tuesday to define exactly what makes a `` Neapolitian pizza.'' `` All over the world, pizza is sold and consumed but often it is a product that has nothing in common with the original Neapolitan one,'' said <PERSON> Gennero </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambrosio </PERSON>, industry commissioner for the Province of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. `` It is, of course, impossible to ` copyright' a recipe, but to define the characteristic ingredients of real Neapolitan pizza is a step toward keeping a pizza with mushrooms or hot dogs on it from being called a Neapolitan pizza,'' he said. On June 11, 1889, a young Neapolitan pizza chef set out for the royal palace on a mule with his wife and a sack of ingredients to try out a new recipe on Queen <PERSON> Margherita </PERSON> <PERSON> di </PERSON> <PERSON> Savoia </PERSON>. The queen enjoyed the dish and asked the chef, <PERSON> Raffaele </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>, what it was called. `` It does not have a name, but from now on it will be called as your majesty,'' he is said to have replied. <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> had departed from the traditional pizza ingredients of the times: garlic, oregano and sardines or dried cheese. He instead used red tomato sauce, white mozzarella cheese and green basil, the colors of the Italian flag. So impressed was the queen by this patriotic culinary invention that she awarded <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON> a certificate of merit on display now at the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> pizzeria of <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>'s great-grandson, <PERSON> Vincenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandi </PERSON>. Real Neapolitan pizza, according to backers, is made with all fresh ingredients _ and, if possible, ones from the <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> area. The thin, crispy layer of dough is made from flour, salt and water and is baked in ovens fired only by wooden logs. The true kinds of Neapolitan pizza are the <PERSON> Margherita </PERSON>, and the marinara, which uses olive oil, tomato paste, garlic and oregano. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, 432 million pizzas are cooked each year in the more than 12,000 pizzerias in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Debates, ceremonies and festivals are being planned for the centennial this summer in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> to honor the city's pizza. `` The 100th birthday of the <PERSON> Margherita </PERSON> is the perfect opportunity to increase public interest in the purity of the product,'' <PERSON> Ambrosio </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Bush Panel Seeks More Ethics Enforcement Through Smaller Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ethics panel agreed Wednesday that adding lesser penalties will increase enforcement of conflict-of-interest laws, which now carry felony sentences. `` This is much needed,'' said former Attorney General <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, vice chairman of the panel. `` It takes a harshness out of the law and makes the law much more effective. Now when you have a close case, you just do n't prosecute. You do n't do anything.'' The panel's draft report predicted, `` By providing alternative prosecutorial tools that can be more carefully tailored to the offense, these sanctions may expand the number of enforcement actions.'' With a series of decisions at its fifth meeting Wednesday, the eight-member panel wrapped up all but the final drafting of a report it hopes to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> late next week. Most of the recommendations require approval by him and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The laws which prohibit federal officials from using their office for personal gain and which limit lobbying by former officials now carry felony penalties of up to two years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. The panel recommended that these and several other conflict statutes be given misdemeanor penalties and civil fines as well as felony sentences. Misdemeanor penalties can range up to one year in prison and a $ 100,000 fine. They said the civil fines should be the larger of either a specific amount set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or an amount equal to the financial gain the official reaped by violating the law. Civil fines can be imposed on the basis of the preponderance of the evidence. Criminal convictions require meeting the tougher standard of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The panel said willful violations should still be punished as felonies, but negligent or inadvertent violations should carry the lesser penalties. <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolsey </PERSON>, a lawyer and former undersecretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, said scientific and technical people considering whether to work for government have `` worried that any violation of these laws makes them a felon. It's far more reasonable if a mistake does not lead to a felony.'' The panel sidestepped the hardest decisions about what had become its most divisive issue: moonlighting by judges, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, top executive branch officials and top aides in all three branches. The members agreed there should be a uniform limit on the outside income earned by all top officials but called on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to set the limit and to let the President exempt some activities, like scholarly writing. Their compromise recommendation was that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> limit outside earned income to a fixed percentage of an official's salary. A majority of the group favored a figure closer to the 15 percent which now governs the executive branch rather than the higher amounts allowed in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the judiciary. The judiciary has no limit; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limit is 30 percent of salary; the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> limit, 40 percent. The commission also proposed that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allow the president to exempt income from categories of work that do not raise ethical issues or interfere with the full performance of official duties. This idea emerged after the commission tried but failed to agree on a list of exemptions. Former White House counsel <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> suggested listing teaching by judges, among others. But <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who wanted to exempt royalties from books or inventions, objected to exempting teaching by judges. `` When you get above 15 percent of salary for teaching, you're not a fulltime government worker,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said `` You're not in your office when you're teaching and you need to be there so other judges can talk to you.'' Other recommendations approved Wednesday: _ That political appointees should have to publicly disclose their home mortgage loans and debts to relatives, assets worth more than $ 1 million and income over $ 250,000 Those debts are now exempt from disclosure. The highest asset disclosure category now is over $ 250,000 and for income is over $ 100,000. _ That a three-branch commission, modeled on the sentencing commission recently upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, try to standardize ethics forms between the branches and issue advisory opinions on how to fill them out _ That a panel of private citizens be recruited to give the president non-public advice on questions involving the appearance of a conflict of interest which go beyond formal interpretations of the laws _ That the law authorizing independent counsels to investigate top executive officials should apply to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> as well _ if the law is retained, an issue on which the panel took no position _ That <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set up a joint ethics staff to give the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> uniform advice on ethical questions

 Q. Senator, you've taken a beating in the press. Embarrassing stories have been written about your personal life. What are your feelings about this? A. Well, I ca n't say _ well, I guess I should say I feel a little bit like the fellow that was _ had been immersed in tar and feathers and was being ridden out of town on a rail. And, he said, `` Really, gentlemen, if it were n't for the honor, I'd rather hitchhike.'' -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Obviously, it has not been comfortable. I think that there has been too much of an eagerness on the part of some aspects of the media to rush into print or on the airwaves with unsustained allegations. And, there's an old saying, of course, that the answer never catches up with the charge. The charge might be a four-column head above the fold on the front page, and the answer, when it comes, refuting the charge or rebutting it or disproving it might come back on page 23, somewhere in the patent medicine ads. So, it's not a comfortable situation. And, I think my own impression is that I wish there could be more balance. If I had to look at any single medium and say that that's an example of balance, I would have to recant some earlier things that I have said about that organization and say that I think that really the standard for balance and fairness has been exhibited by the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>.

 A gunman who entered a bank wearing a stocking mask was shot Wednesday by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent who was inside investigating a holdup that had occurred two weeks earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The unidentified agent was showing bank photographs of the first robber to employees at an <ORGANIZATION> AmeriFirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> branch when a gunman walked in, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office. The agent noticed the man was carrying a weapon similar to the one used in a Feb. 13 holdup at the branch and watched as the man demanded money from a teller. The agent ordered the robber to drop his weapon and shot him when he refused, and the fleeing gunman dropped both the money and his weapon as he ran outside. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitaker </PERSON>, 27, was taken into custody after he dropped to the ground in the parking lot and faces a federal bank robbery charge, officials said. He was listed in good condition at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Good News for U.S. Makers in Korean Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Last year's settlement of a trade dispute with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> cleared the way for rapid growth in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of cigarettes and leaf tobacco to that thriving Asian market, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report. `` Cigarette manufacturers have clearly won by gaining access to this market, which earned them $ 56.4 million in 1988 and holds promise for even greater annual earnings in the future,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. Shipments of `` unmanufactured'' leaf tobacco to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last year were valued at less than $ 10 million, but that was the most since <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leaf exports were about $ 40 million in 1981. The $ 56.4 million in cigarette shipments was the most ever. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarettes have historically faced stringent trade restrictions in this market,'' the report said. `` Prior to 1986, it was illegal for Korean citizens even to possess foreign cigarettes. This prohibition was lifted in 1986, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarettes continued to face tought trade restrictions.'' The restrictions led the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cigarette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to file a complaint with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative on Jan. 1, 1988, charging that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had violated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Act. Under the 1974 law, the president can take action, including retaliation, to obtain the removal of any foreign barrier found to be in violation of international agreement or discriminatory. Negotiations produced a `` record of understanding'' signed with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on May 27, 1988, which eased restrictions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarettes carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monopoly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, or KOMOCO. `` Now, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarettes are not subject to an import quota,'' the report said. `` Import and domestic taxes have been reduced further; restrictions on advertising and promotion have been reduced; price restrictions have been removed; and cigarettes can be distributed independent of KOMOCO.'' The report added, `` Soon after the agreement was signed, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers began to sign sales agreements with Korean firms, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette exports began to explode.'' In June 1988, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette shipments to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> increased 30-fold from May. For the entire year, sales totaled 2.4 billion cigarettes, or `` pieces,'' a 670 percent increase from 312 million pieces in 1987. `` In recent years, -LRB- <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> -RRB- cigarette consumption has increased an average of 5 percent annually,'' the report said. `` Increased consumption is attributable to the tremendous growth in personal income and increased consumption by women and students.'' The report also credits KOMOCO with `` an aggressive promotion campaign'' to help boost sales of domestic brands, many of which are using greater amounts of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco leaf.

 The head of the state's parole program conceded that it was a mistake to release a twice-convicted child molester who was arrested again this week on charges of abducting and raping a young girl. `` We made a bad decision on this case, no question about it,'' <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Probation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, 43, was paroled by officials both in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in 1987. He was arrested in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on Monday and charged with abducting and sexually assaulting a 7-year-old girl as she was on her way to school three weeks earlier. Twice before, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> was paroled after serving time for sexual assaults on children in <LOCATION> Palmetto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in 1968, and in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in 1976. In all, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> had been sentenced to 55 years in prison in both states and served fewer than 20 years. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said a probation officer recommended in a memo in July that `` <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> needs to be in a more structured situation than regular parole,'' and recommended community control with an electronic monitoring device. <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said it was only a matter of time before <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>'s sentence was to end. So the commission gave him parole on condition he attend a treatment program. `` And it did n't work out,'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said. `` We tried and the man violated. We tried to protect the community as best we could through some sort of formal treatment program.''

<HEAD>Speaker Says Report of Threats `Preposterous'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> condemned Wednesday as `` preposterous'' a published report that he had threatened to blow the whistle on a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> federal savings and loan regulator said to be homosexual. The report in Wednesday's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, made the threat in an effort to get better treatment for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> savings and loan institutions whose officials had complained to him, and that the issue had figured in the report of a special outside counsel investigating charges against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. `` The story ... is preposterous,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in a statement read to reporters at his daily news conference. `` This entire report is antithetical to my personality. I do n't threaten people.'' The allegation that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly sought to influence <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators is one of six allegations against the speaker that are the subjects of a nine-month ethics probe. The ethics panel is expected to announce some action in the case the week of March 13. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> acknowledged expressing concerns in 1986 and 1987 about regulatory conduct in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, then chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees savings and loan institutions. But he said the exchange was `` consistent with the work done by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> all the time.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he had submitted to the ethics committee an affidavit and a letter from two people present at meetings with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and other S & amp; L regulators in 1986 and 1987 who contend he made no improper requests of the officials. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not respond directly when asked whether he had raised with <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> the allegations of homosexuality, saying only that he would not `` indulge in rumors.'' Published reports and sources close to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> say the speaker expressed concerns at the time that a top <ORGANIZATION> FHLBB </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was pressuring state S & amp; L executives to hire the regulator's homosexual associates as consultants and attorneys

 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Wednesday warned critics of his austerity plan not to instigate protests similiar to the unrest in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the opposition and the `` Yankee empire'' would be the first victims of such an uprising. His speech came the day after the Sandinista government devalued its currency and raised fuel prices for the sixth time this year. It also followed days of front-page stories in Nicaraguan newspapers about violent protests sparked by similar austerity measures. `` If a situation develops here like that of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, if workers lose their heads and fall into the trap laid by right-wingers, if they lose faith in the revolution, they will rob and raid the establishments of right-wing businessmen,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. The leftist <PERSON> Sandinistas </PERSON> took power in a 1979 revolution that ended decades of the pro-U.S. <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> family dictatorship. `` If there is someone trying to sow uncertainty and instability in this country it is the Yankee empire through its spokesmen, -LRB- political -RRB- parties, radio stations, businessmen and newspapers, who clumsily launch that campaign without realizing they would be the first victims of the wave they're trying to stimulate,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said in a speech opening the new semester at a local high school. The president blamed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrialized nations for the economic crises in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. He said: `` In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, right-wing groups, politicians and radio stations speak against the economic measures, of the disaster of the Nicaraguan situation,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said. He called it the tolling of `` a bell calling the people to insurrection.'' `` They fail to understand that with these attitudes they are playing with fire, which could end up burning them,'' he said. The riots in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> came after the month-old government of Venezuelan President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> announced a sweeping economic reform package under pressure from internatonal creditors. Although <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> does not face the same pressure from creditors, it is suffering from inflation that hit 20,000 percent last year and <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s harsh austerity program resembles <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s in many ways The Sandinista program, announced Jan. 30, includes devaluations, cuts in public spending, higher fuel prices, massive layoffs of public employees, restricting credit and slashing capital investment. `` Our country demands effort, sacrifice and productivity from all Nicaraguans,'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Wednesday. He said his economic program is working and that inflation, which hit 97 percent in January alone was `` only 40 or 41 percent'' in February. `` We were expecting a much higher inflation rate, but our measures are showing results, thanks to the efforts of the popular sectors and of responsible businessmen,'' he said. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s currency, the cordoba, has been devalued six times so far this year. Each time the cost of food and fuel has risen, in part because food has to be trucked into the city from the countryside. The latest devaluation was announced Wednesday, with the official exchange rate now 4,200 cordobas to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, up from 3,800 cordobas. Fuel prices also rose 1,000 cordobas, with a gallon of gasoline now selling for 8,900 cordobas. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said that fuel prices will rise in the future but not by as much as over the last two months.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s determination to stick by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> in his messy struggle for confirmation demonstrates a remarkable premium on personal loyalty and a stubborn belief that a president is entitled to have the people he wants in his Cabinet. Despite allegations against Tower of excessive drinking, womanizing and conflict of interest with <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> contractors, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has never wavered in his support for his fellow Texan and longtime friend to run the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've made my call,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I've looked at the record. I've known this man since 1959 and my support is unequivocal. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is in my view the best man for this job.'' Thus, at the risk of a damaging political loss, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is heading for a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> showdown that he easily could lose. The episode threatens to sour a honeymoon with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that already has been strained by wrangling over the budget. The White House says the battle is stained by partisanship. But with the Democrats holding a 55-45 edge in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, a partisan fight is the last kind of test <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should want. It promises to get ugly, with Democrats and Republicans trading sharp charges and insults. `` Strategically, this is the worst thing that could happen to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The longer this goes on, the more people are going to say things they're going to regret,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, a specialist in the presidency at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. `` A new president should try to engineer an early, decisive victory when people are really noticing. He should do something he wins,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. `` It's almost as if <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has engineered a defeat.'' White House deputy chief of staff <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` believes the president should have the right to put people in the Cabinet ... unless it could be shown without any question that they are not qualified.'' In a statement aimed squarely at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Look, do what you've got to do but remember fair play, remember decency and honor and then remember also historically the concept of advise and consent, where reasonable doubt is given historically to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who, after all, is responsible for the executive branch of this government.'' Over the past 200 years, only eight Cabinet nominees have been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and never in the first stages of a presidency. After examining <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reports, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refuses to believe any of the charges against Tower and argues that it's wrong for anyone to be judged by rumors and innuendo. `` The president has known <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> longer than anyone in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has known him,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Trulock </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> vice president who was among a group of conservatives that met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` He knows, probably better than anyone, the senator's short-fallings and his strengths.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Tower have a long history of political favors. Back in 1960, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> chairman for Tower's first race for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. More recently, at the drop of a hat, Tower packed his bags during the presidential race to campaign alongside <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, particularly in the big battleground state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. When people were drawing up the names for a defense secretary under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Tower's name was always first. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s rumor mill has also buzzed with unproven speculation that Tower's appointment was a political payoff for having headed a commission that essentially cleared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of any significant role in the Iran-Contra scandal of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Tower brushed that idea aside Wednesday, saying congressional investigators also found nothing to implicate <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I wonder what kind of payoff they're going to get,'' Tower asked. Whatever the outcome, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has tried to limit the political damage by refusing to be drawn into a name-calling, finger-pointing fight with his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> opponents. `` The one good thing about the president is that he understands politics and he knows that most people do n't hold grudges and can move from one issue to the next without a lot of bias,'' said Card.

 Communities should be allowed to protect younger teen-agers by banning anyone over 18 from dance halls that cater to minors, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was told Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> is attacking the juvenile crime problem ... and the influence older people can have on juveniles,'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> argued in urging reinstatement of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city's age limits for patronizing certain types of dance halls. <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said local governments do not infringe on people's right to associate with whom they please by imposing such bans. There is `` no constitutional right of association reaching a dance hall,'' he said. Even if there were such a right, <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> added, the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance still served the compelling interest of protecting younger teen-agers. But lawyer <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, representing a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> dance hall owner, said, `` We are asking the court to recognize the right ... to associate even if the purpose is social.'' Although the word `` association'' does not appear in the Constitution, a long series of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions have recognized such a right _ including political and familial associations. But the court has never said that such constitutional protection extends to `` social'' or recreational associations as well. A <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> appeals court recognized such a right in 1987, when it struck down the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance that licensed certain dance halls on the condition only teens aged 14 to 18 be admitted as patrons. The ordinance made exceptions for parents, legal guardians and dance hall employees. The city appealed to the nation's highest court; a decision is expected by July. All nine justices asked questions during a lively, hour-long argument session Wednesday. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> seemed most impressed by <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>' arguments that, even if 14-year-olds have a right to associate with people older than 18, the city may create a `` safe harbor'' by inhibiting that right in dance halls. At one point, a seemingly dubious <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> why the dance hall age limits are any less constitutional than statutory rape laws making it a crime to have sex with a minor. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance was challenged successfully in state courts by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanglin </PERSON>, who operates the Twilight Skating Rink. <PERSON> Stanglin </PERSON> has a `` Class E'' dance hall license, issued to those dance halls catering to minors. He divided the floor of his skating rink so that patrons dance or skate to the same music in full view of one another. People over 18 can be admitted to the skating rink but not to the dance hall. Contending that the ordinance may betray many <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> residents' religiously based bias against dancing, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> asked, `` If the problem is older teens corrupting younger teens, why -LRB- are they only barred -RRB- on a dance floor? <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, smiling broadly, suggested that the city `` may be moving on roller rinks next _ one evil at a time.'' Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> voiced surprise when the city's lawyer said about 500 dance halls hold licenses. `` Do they do anything else in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> asked. The case is <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Stanglin </PERSON>, 87-1848.

 Members of a presidential panel Wednesday defended their plan to close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases, telling lawmakers the decisions were based on `` military value.'' The commission's co-chairs, former Sen. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., and former Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., also disputed lawmakers' claims that the decisions were based on faulty data or <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Installations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facilities </ORGANIZATION>, defended the Dec. 30 report of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Base Realignment and Closure. `` We did not just pluck these recommendations out of midair,'' <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> said. Disputing charges that the commission played politics, <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> added, `` Military value is really the touchstone of the process.'' <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> were supported by a top congressional investigator, who said he has yet to find `` glaring errors'' in the commission's data. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> were on Capitol Hill to fend off criticism of their report, which was proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to solve the politically difficult problem of closing military bases. The base-closing panel, planning to close some 86 installations and partially shut five others, expects its recommendations to save $ 5.6 billion over 20 years. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote within weeks on the recommendations, which must be either endorsed in whole or refused in whole. Most criticism has come from lawmakers facing base closings in their areas. Some lawmakers say the decisions are based on bad conclusions, and that transfer of some doomed bases' functions will cost as much or more money than they will save. Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>, R-Ky., said he orginally supported the legislation calling for the commission's report But <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> said he has been concerned by calculations that show the closures might not save money. `` If we're not, I'm not going to support it,'' he said. For example, the commission estimates reductions at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, will save $ 84.5 million a year. A report by the Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>'s office predicts the change will cost $ 190 million in new military construction, and $ 182 million in other `` implementation'' costs. Deputy Assistant <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, who provided the cost estimates, defended them. `` There is an old adage that it takes money to make money. For base closures, it takes money to save money,'' <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> told the subcommittee. <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> said the commission made its recommendations `` after serious consideration.'' Criticism was expected, he said. `` Change is not always welcomed. In fact, it can be threatening.'' `` We were heartened by the substantial evidence showing that communities do recover from the temporary dislocations that result from a base closing. Many end up much better off,'' <PERSON> Ribicoff </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., the subcommittee chairwoman, asked <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> about speculation some of the decisions may have been motivated by politics `` We were not only bipartisan. We were non-partisan,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> replied. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON>, a ranking official of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency has yet to find fault with the commission's overall recommendations `` We have not found any glaring errors,'' said <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON>, adding the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s review will continue.

 A. I have already outlined some of the terms of reference for our internal management reforms. Rather than try to go into detail with you because that's currently under development, I think I should simply say that we look forward to full implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> report _ the <ORGANIZATION> Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> recommendations, doing all that we can administratively, and then at the point where we have done all that we can administratively, go to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and ask for congressional help and whatever statutory relief _ statutory changes _ that are required to reduce the overlayered bureaucracy in the micro-management that now exists and the maze of statutes and regulations that are often in conflict with themselves I think what is indicated probably is a recodification of all of our procurement statutes. Q. Would you comment on the state of the current relationship between the department and the defense supply industry. Should it be improved? And how would you do that, especially in view of your own personal perceived conflict of interest by some? A. Well, in terms of my own case, that's a perception of an appearence. There is none because I have no continuing financial arrangement with any defense contractor. I severed all my relationships with them as of the first of December of last year, three months ago. And so, I have no continuing financial interests. I have no particular loyalty to any particular contractor. I think contractors must be held accountable for what they are responsible for. And I believe that we should insist on value for the dollar that we spend with them. And I think we should insist that they be honest in their dealings with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. And I believe that it's high time that they undertook a substantial policing of their own industry and embarked on a self-improvement program. And I think if that is not successful, then we have to impose certain disciplines on the contractors ourselves. Q. What is your view of proposals to use certain elements of the armed forces in the program to interdict drug shipments into this country? A. I believe that we should use them as effectively as possible. I think that unfortunately there are a lot of misconceptions about how effectively military assets can be used in interdicting the drug traffic. Some have gone so far as to suggest that we take the entire force of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> that is currently based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and deployed along the border. I do n't think that would be an effective means of the use of the military.

<TEXT>
 Politicians and right-wing activists have formed an organization promoting the re-election of military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who was lost a referendum last year on whether he should remain in office. <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, a former councilman in <LOCATION> Valparaiso </LOCATION>, said the group is made up of social leaders, independent politicians and members of various right-wing parties who are `` convinced that the best candidate we may have'' is <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. The group was organized Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Valparaiso </LOCATION>, 75 miles north west of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>. Several right-wing politicians and parties have also indicated they would like <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to run, but the <ORGANIZATION> Valparaiso </ORGANIZATION> group is the first one especially organized to promote his candidacy. The 1980 constitution bars Pinochet from seeking re-election, but in recent weeks the growing divisions among right-wing forces prompted calls to find a way for him to run in the Dec. 14 election. The election was made mandatory by an Oct. 5 referendum, in which voters overwhelmingly rejected a military proposal to extend <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s term until 1997. Supporters of a Pinochet candidacy say the constitution may be changed to allow him to run, and the general's wife, <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiriart </PERSON>, publicly supported such a constitutional amendment. Others say the constitutional restriction on re-election does not apply to the 73-year-old president and army commander because he was not elected in the first place. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> seized power in a bloody 1973 coup. The government announced last week that it is considering a plebiscite as early as June to approve unspecified constitutional changes. There has been no indication, however, that the changes would include one to allow <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to run in December. <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, one of two right-wing politicians who have formally announced their presidential candidacies, says he would only withdraw from the race if <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> can run. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has admitted he can not be a candidate under the present constitutional terms. He told his supporters, however, that he will tell them who to support in the presidential race.

 Jubilant Icelanders quaffed legal lager for the first time in 74 years Wednesday when prohibition laws banning the sale of full-strength beer officially ended. Lines formed outside some of the 17 state liquor stores that hold the monopoly on selling spirits. When the doors swung open at the <LOCATION> Snorra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braut </LOCATION> branch in central <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, there were cheers and applause. Two new pubs timed their opening day to coincide with `` B-Day,'' and many restaurants and bars reported their tables were booked up weeks in advance by Icelanders planning to celebrate their new freedom. In one new pub in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, The Beer Cellar, a bell was rung at noon and customers were asked to observe a moment of silence before taking a gulp. Alcoholic drinks became illegal in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> in 1915 following a referendum, and although prohibition was repealed in 1933, beer containing more than 2.25 percent alcohol remained outlawed. The weak beer never gained popularity, and Icelanders who wanted to imbibe legally often resorted to the national drink called the Black Death, a mind-numbing, clear liquid that is 40 percent alcohol and tastes like vodka. Parliament finally passed a law legalizing beer in May, and gave the island nation of 251,000 until March 1 to prepare for the change that ended <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>'s isolation from its ale-loving Scandinavian neighbors. After the moment of silence at The Beer Cellar on Wednesday, <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Sveinsson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Reykjavik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, cut a ribbon and enjoyed the first glass of locally brewed suds. Each customer got a free glass of beer _ no mean feat, considering that bars are charging $ 3.90 to $ 4.80 a glass `` This is indeed a world event,'' <PERSON> Sveinsson </PERSON> joked to the cameras, adding: `` I am convinced Icelanders will learn to handle beer, seeing as Icelanders have always been open to foreign cultural influences.'' He urged people to take buses home, citing lines from `` I Think I'll Walk Home,'' a song by pop star <PERSON> Valgeir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gudjonsson </PERSON> against drunken driving. The song, commissioned by the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION>, was been played incessantly on radio and TV before `` B-Day.'' Newspapers have carried ads warning that `` beer is alcohol,'' just in case any Icelanders have forgotten after 74 years. In Parliament a few days ago, Education Minister <PERSON> Svavar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gestsson </PERSON> accused the media of hyping the occasion. He said all efforts to educate the public about the evils of drink `` have proved in vain against this terrible flood.'' Police said they were on heightened alert for drunken drivers. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> prides itself on having relatively low alcohol consumption, but intake has jumped from an annual 6.7 pints per head in 1981 to 9.45 pints now. The state, which controls the liquor supply, is exacting hefty levies on beer. A 24-can case of imported beer costs about $ 57.60. The price was expected to be even higher, but the government decided it should not outprice hard liquor. Before legalization, smuggled beer fetched about $ 70 for a 24-can case. Beer of above 5.6-percent alcoholic content remains banned, and pleading lack of storage space, the government has also restricted the number of importers to three _ Budweiser of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Tuborg of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kaiser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Two local breweries are providing another four brands. Beer was completely outlawed until 1980, when the law changed to allow Icelanders arriving from abroad to bring in 12.2 pints of foreign beer.

<HEAD>Researchers Kick Off Dietary Study Featuring Salmon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the interest of medical science, 12 men have volunteered to dine on salmon every day for 40 days, stroll through one of the most beautiful areas of the city twice daily and get paid for their trouble. The arrangment is part of a 100-day dietary study conducted by the federal government to determine possible beneficial effects of fish oil consumption. Participants and researchers gathered Wednesday to publicize the study and generate interest in similar research. Entrees will include broiled salmon with dill, salmon pate on bagels, salmon lasagna and salmon teriyaki. If the assignment, which began with breakfast Tuesday, makes your mouth water, you're not alone. More than 2,000 prospective volunteers applied for the 12 slots. A public service announcement recruiting volunteers generated worldwide interest and media attention. But the 100-day stint has its drawbacks. Participants are confined to the dormitory-style `` metabolic unit'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Letterman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> at the <LOCATION> Presidio </LOCATION>. Constantly under the surveillance of staff, they are allowed only two hours a week to visit with family and friends. Their diets are strictly controlled. Every bite is monitored. The only unlimited substance is water, and even that is tabulated daily. Partipants not only clean their plates, they must scrape them squeaky clean. Along with forks and knives, rubber spatulas are provided with each meal. `` This is really a scientific study,'' said <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. `` They weigh everything going in and everything going out.'' On the first day, one participant drank the required glass of milk and sent his color-coded tray back to the kitchen. He thought he was done. Not so, supervisors said, handing him a spatula and requesting that he squeegee out the last drops of milk. `` Clean your plate takes on a new meaning,'' said project manager <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Blonz </PERSON>. But so far the food is drawing rave reviews _ and salmon wo n't be on the menu for 18 days yet. The first 20 days are spent establishing what researchers call a `` stabilization diet'' of balanced, low-fat meals with no fish. `` The food is excellent,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. `` Any one of these meals, if you bought it in a restaurant, you'd pay some bucks for it.'' Researchers hope that by feeding participants a diet rich in fish oils, they will be able to determine the purported beneficial effects of omega-3, or polyunsaturated, fatty acids. Unlike studies in which participants consume massive doses of fish oil in capsules, research chemist <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said this project seeks to replicate `` a diet people could eat at home.'' Previous research suggests that fish oils may be beneficial in the treatment or prevention of heart disease, cancer and other ailments, as well as in improving the body's immune system. `` You name it and somebody has claimed it,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. Salmon was selected for its relatively high fat content. Some fish, like <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> sole, is only about 1 percent fat, compared to salmon, which is 10 percent fat. And it tastes good. Late this month, volunteers will dig in to their first helping of King Salmon. Salmon entrees served twice-daily will provide each participant with about 25 times the amount of fish oil as the average American. Their daily regimen includes two 2-mile walks around the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base each day. The wake-up call is 6:30 a.m., and lights must be out at midnight. Volunteers share starkly-furnished double rooms, as well as a library, `` quiet room'' and day room, complete with stereo, VCR and pool table. `` I'm thinking about getting a pool tournament together,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON>, 31, a self-employed market researcher who lives in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>. `` Another guy is a carpenter and is going to be working on projects for his home.'' <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON> said he has always had an interest in scientific research and figured this way he `` could contribute something to science without being dead.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, continuing a selective relaxation of the security shrouding its newest weapons, released a photograph Wednesday providing a limited view of its new stealth cruise missile. The black-and-white photo shows a B-52 bomber flying with four of the new missiles tucked under each wing. The picture shows the missile has flattened sides instead of a perfectly rounded shape; that the engine air inlet is cut into the top of the missile instead of sticking up on a pylon from the fuselage, and the wings and tail fins are folded up against the missile body until it is fired. But the angle from which the photograph was taken does not allow any other details of the weapon's design to be discerned, and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it is not prepared to say more. Production schedules, budget figures and tentative dates for fielding all remain classified, said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Oborn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The release of the photo of the stealth cruise, known formally as the Advanced Cruise Missile, or AGM-129A, is the third such move in 10 months. Last April, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> released an artist's sketch that revealed the `` flying wing'' design of the new B-2 stealth bomber. Then last November, the service released a photograph _ albeit a poor one _ of the super-secret F-117A stealth jet fighter. Wednesday's release appeared to be tied in part to an upcoming test of the new missile over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> announced Feb. 1 that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had agreed to let the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> test the Advanced Cruise Missile in arctic conditions. According to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials, who asked not to be named, the first such test was scheduled Wednesday but had to be postponed due to weather conditions. The standard cruise missile is a jet-powered flying bomb that looks like a torpedo with stubby wings and a tail fin. The missile carries a sophisticated guidance system that allows it to hug the ground to escape detection. The stealth version of the cruise missile is supposed to be even more impervious to detection, while also offering greater range. The term stealth is applied to a variety of techniques used to foil radar. By employing unusual aircraft designs and new types of manufacturing materials, a plane or missile can absorb or deflect radar signals without bouncing them back to an enemy tracking system. Although most of the publicity about stealth technology has centered on the B-2 bomber, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has been under contract since 1983 to develop and build a stealth version of the standard cruise missile. The <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> received a separate contract in 1987 to become a second producer of the missile. Congressional officials disclosed almost two years ago, in April 1987, the stealth missile program was suffering from serious production quality problems and cost overruns. Although denied by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> has quoted sources as saying the program is three years behind schedule and will cost $ 7 billion instead of $ 5 billion. Acting Air Force Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, in a written statement released Wednesday with the picture, said the stealth cruise missile `` will improve the long-term effectiveness of the -LRB- bomber -RRB- leg of the -LRB- nuclear -RRB- triad.'' `` Incorporation of advances in propulsion and guidance technology, along with low-observable -LRB- stealth -RRB- design features, results in a system with improvements in range, accuracy and flexibility.''

<HEAD>Baby Dies as Mom Wins Custody Battle With State</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A mother who fought the state so she could bring her terminally ill 3-year-old daughter home to die learned of her victory in the custody battle just five minutes before the girl died in a hospital. `` It was a very hollow victory,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahdert </PERSON>, an attorney who helped <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> win back little <PERSON> Candice </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> fought for eight months to regain custody of her daughter. A judge in <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION> signed the order Monday and Ms. <PERSON> Rahdert </PERSON> rushed it to the child's room at All Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, about 25 miles away. The mother read the order aloud. The hospital began preparations to discharge the baby. Five minutes later, <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> died. `` It was almost like she was waiting for me to hand that order to her parents,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rahdert </PERSON> said. `` I know that sounds strange, but that was what it was lie.'' <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> suffered health problems from birth, caused by a loss of amniotic fluid during her mother's pregnancy. Doctors had recommended abortion because the baby might not live. Complications kept her in the hospital for two months. She lost her right leg at the knee because of circulation problems and she had failing kidneys. Last March <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> suffered brain damage after a seizure. Doctors said the seizure occurred when Mrs. <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> withheld medication at home. Mrs. <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> said an emergency room doctor told her to withhold the medication. In April the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehablitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> charged Mrs. <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> with child abuse and took the girl away. The child abuse charge was dropped, but the state retained custody until Monday. In September HRS agreed to a compromise: If Mrs. <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> proved she was a fit mother <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> could go home. The mother did what the state asked, but it was n't enough, Ms. <PERSON> Rahdert </PERSON> said. Earlier this month HRS officials asked a judge to add a few more requirements before Mrs. <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> could take <PERSON> Candice </PERSON> home. Then <PERSON> Candice </PERSON>'s condition worsened. On Monday, doctors called Mrs. <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> and said she was likely to die soon. Mrs. <PERSON> Dutchak </PERSON> called her lawyer who sought an emergency custody order. But HRS District Administrator <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> agreed `` for humanitarian reasons'' to release the girl to her mother, according to HRS spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton-Jones </PERSON>. Circuit Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> signed the order transferring custody about 12:45 p.m., the attorney said. `` I dashed from the courthouse ... to the hospital ... <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> read the order out loud stating that they did get custody back,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rahdert </PERSON> said. ` About five minutes after mom read this order out loud to everyone in the room, including the child, the child died.''

 I think we have to continually seek to find better ways to effectively utilize the military. We should not be engaged in the business of perhaps sometimes degrading our military roles and missions in an ineffective interdiction job of drugs. I ca n't claim any expertise in that area now. It's a matter that I will have to get into and get into in some depth once I'm confirmed. Q. There's been some suggestion that the accusations against you have been fueled by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> itself because of its fear and concern about the reforms you would make. Any comments? A. If that's true, I would consider that to be a very, very strong recommendation for my confirmation. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q. Several hundred men and women are ousted each year from the armed aervices because they are homosexuals. How would you _ would you favor the creation of a panel to study whether the military's ban should be ended A. Well my visceral reaction is that it should not be, but it's a matter on which I have n't done _ quite frankly, have not done much thinking nor paid close attention to. I'm sure it is a matter that will come to my early attention and that I will have to deal with it. I am not prepared to do so right now. Q. If confirmed, what effect will all the debate leading up to the vote have on your ability to function as secretary of defense? A. I have been assured by my potential subordinates that it would have no adverse effect on them in terms of following my direction and my authority. I think when people suggest that I would be incapable or crippled or in some way debilitated in the performance of my duty, to explain how they think I would be. I think once you're given that authority, backed up by the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and you're engaged in the active cooperation of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that my effectiveness would not be diminished. And two, there is a very clear perception in the military community that I am being very, very unfairly treated and my confirmation would be considered vindication. And I think to survive the kind of campaign that I have been through actually indicates strength and not weakness. Q. Senator, could you tell us what specific defense or national security programs are being delayed pending your confirmation?

<HEAD>Young West Germans Unworried By Soviet Military Threat, Poll Says</HEAD>

 Nearly 90 percent of young West Germans believe the Soviet bloc is not a military threat and most want their country to cut defense spending, according to a poll released Wednesday. The survey, commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television, appeared to be yet another sign of the positive attitude many Germans are developing toward the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, especially toward Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his promise to withdraw troops from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> said the independent Forschungsgruppe Wahlen research company surveyed 825 West Germans between 16 and 29 years old. The network did not provide a margin of error for the poll, which was conducted from Feb. 17 to Feb. 23. The poll said 87 percent do not feel militarily threatened by the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and 78 percent believe their nation should cut defense spending, which has an annual level of about $ 30 billion. The results of the poll were described during a ZDF program Wednesday night on the armed forces and provided in advance to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Public opinion polls last year repeatedly said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s popularity far outstripped that of then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Many West Germans have come to regard the Cold War as being nearly over, recent polls indicate. In addition, many appear smitten with the `` Gorbymania'' orchestrated by the increasingly image-conscious Kremlin. They also responded positively to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pledge earlier this year to unilaterally cut armed forces by 500,000 troops in two years, including a reduction of 240,000 soldiers in the European theater. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said the production of arms and military supplies would be slashed by 19.5 percent and 10,000 tanks would be eliminated in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The perception that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat is diminishing has led to growing questions about the need for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military training flights in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the routine maneuvers that chew up farmers' fields and disrupt daily life A key issue for the federal government in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> is whether to replace the approximately 600 aging Lance nuclear missiles stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s government wants the decision delayed until 1991 or 1992, to keep it from becoming an issue in next year's general elections

 A woman who allegedly left her 4-year-old son in the care of two homeless men in the city bus terminal has a long history of scrapes with the law, police and relatives say. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON>, 23, was arrested Tuesday when she reported her son missing 26 hours after she let two strangers take care of the boy while she allegedly took drugs and worked as a prostitute. The boy, who had been found by police at the bus terminal, was placed in city custody, and Ms. <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON> was arrested on a charge of endangering the welfare of a child, a misdemeanor. `` She said she wanted to see her baby,'' said <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Poggioli </PERSON>. `` When we told her she was being arrested, she was shocked. Then the tears came.'' There was less shock in <LOCATION> Brattleboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, where a relative said Ms. <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON> had grown up beset by problems _ difficult family relations, drugs and drinking, young motherhood, a couple of minor scrapes with the law. `` She had petty larceny here. Alcohol is her biggest problem, and drugs. She got into drugs quite a bit,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON>, the woman's uncle. `` It started way back when she was a kid; her father used to drink considerable. She and her mother did n't get along. Just one of those bad scenes.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Brattleboro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, `` We know who she is,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowell </PERSON>. A warrant for her arrest has been pending since she failed to appear at a court hearing Dec. 27 on a shoplifting charge. The charge is a minor one: Stealing two marble bookends and three boxes of candles Nov. 12 from a stationery store in <LOCATION> Brattleboro </LOCATION>, a misdemeanor punishable by up to six months in jail and a $ 300 fine. <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> records list a few earlier cases: a $ 15 fine for shoplifting in 1982, probation for a burglary in 1983 and a $ 25 fine in 1983 for carrying an open beer. The father of Ms. <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON>'s child has been in bigger trouble: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is in state prison in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> for a burglary conviction, authorities said. <PERSON> Poggioli </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON> once went through a drug rehabilitation program. Her father, <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday night, told reporters: `` She needs drugs.'' She allegedly came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with her son, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, to flee the arrest warrant, staying in cheap hotels. On Monday, Officer <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Frain </PERSON> saw the boy with two men in a restricted area of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. They told him they were baby-sitting while his mother worked as a prostitute, police said. The men did not know the woman's name or the boy's. Police arrested them on trespassing charges. When Ms. <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON> appeared Tuesday at the police station to report her son missing, she said she looked for her child all night, said <PERSON> Poggioli </PERSON>. `` But she was n't looking too hard. We have people on the street who say they saw her doing crack,'' he said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McKelvey </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> district attorney, said Ms. <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON>'s arraignment was not scheduled as of Wednesday afternoon. <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedberg </PERSON>, a lawyer with the city's welfare office, said a hearing also had not been set on the <PERSON> Longueil </PERSON> family's request to gain custody of the child

 Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> took his place at the helm of the largest federal department Wednesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved his nomination 98-1. One senator called the new health and human services secretary a `` compassionate professional.'' The lone vote against <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> was cast by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, who criticized the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> doctor for declining to take a position on several abortion-related issues, including research on fetal tissue. In other confirmation action Wednesday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 99-0 to approve retired Adm. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, as the first career military man to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, which devotes two-thirds of its budget to developing, building and testing the nation's nuclear arsenal at a network of 15 major plants in a dozen states <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, 61, who retired in 1986 after 41 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, encountered no opposition during the confirmation process and was widely praised on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as a fit choice for guiding the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at a time of growing controversy over the condition of its nuclear weapons complex. _ <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, nominated to head the new <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, told his confirmation hearing he still does n't believe he endangered anyone 12 years ago with an unthinking warning to the Korean embassy that one of their agents was about to defect to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> In initial questioning by the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, no senator criticized his action in the Korean matter, but Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., said, `` I do not intend to take a position until the vote tomorrow. _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, nominated to lead the fight against drug abuse, told his confirmation hearing that a well-fashioned strategy can ease the problem but that it `` will not disappear overnight. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> appeared a virtual shoo-in for endorsement by the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, with his sharpest critic, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., saying he was considering voting against the nomination but that he had n't made up his mind <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a 55-year-old blood specialist, was roundly praised by Democrats and Republicans alike for his commitment to the health-care needs of the poor, demonstrated by his founding of the <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to train physicians to work in medically underserved areas. `` I'm confident that Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is going to be a caring advocate for these millions of Americans,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, said the task of administering a department with a nearly $ 400 billion budget and 114,000 employees `` must fall on the shoulders of a compassionate professional. I believe that Dr. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> is such a person.'' The issue of abortion has been the most controversial for <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> since his remarks in the Atlanta Journal Constitution that he supported abortion and to Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., that he favored retaining the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision legalizing the procedure At his confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> apologized to <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> for having `` misspoken'' his position and said he holds the same views on the subject as the president: He is opposed to abortion except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life; he opposes federal financing of abortions except when the mother's life is threatened, and he favors reversal of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>. <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, who is strongly pro-choice, said he disagreed with <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s stand on abortion, but he said the issue has gotten undue attention considering that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> has few abortion-related activities. `` In every sense this man is qualified to do a first rate job. The issue of abortion ought to be irrelevant,'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said. Several senators said that while they admired <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s attempt to avoid any conflicts of interest by forfeiting nearly $ 300,000 in severance pay from his job as president of <ORGANIZATION> Morehouse </ORGANIZATION>, the sacrifice was n't necessary and could discourage others from taking government jobs.

<HEAD>Expanded Methadone Program Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two federal agencies on Wednesday proposed to help fight AIDS among heroin addicts by allowing interim methadone treatment in cities where comprehensive treatment programs have waiting lists. The plan, to be published in Thursday's Federal Register, was proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> to make methadone treatments available to more addicts sooner and reduce exposure to AIDS through needle-sharing. Also Thursday, final rules will go into effect to streamline regulations governing methadone treatment programs and make other changes, including elimination of the counselor-patient ratio at treatment clinics. Previously programs had to have one counselor for every 50 patients. Intravenous heroin addicts often share needles and, in doing so, become infected with the virus that causes the deadly disease. Methadone, which is used to help relieve an addict's craving for heroin, is taken by mouth, which eliminates the risk from needles. Although methadone is best used as part of a comprehensive treatment program that includes counseling and other vocational and rehabilitative services, many clinics have waiting lists of six months or more, the agencies said. About 500,000 of the estimated 1.2 million intravenous drug abusers in the country are heroin addicts, and three out of four cities with methadone treatment clinics have waiting lists, the institute said. Under the proposal, heroin addicts would be able to receive methadone treatment seven days a week at out-patient clinics and from mobile medical units, but the drug would not be provided for take-home use. Participants would be counseled on avoiding acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The proposal is based on a pilot program at <ORGANIZATION> Beth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which `` appears to have reduced the use of needles,'' the two agencies said.

<HEAD>WASHN: your confirmation?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 A. I do n't know of any that are being delayed. We're in the process now of trying to come up with the revised budget based on the budgetary constraints of a zero budget for fiscal year 1990. And that's ongoing right now and the numbers crunchers are hard at work. Q. It appears that the Soviets must reduce their huge military expenditures if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika is to succeed. In that event, is this any time for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to make unilateral reductions in defense expenditures? A. I think unilateral reductions would be dangerous in the extreme. We must not. We must continue to modernize and improve our forces. We can not engage in a euphemistic orgy of neglect of our defense establishments throughout <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The fact is, if perestroika succeeds, what will emerge will be a much stronger <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. That omens well for the future if it is a more benign <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, one that is not so bent on self-aggrandizement; a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> that is prepared to live in peace and harmony with its neighbors. That will be, of course, a very happy outcome. And then, perhaps, we can begin the business of beating swords into plowshares and spears into pruning hooks. But it is altogether possible that what could emerge from a successful reform effort that strengthens the Soviet economy would be a further emboldened <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, ever more threatening and ever more ominous. We must be prepared for either outcome. Q. In the event that you do not win confirmation, will you return to consulting for defense contractors? A. I have no intention of ever returning to defense consulting again in any circumstance. Following my career in government service, should it extend over a period of a few years from now, or should it extend over a much shorter period of time, it is my expectation that my involvement in national security matters will be in the academic world primarily, my involvement in defense matters. In all probability, if _ once I _ well, I wo n't say in probability, I'd say it's a virtual certainty that once I complete my public service _ I've spent virtually all of my adult life in public service, only two, a little over two years, two and a half years in the private sector and that's all, the rest of it has been given over to public service. I've accumulated very little in this world, being a school teacher by background _ or by trade, and a clergyman's son by background. And I remember what <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nance </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> once said when he left the vice presidency after having served as speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a distinguished career, he said he was going to cross that <LOCATION> Potomac </LOCATION> heading west and never return again. He never came back, and he lived to be 95 years old. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- However, I will not make that kind of flat commitment. It is my plan to load up my 1972 Dodge Charger 400 Magnum with all my possessions, mattress strapped to the roof, and all that sort of thing, and head back to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> to _ as my permanent residence. But, I might be back from time to time in one capacity or another. Incidentally, in that my grandparents lived into their 90s, my enemies can take small comfort that I will depart this world anytime soon. -LRB- Laughter. -RRB- Q. Representative <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>'s plan to fund all strategic programs at $ 31 billion over a 10-year period has been proposed. Is this the type of proposal that ought to be coming from a secretary of defense?

 Firefighters nationwide need a better system for notifying them of hazardous materials so they can prevent accidents such as the one that killed six <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mo </PERSON>. firemen last year, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel was told Wednesday. `` They had no warning that the fire they were trying to extinguish was a time bomb waiting to take their lives,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firefighters </ORGANIZATION>. At a hearing before a House Government Operations subcommittee, <PERSON> Conroy </PERSON>, other firefighting officials and several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said that accident pointed to the need for tighter and more coordinated regulation of hazardous materials as well as improved training for firemen. The <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> firefighters were killed when a trailer loaded with tons of blasting agent exploded at a highway construction site Nov. 29. Lawmakers were told that a dispatcher warned the firefighters that explosives might be in the area but was unable to provide the specific location or the type of hazardous material involved. Most of the criticism was directed at the regulatory system spread among a host of federal agencies as well as state and local governments. Current laws have created `` tremendous duplication and confusion and, at the same time, leave gaping voids,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Eversole </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> fire department's hazardous incident team. Lawmakers were told that current `` right-to-know'' laws were inadequate and that many companies do not comply with requirements to report chemicals and other hazardous materials to fire departments and other emergency planning agencies. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the employment and housing subcommittee, suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> consider criminal penalties for those failing to report hazardous materials Rep. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, D-Mo., complained that the blasting agent in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> accident was not on an <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> list of materials that must be reported to firefighters <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Makris </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official, said the agency would consider adding it to the reporting requirement.

<HEAD>Witness Says North ``Assumed Worst'' on Congressional Limits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A retired general testified at <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial Wednesday that he and <PERSON> North </PERSON> decided in 1985 `` to assume the worst'' _ that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s actions were covered by a law forbidding official aid to the Nicaraguan Contras _ and to act accordingly Earlier in the day, however, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> testified that he made many trips between <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, carrying instructions from the presidential aide for how the guerrilla war was to be fought, and carrying maps and money. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said <PERSON> North </PERSON> told him he acted with the knowledge and approval of superiors. The courier testified at one point that <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he had President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approval, but he said later that testimony was wrong, that <PERSON> North </PERSON> never got more specific than `` superiors.'' Retired Maj. Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, an ardent anti-communist who directed spy activities in three wars, also testified he persuaded <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and another <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> nation _ with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s knowledge _ to give $ 5 million each to the Nicaraguan Contras but the plan failed for lack of a required signal from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. At the time, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was under a Congress-imposed ban, the Boland Amendment, against helping the rebels conducting a guerrilla war against the Nicaraguan government. The second Asian country was not identified. <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said he proposed to North in December 1984 to solicit funds in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>'s `` close personal friends at high levels sympathetic to the cause.'' `` I explained that the policy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was quite clear, to support the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> resistance, and that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' temporary action stopped us,'' he testified <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, who will return to the witness stand Thursday, was the fourth witness in the trial which resumed despite serious, still-unresolved, national security issues that had halted testimony for nearly two days. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has renewed a motion to declare that a federal law designed to protect state secrets from being spilled in the courtroom is unconstitutional as applied to the North case. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> also has asked that the 12 criminal charges against North be thrown out. On Wednesday, the government replied that the process of handling classified material in court `` is not, as <PERSON> North </PERSON> contends, a reason to conclude that the trial is unworkable.'' While North's trial continues, one of the key figures who will testify for the prosecution, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, is to be sentenced Friday by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. He pleaded guilty a year ago to four misdemeanors involving withholding information from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities North is accused of lying to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about his activities on behalf of the Nicaraguan Contras _ activities in which both he and <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> were deeply involved _ in the 1984-1986 period when the Boland Amendment banned such aid. `` I argued that it could not possibly apply to the office of the president,'' <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said. North, then a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, was assigned to the president's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> said he agreed, but could not get consensus _ some said it did apply some said it did not,'' <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said. They agreed that `` the best thing was to assume the worst: that it did apply.'' <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said they worked out an arrangement under which he would work with rebel leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> and keep <PERSON> North </PERSON> informed. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, at one point in his testimony, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> told him that everything he was doing was with the president's knowledge. But he later said he `` misspoke'' and that North only referred to orders from superiors. `` Colonel <PERSON> North </PERSON> never said anything about the president's knowledge,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said under questioning by assistant prosecutor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Zornow </PERSON> Q. Did he ever tell you the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> told him to lie? A. No sir. Q. Did he ever tell you the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> told him to conceal what he was doing. A. No sir. Further, said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> never invoked the names of the national security advisers he worked under, <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense is that he had authorization from superiors for everything he did. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> also said he met with at least half a dozen <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents in Central American countries to discuss supply efforts to the Contras. The agents were referred to in the courtroom by number. <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON>, testifying about his efforts to get foreign funds, said he was going to try a second time to get the Asian money for the Contras, got assurance from then-Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> that a signal would be given, then was telephoned by <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and told to call off the effort. <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> also testified that in March 1985 he went to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and met with Nicaraguan rebel leaders and base commanders, and returned to give <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> a priority list of items that Contra commander <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> suggested. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> put $ 5 million into an account in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the weapons were bought and arrived in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by ship in 1985, <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said. In August 1986, days before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had a face-to-face meeting with <PERSON> North </PERSON> to ask about his activities, <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said, he offered a new list of weapons' prices to <PERSON> North </PERSON> who told him he was `` no longer in the business'' and to send them to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singlaub </PERSON> said he wrote to <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, his World War II boss in the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> _ the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s forerunner _ and said the list `` was developed in conjunction with a member of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> who is knowledgeable of the urgent need'' of the Contras Later he saw <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> `` who threatened to throw me out of his office if I discussed the subject of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in his presence. I told him I would keep North informed. ... He indicated that was the proper place.''

 An anonymous telephone caller Wednesday said a kidnapped <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier would be freed if authorities released <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> prisoners and compensate victims of the Arab uprising, a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> lawyer said. The soldier, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportas </PERSON>, 21, has been missing since Feb. 16 when he disappeared en route from the army to his home in the coastal city of <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>. He was dressed in his olive green army uniform and armed with an M-16 at the time of his disappearance, media reports have said. The call to <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahmeh </PERSON>, a pro-PLO lawyer from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, was the second reported Wednesday. An earlier anonymous call was received by the <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presse </ORGANIZATION> news bureau in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, AFP reporters said. Both callers promised that a videotape of Sassportas would be released, but none was reported found. It could not be determined if the calls were made by the same person. Police coordinating the search for the missing paratrooper declined to comment. According to <PERSON> Rahmeh </PERSON>, the caller said his group, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, would release the soldier if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> agreed to a series of demands. The demands included release of Palestinians apprehended before and during the uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands, and compensation for families who had lost children or whose homes had been demolished as punishment, <PERSON> Rahmeh </PERSON> said. He said the caller also demanded that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> broadcast film the caller contended exists on the March 1988 assassination of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, also known by his nom de guerre, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>, was the No. 2 man in <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. There have been allegations that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was responsible for the assassination, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> never has publicly admitted involvement. The call to <PERSON> Rahmeh </PERSON> was the fifth known to have been made in the Sassportas case. Last week, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, the Democratic Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, the army said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio on Tuesday received a call from a man who said the soldier would be released if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> freed 1,500 Palestinian prisoners. Wednesday's call to <ORGANIZATION> AFP </ORGANIZATION> was the second this week. AFP journalist <PERSON> Jean-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Porte </PERSON> said the caller was the same man who telephoned the agency on Monday to claim the abduction of the soldier on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The group was not publicly known before the call, but <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> army commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said it has been operating since the start of the 14-month Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The caller told AFP that a nine-minute videotape of the kidnapped <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> was delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but spokesmen for the major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies here said they had no information about such a tape.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday approved $ 416 million for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mission that will oversee <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s passage to freedom after 74 years of South African rule. `` The show is on the road,'' declared <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, the ndersecretary-general in charge of all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operations. The one-year <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence begins April 1. The 159-member assembly adopted by consensus a funding resolution for a <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> force that will consist of 4,650 peacekeepers, 500 police, and about 2,200 civilian staff and election monitors. The mission will oversee elections for a constituent assembly in November that will organize a black majority-ruled government _ creating the world's newest independent nation and in the process settling the last major colonial problem in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials confirmed publicly that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will receive a generous share of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> funds as the force makes purchases in the region, including $ 10.2 million in gasoline and aviation fuel. Some black African nations, led by <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, fought to make the world body heed its own calls for trade embargoes on South African products. `` We do n't have any oil distribution in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, so we have to use the oil that is there,'' said <PERSON> Martti </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahtisaari </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary-general in charge of the civilian phase of the <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> transition plan. `` For the military component, the maximum tasks come in the first few weeks of the transition period,'' said <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>. He said the military `` has to ensure that the South African forces are confined to barracks; ... to start supervising the withdrawal of South African forces down to 1,500; ... to start the process of dismantling the command structures and taking into custody the arms of the various local forces that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has set up in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.'' White-dominated <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> since it captured the colony from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War I. In December, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed accords with <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreeing to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> if 50,000 Cuban troops stationed in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> are sent home by mid-1991. Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> adjoins <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is one of the world's most sparsely populated areas, with an estimated 1.3 million people occupying territory as large as <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> combined. The Ovambo people inhabit the relatively fertile northern region and make up about half the population. There are 75,000 white residents. The economy is dominated by mining, with diamonds, uranium and copper the principal minerals.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Amount of Aflatoxin in Food Supply Unlikely to Hurt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said Wednesday that cancer-causing aflatoxin is unlikely to get into the food supply in amounts great enough to hurt anyone. `` Anytime we have a drought, we are going to see more aflatoxin problems,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on rural development, agriculture and related agencies. `` That does n't mean we're going to have more in the food supply ... or any that slips in is going to hurt anyone. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> criticized a recent article in The Wall Street Journal that said aflatoxin-tainted corn is moving through the nation's food chain because of inadequate sampling and unreliable testing. He said the article implied that people are being cavalier about the existence of the toxin. `` Everyone is going to do their best to minimize the risk of letting aflatoxin into the food supply,'' he said. `` Nobody in the food chain wants it.'' Last year's heat and drought were ideal for development of the fungus that produces aflatoxin, which researchers have linked to the development of liver cancer in laboratory rats. The level of aflatoxin allowed in corn is 20 parts per billion. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said about 6 percent _ 95 samples out of 1,650 _ of the field corn tested in recent months had higher levels. That corn can not be used for human consumption, but can be diverted to feed non-dairy cattle, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> tested about 263 samples of corn flour and corn meal and found 2 percent, or six samples, to have more than 20 parts of aflatoxin per billion. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> policy requires that these products be removed from the market. In answer to another question from the subcommittee, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he considers the chance of international trade reform to be better than it has been in a decade. He said that there are some hurdles the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> must work out before talks in the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round resume next month in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. `` I'm cautiously optimistic we'll get that worked out between now and April,'' he told the committee. `` What happens in the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round will determine what we should have in farm legislation,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. He said he does n't anticipate any significant changes from the 1985 farm bill that is due to expire in 1990. He said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> could extend the 1985 law until the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> talks are complete, or pass a new bill and amend it as necessary after the negotiations.

<HEAD>Peru Rekindles Austerity Plan As Inflation Continues Surge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Wednesday installed the second in a series of four monthly austerity measures aimed at reducing record inflation by cutting subsidies on basic foods and transportation. Consumer prices rose 42.5 percent in February, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday, despite the austerity plan launched Feb. 1. The measures Wednesday included a devaluation of 23.3 percent, bringing the value of the official Peruvian currency, the inti, from 920 to 1,200 to the dollar. In addition, the prices of products subsidized by the government were increased. Consumer prices for basic foods, such as wheat, cooking oil and milk, were increased between 33 percent and 50 percent, and gasoline was increased 28 percent, according to the government. The minimum monthly wage rose from 42,000 intis to 55,000, equivalent to $ 46 at the official rate, and salaries for all state employees and non-unionized private workers rose a similar percentage. Analysts say <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s working class and poor have been hit hardest by rocketing inflation, which ran a record 1,722 percent last year as a result of subsidy-fueled deficit spending under President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, and a dramatic shrinkage of the economy last year estimated at 8.4 percent. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s subsidy-cutting plan that raised prices on gasoline prices and bus tickets this week set off widespread rioting that left at least 100 dead. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s administration has acknowledged inflation will continue to grow in the short term due to the price and wage increases but eventually decline with a decrease in government spending for subsidies. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said inflation so far this year has reached 109.9 percent. Consumer prices rose 47.3 percent in January. Prior to the program of austerity installments, which concludes in May, the government over the past year has been steadily cutting back on the types of products its subsidizes. Now most imported products now must be purchased at the floating free market exchange rate, which was 1,300 intis to the dollar and unchanged by Wednesday's measures.

<HEAD>Quayle Meets Guatemalan President</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Guatemalan President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>, meeting Wednesday with Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, said leftist-ruled <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> should start democratic reforms before a final agreement to disband the Contra rebels. <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> told reporters after his half-hour session with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials `` still have reservations'' about the peace agreement reached two weeks ago by the five Central American presidents. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>'s session with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and a similar meeting scheduled Thursday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered an opportunity to voice <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns about <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s intentions in the agreement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. A chief complaint expressed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials is lack of an enforcement mechanism to ensure the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> live up to promised reforms. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> emphasized that concern Wednesday, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to make the same point, administration officials said. Previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy held that the U.S.-backed Contras provided the goad which could push the Sandinistas into democratization. One major roadblock to a Nicaraguan peace plan has been an inability to agree on whether disarmament of the Contras of internal reforms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> should come first. Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> pledged in the agreement last month to free political prisoners, hold early elections, allow opposition parties access to the media and repatriate the Contras. But there was no timetable for those reforms and the five presidents said they would agree on those details within 90 days. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, asked Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> should implement reforms, said, `` They have to make the things before and at the same time when we affirm the plans for the contras demobilization.'' <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> said he assured <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> the Contras would disarm `` in an orderly manner.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> encouraged continued meetings between the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents and with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representatives to further the peace process, said an administration official who declined to be identified. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> need help from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to rebuild their economy after almost a decade of internal war and they know that assistance only will be offered if there is peace throughout <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The vice president also brought up Guatemalan human rights with <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, but the official offered no details. Administration officials wanted to discuss <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns over continuing human rights abuses in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they are convinced human rights violations are not a matter of government policy but that those guilty of politically-motivated crimes must be brought to justice. Americas Watch, a private rights group, has said <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s record on the rights issue is far worse than the administration is willing to concede <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON>, the executive director of <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Watch </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last month that <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> `` continues to have one of the worst human rights records in the Western Hemisphere'' despite more than three years of civilian government. <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> said the number of violent abuses in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> rose last year and rural areas continue to live under de facto military dictatorship.

<HEAD>Bush Pitches For Tax Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drew on his recent <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> trip to make a new pitch for lower capital gains taxes Wednesday, claiming western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> businesses enjoy a competitive tax advantage over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. `` The ` four dragons' of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> all exempt long-term capital gains from tax, total exemption. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also had no tax on capital gains during its meteoric rise to economic power,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a business group at the White House. In his 1989 budget, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed that the tax on capital gains be lowered to a maximum of 15 percent from its current rate of 28 percent or, in some cases, 33 percent. `` While I was in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, this recent trip, I had a chance to think seriously about what sets our trading partners apart from us, and I realized that we may have erected a barrier to our own success and deprived ourselves of vital long-term investment that our competitors have always enjoyed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He returned Monday from a five-day trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Speaking to about 250 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` By taxing capital gains, we impede our own progress and we turn the playing field into an uphill climb.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claims that lowering the tax on capital gains _ profits from the sale of stock, real estate, works of art or other assets _ will spur business investment, reaping for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> more than it costs. However, the idea has generated fierce opposition in the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where leaders have sought to portray it as a new tax break for the rich. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday insisted the tax break will increase revenues $ 4.8 billion annually. Private economists are divided on whether lowering capital gains taxes would increase or decrease revenues. While in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cautioned the South Korean National Assembly to do more in opening markets and avoiding protectionism. He made reference to that in Wednesday's address, claiming he had stressed to Asian trading partners `` at every stop ... the need for keeping these markets open.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that the international war on illegal drugs `` is clearly not being won'' and might even be `` slipping backwards.'' The assessment was in the annual presidential report on global drug trafficking, which <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> sent to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. The wide-ranging report, which singled out the new government in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for some praise, listed 17 countries or territories as major illegal drug producers or transit points, yet found their governments to be helping in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug battle. The president's action, known formally as `` certification,'' means those nations will not lose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military or economic aid or become ineligible for loans and other trade preferences. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recommended that <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> be added to the list of nations ineligible for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid because of their support for drug trafficking. That step, however, is virtually meaningless since neither nation, or the others in the same list _ <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ receives any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. The action, however, does permit the government to impose tariffs or tighten custom rules against certain imports. The study is expected to spark controversy on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> because of its treatment of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and several other nations known to be major drug exporters or transit points. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 63-27 to punish <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for its lack of cooperation in the battle against drugs, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> killed a similar measure. This year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has 45 days to decide whether it agrees with the president's findings. The most striking language came in the dim view taken by <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of the international battle against illicit drugs. The secretary said he and the president `` are both deeply troubled by the state of affairs. ... Both here and abroad, the international war on narcotics is clearly not being won. In fact, in some areas, we appear to be slipping backwards.'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics matters, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s grim assessment was based on the worldwide increases in marijuana, opium and coca production, as well as a worldwide increase in drug abuse. `` These twin increases fuel ... an increase in power of drug trafficking cartels _ and that worries us,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Wrobleski </PERSON>, who discussed the report with journalists. In his letter accompanying the report, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> pledged that the battle against illegal drugs will `` remain a key element of our foreign policy agenda'' and that both he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will `` raise this issue with foreign leaders'' in the effort to reduce the supply of drugs bound for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Under law, the president is required to certify by March 1 that countries where major drug trafficking occurs are `` fully cooperating'' with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to stem the drug trade. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> noted that of the 17 countries found to be cooperating with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, six `` can and must do more in the future to end the drug trade.'' The include: _ The <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, which was praised for a combined law enforcement operation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but was cited for possible government corruption and urged to make `` stronger unilateral efforts to curb drug trafficking and consumption. _ <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, which was lauded for a `` good effort'' with its coca eradication program The administration expressed concern, however, that more must be done. _ <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, which was praised for `` strong action'' against cocaine refining and resistance to violent drug traffickers It was noted, however, that the `` judiciary remains intimidated'' by the drug traffickers and little prospect for their arrest exists. _ <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which was cited for President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' `` strong public stance'' against drugs, as well as the efforts of his new deputy attorney general But corruption was seen as a continuing problem, and the nation remains the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' top source for heroin and its No. 2 source for marijuana. _ <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>, which was praised for a `` stronger commitment'' in 1988, but was still termed a `` significant drug transit point and money-laundering center. Former Gen. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> was ousted by a military coup in February. Although reports have surfaced that the new president, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, has links to the drug-trafficking industry, the list says the department does `` not yet know'' what type of actions will be taken by his government. _ <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, which was lauded for `` some real progress in anti-drug programs,'' but was urged to adopt an even stronger crop control effort

<HEAD>Governors Urge Bush to Act on Acid Rain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A group of governors and former governors urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminstration Wednesday to propose acid rain legislation that would reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by at least 10 million tons by the end of this century. Such emission reductions are needed for the legislation `` to be taken serously in the acid rain debate,'' Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, one of the meeting participants, told a news conference. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> is the new chairman of the Alliance for Acid Rain Control, a coalition of governors, industry representatives and environmentalists working toward reducing acid rain, which is caused largely by industrial pollution and emissions from coal-burning power plants. But <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, said the meeting with <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, produced no firm commitment from <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> on specific pollution reductions the administration might seek. Nevertheless, said <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON>, `` we are optimistic that this is the year for acid rain legislation'' and an end to `` years of acrimony and deadlock on this issue.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said that one of his top environmental priorities is to submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> legislation aimed at reducing the industrial and other pollutants that cause acid rain. Congressional leaders have said they expect to vote on an acid rain bill by summer. But some of the governors expressed concern that federal legislation might punish states that already have taken aggressive action or producers of western, low-sulphur coal. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, who also participated in the meeting, said that federal legislastion should include `` flexibility'' for different states to meet the emission reductions. For example, the governors said, the coalition opposed a federal requirement for utilities to install expensive `` scrubbers'' to reduce sulphur emissions or for the federal government to provide subsidies for the installation of such scrubbers. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said the group told <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> that requiring scrubbers `` will double the cost of cleanup, ... weaken political support in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and increase global warming problems'' because of increased carbon dioxide emissions. The governor declined to provide specific provisions they would want to see in federal acid rain legislation except to say that it should require specific emission-reduction requirements. Whatever acid rain legislation emerges from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, its provisions must be strictly enforced, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said the group told <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. `` If utilities do n't reduce their pollution as the law requires, they should pay stiff taxes based on the amount of pollution they are releasing into the air. We need to make the punishment fit the crime,'' he added. Among those who met with <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> were <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and now an executive at <ORGANIZATION> W.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Helme </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>; and former <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Two Candidates Runnning For Most Parliament Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An average of two candidates will be running for each seat when Soviets cast ballots for a new parliament on March 26, an election official said Wednesday. Some voting districts will still only have one candidate, but others will have three or four, said <PERSON> Dmitry </PERSON> <PERSON> Golovko </PERSON>, deputy director of the central electoral commission. The new parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, will have 2,250 members and will elect a Supreme Soviet from within its ranks to act as a full-time, two-house legislative body. `` Two candidates will compete for one seat in nearly 1,000 constituencies, and more than 200 have registered three or more candidates,'' <PERSON> Golovko </PERSON> said. The complex process of nominating candidates from 1,500 regional election districts began in December and ended on Feb. 23 with the registration of candidates with the central electoral commission. Candidates put forward by official organizations, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and large trade unions, were registered on Jan. 29 for the 750 seats allocated to them under the new election laws. <PERSON> Golovko </PERSON> said 80 percent of the candidates belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a percentage higher than in previous elections; 20 percent were women and nearly 40 percent were workers or farmers. `` The Soviet people are playing an active part in this campaign and have sent more than 7,000 letters and suggestions to the central electoral commission over the past three months,'' <PERSON> Golovko </PERSON> said. He said many letters suggested improvements in the new election law, which has confused many voters. <PERSON> Golovko </PERSON> admitted the law had `` some imprecisions'' that need clarification. `` The commission will analyze the current election campaign and submit suggestions to the Soviet parliament to improve the Soviet electoral law,'' he said. If a candidate fails to win a 51 percent majority, a new election will be held in that district within two weeks of the March 26 election, <PERSON> Golovko </PERSON> said.

 Police said Wednesday they are hunting for a couple who allegedly lured their victims to hotel rooms, slipped sleep-inducing drugs into their drinks and robbed them. A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said investigators identified the suspects as <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abudl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawa </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Eilien </PERSON> <PERSON> Konga </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> and other nationally circulated Japanese newspapers said the equivalent of about $ 78,000 has been stolen in 26 `` dead sleep'' robberies. The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said that in one case, a 58-year-old businessman invited <PERSON> Konga </PERSON> into his hotel room in July 1987, only to have his beer drugged and about $ 30,000 stolen from his wallet.

<HEAD>Oil Slick In Antarctica Grows, Weather Hampers Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUNTA ARENAS, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An oil slick in <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> caused by a Peruvian scientific ship that ran aground has grown to more than a half-mile long, and rough weather has hampered cleanup efforts, the navy reported Wednesday. It was the first indication that the slick from the Sunday accident, the second in a month in the region, is more serious than originally thought. In another report earlier Wednesday, the navy called the oil spill `` minor.'' Winds reaching up to 80 miles per hour prevented efforts to right the 1,980-ton Humbolt and clean up the slick of diesel oil leaking from two of the ship's fuel tanks, the navy said in a communique. Frogmen from the nearby Uruguayan and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> stations finally succeeded Wednesday in checking the vessel's hull after stormy weather prevented them from doing so for two days. The communique did not describe the extent of the damage, but a <ORGANIZATION> navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arenas </LOCATION>, 1,500 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, said the damage does not seem to be serious. The spokesman, Lt. <PERSON> Cristian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbone </PERSON>, said authorities are confident they will be able to float the Humboldt soon. The navy communique said a Chilean air force helicopter flew over the Humboldt on Wednesday and its crew reported that the slick expanded to more than a half-mile long and 150 feet wide. On Monday the Chilean navy reported the slick to be 450 feet long and 15 feet wide. The navy had also said earlier that stormy weather in the area has prevented the beginning of a clean-up operation. The Humboldt ran aground around midnight Sunday at the entrance of <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Cove </PERSON>, on King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON>. All 64 scientists and sailors aboard were rescued unharmed by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s ice patrol ship Endurance. On Wednesday, however, a group of sailors were back on the ship to start preparing the operation to float it, according to the navy communique. A cutter from the Chilean navy, the <PERSON> Yelcho </PERSON>, was scheduled to reach the Humboldt at dawn Thursday, carrying personnel and equipment both for the floating operation and cleanup. On Jan. 28, a ship from the Argentine navy, the <ORGANIZATION> Bahia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paraiso </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Paradise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, ran aground 300 miles from the site of the Humboldt accident, creating a major oil slick. The slick was eventually cleaned up in an international operation that involved ships and personnel from <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should convene a conference on homelessness because a coherent national strategy to deal with the problem is urgently needed, said Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, who introduced legislation Wednesday to authorize such a meeting. `` Now is the time for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to show the leadership this issue demands,'' said the <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Democrat. Citing studies predicting 18 million Americans will be homeless by the turn of the century if current policies continue, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said `` a coherent, long-range strategy is urgently needed.'' `` This is n't the only answer, but it is an essential ingredient to the comprehensive, effective policy we need,'' he added. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, an author of the <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> Homeless Assistance Act, said he welcomed recent trips to shelters for the homeless b Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has pledged to provide the $ 682.8 million authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in that legislation. `` The White House conference we are proposing today can provide substantive direction for their good intentions,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>'s proposal for a White House conference would authorize meetings and require a report to include specific recommendations for executive and legislative action on homelessness within six months after the sessions. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, who accompanied <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> at a news conference to announce the proposal, said the conference would be `` welcome news'' to local and state officials who have been providing shelter for the homeless after cuts in the federal housing budget during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> had testified earlier as head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger and Homelessness at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommitteee on housing and community development hearing which focused on the need for permanent affordable housing for low - and moderate-income people <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> told the panel he had proposed a White House conference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` If we are ever to turn around these national figures of growing homelessness, we need national leadership that cares about these festering problems,'' said <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> in a written statement.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> promised senators Wednesday to shun the role of a mere figurehead in the national drug-fighting job to which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nominated him. However, commenting at his confirmation hearing, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> sidestepped questions on a substantive issue _ legislation to ban military-style assault rifles sometimes used by drug pushers. `` Why would you take this job to be a figurehead?'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` The pay is not so good; the hours are horrible and the subject matter is depressing.'' Lawmakers questioned the former secretary of education closely on whether as head of the government's war on drug abuse he would be willing and able to engage in vigorous political infighting with <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretaries who might be protective of their own power and prerogatives. He promised that he would speak out within administration councils. `` I do n't think lack of candor has been my problem,'' the outspoken <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told the hearing, drawing laughter from the audience. The tone was more somber, however, when <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., asked <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> if he would support legislation that would outlaw semiautomatic weapons such as AK-47s and Uzis favored by drug pushers <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also quoted a 1988 memo in which <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> had proposed considering efforts to outlaw `` automatic'' and certain other weapons. The current dispute in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is over semiautomatic weapons. It is still possible for private individuals to own fully automatic weapons but only after meeting an array of difficult-to-fulfill requirements. `` What logical or reasonable way is there for a citizen to own an AK-47?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` That's a good question,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> replied. `` I'm waiting for an answer,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` I'll give you one in six months,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also told lawmakers there can be no quick victory in the war against narcotics. `` It will take more than 180 days to turn the tide around,'' he said. Opening the hearing, the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., said he understood that it would take time to get the job done and that there would be some failures along the way <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> used the full powers of his office to combat drug abuse, `` we will run all the political interference you need,'' but if the effort ran out of steam, `` then you have a critic sitting up here.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> appeared a virtual shoo-in for approval by the panel, with his sharpest critic, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., saying `` I think I might be the only one to vote no. And even he left the door open to voting in support of <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s nomination as director of the Office of National Drug Policy. The office was created under wide-ranging crime legislation approved last fall and requires the director to draw up a national strategy aimed at coordinating the war on drugs. The opening of the hearing entailed little more than opening statements and primarily afforded senators a chance to air their special concerns as well as lap up a sizeable helping of the attention that the drug issue always provides. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, R-Wyo., told the panel that `` everybody likes to mess with it because you get seven-camera -LRB- congressional -RRB- hearings out of it. In two hours of welcoming remarks by about a dozen lawmakers, Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., put in a plug for a $ 10 billion prison-construction idea, saying rehabilitation of crime-prone addicts was important but if they `` become career criminals, you have to throw away the key. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, sponsor of a bill to outlaw sale of military-style assault rifles, warned <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> not to ignore the tie between drug abuse and the use of semiautomatic weapons by criminals. The ceremonial comments dragged on so long that Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, merely inserted his statement in the record, saying, `` Two hours of welcoming remarks are about as stupefying as some drugs.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he remained undecided about whether to support the veteran federal official as drug czar, saying he had once voted with enthusiasm to confirm <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>. `` I was less enthusiastic at the end of your term,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` If we were to elect a national gadfly on the drug issue, you would get my vote very quickly,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` The more troubling question is whether you can be an effective administrator.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said he also was disappointed by <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s performance as secretary of education. `` I want from your office not a blizzard of press releases,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. `` I want a solid job on what is really a massive problem in our society.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s habit of using his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post as a `` bully pulpit'' to crusade for upgrading education might be described `` as the activities of a gadfly, a term which I do n't share, but nonetheless it has importance. He hailed the nominee's `` solid record of accomplishment.

The plane carried 354 people, including 18 crew members. `` I instantly knew that we had a hole in the airplane,'' said <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON>. She said her first reaction was to find oxygen to keep from passing out. Because of the damage, the plane's emergency oxygen system did not activate, investigators said. <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> said she searched desperately for an oxygen bottle, finally finding one and taking `` a few real strong inhalations'' to regain her strength. `` Then I stopped and I collected my thoughts for just a second. I realized that the plane was flying. It was not in an uncontrolled rapid descent.'' Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> flew the crippled jet 100 miles on two of four engines, landing safely at <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> International Airport 25 minutes later. Twenty-seven people were injured, with only two still hospitalized Wednesday. <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> said it was `` truly a miracle that there were not more injuries to people from things flying around in the cabin. There were ice buckets, racks of glasses, cartons of juice and bins of things around.'' The decompression of the plane took only a few seconds, and during that time `` anything that was n't nailed down moved,'' she said. <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> said she inched her way forward and saw `` an incredible amount of structural damage'' and that two or three crew members were helping passengers. `` They were reassuring people. I could see them physically touching arms. I do n't know what they were saying because the noise was so incredible you could n't hear yourself think,'' <PERSON> Sanahan </PERSON> said. She started walking back through the cabin, telling passengers to put on life vests and inflate one chamber. She said she tried using the public address system but it was too noisy for it to be heard, so she found a megaphone. <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> said she instructed the passengers to tighten their seat belts, grab their ankles and `` stay down until you know we're back on earth and we've stopped.'' She said she found three young men and assigned them to help with the evacuation upon landing, instructing them on how to open the emergency exit and deploy the inflatable slide, making them repeat the instructions back to her. She said she told them, `` This is a critical job. They will pile up at the bottom of the slide. They will get badly injured. It is vital that you stay there.'' `` And they did. God bless them. They did,'' <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> said. When the captain announced that the plane was two minutes from the end of the runway, `` people kept unfastening their seat belts and standing up to look out the windows,'' she said. `` I'm sure that they wanted the reassurance. They wanted to see those <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> city lights. `` That's why I'm hoarse. I screamed for two minutes: ` Grab your ankles. Stay down, stay down, stay down,''' <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> said. `` It was the best landing. It was just perfect. It was smooth. It was wonderful,'' she said. Once the plane stopped, <PERSON> Shanhan </PERSON> said she whipped open the door and began ordering the passengers to form double lines and leap onto the slide. <PERSON> Shanahan </PERSON> said she did n't know until she was off the plane that passengers had been lost. It was only then that she saw the size of the hole.

 Representatives of publishers and booksellers met with the attorney general and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director Wednesday and said they are now satisfied with the federal response to threats of violence related to <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s book, `` The Satanic Verses.'' Thirteen publishing and bookselling executives met privately for an hour at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON>. Afterward, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Hearst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I'm satisfied they're fully committed to put whatever resources they can into combating this terrorist threat.'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, whose group represents 250 publishers who put out 75 percent of the nation's books, added that the executives had called for the meeting because `` the response from the government had been slow up to now. There was no immediate response to <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat. It was quite a few days before anybody in the government said anything.'' On Tuesday, bombs exploded in two <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, bookstores and the offices of a weekly newspaper in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Afterward, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to get involved. Justice spokesman <PERSON> Loye </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> has opened a criminal investigation of the three blasts. After the meeting, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said, `` Every resource available will be committed to ensure individuals and organizations in this country will be protected in the exercise of their First Amendment rights.'' He said the group discussed how the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can gather intelligence and how people outside government can help. <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rath </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents owners of 7,000 bookstores, said 100,000 copies of the book will be shipped this weekend and `` only a quarter-inch of plate glass will stand between the booksellers' ideals and what's happening on the streets. He predicted virtually all bookstores will sell the novel. <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the federal response, which he said included setting up a hotline for businesses to report threats. `` Maybe they can see patterns in the threats to help with the intelligence effort,'' <PERSON> Rath </PERSON> said. He said threats numbered in the hundreds now, against people involved in selling the book. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had previously spoken out against <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death threat against <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, who is British.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> accused <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Wednesday of being a leading producer and exporter of the chemicals that are destroying the ozone layer. The charge was made on the eve of a world conference here on ozone problems. The environmental group said it obtained figures distributed only to governments and industries indicating that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last year produced 105,000 tons of chlorofluorocarbon gases and exported 48,146 tons. The compounds, widely used in refrigerator coolants, foam insulation, fast-food packaging and propellants for aerosol spray cans, are destroying the ozone layer _ the fragile atmospheric shield that protects the Earth's surface from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays The compounds also contribute to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat, gradually warming the Earth's surface and contributing to potentially dangerous shifts in global weather patterns. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Wednesday her government plans to require all new refrigerators to use safer solvents and all new cars to take unleaded gasoline by 1990. She spoke in an interview for the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television program `` Nature,'' to be broadcast Thursday. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has invited government ministers, industry leaders and scientists to a three-day conference beginning Sunday to discuss practical steps to reduce the problems. More than 110 countries have accepted. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has vowed to reduce chloroflurocarbon emissions by 85 percent by 1999. An additional 30 countries have ratified the 1987 Montreal Protocol that calls for a 50 percent reduction by then. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> wants the compounds banned immediately. `` Some -LRB- chloroflurocarbons -RRB- have a life of at least 380 years, so each one we produce adds to the potentially lethal legacy we are leaving for 10 generations,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsworth </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said annual world consumption of chloroflurocarbons is estimated to be 1 million to 1.2 million tons. It said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accounted for 73.6 percent of production in 1984, and 70 percent of consumption in 1985. Environment Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday a big demand remains worldwide for chloroflurocarbons and joint international efforts are needed to reduce it. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said no one has ever published a country-by-country list of chloroflurocarbon producers containing precise production figures. Lord <ORGANIZATION> Caithness </ORGANIZATION>, a junior environment minister, confirmed at a briefing on the weekend conference that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is `` one of the largest'' chloroflurocarbon producers, but added, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is more of a bigger producer than us.'' <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said a 1988 report written for the French Ministry of the Environment lists the capacity of chloroflurocarbon plants worldwide and estimated that <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> plants operated at 70 percent capacity on average. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is one of the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> members. By matching capacity with performance, <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said it arrived at its production figures, showing that in 1984, the main producer of chloroflurocarbons was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 455,000 tons or 37.4 percent of world production. It was followed by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with 440,000 tons or 36.2 percent of production; <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with 150,000 tons or 12.4 percent; and communist countries with 120,000 tons or 4.1 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has a production capacity of 150,000 tons, so if it operated last year at the 70 percent average, it would have produced 105,000 tons.

<TEXT>
 Imposing the death penalty on teen-ager <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who admitted stabbing an elderly woman to death, violates the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> constitutions, her lawyers argued Wednesday. `` We do not say that <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> was not responsible for what she did,'' defense attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` What we are saying is that the death sentence in this case violates the 8th Amendment to the Constitution, which protects against cruel and unusual punishment.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> pleaded guilty to murder in 1986 for the killing of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON>, a 78-year-old Bible teacher who was stabbed at least 30 times with a butcher knife on May 14, 1985. Three other teen-agers from <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, went to trial and were convicted of murder in the case. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who was 15 at the time of the crime, was accused of masterminding the robbery and killing Mrs. <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> in her <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> home. She is the youngest female in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be sentenced to death. <PERSON> Touchette </PERSON> argued that <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrough </PERSON> failed to consider <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s abusive family environment as a mitigating circumstance in the crime. If he had, the attorney argued, it would have prohibited him from sentencing her to die in the electric chair. However, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Secrest </PERSON>, a deputy attorney general, said the judge did consider <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s family background, her age and her clean record, but found that it did not weigh heavily enough to save her from the death penalty. `` It's important to remember the brutality of the crime,'' <PERSON> Secrest </PERSON> said. `` It's important to remember that it was pre-planned and pre-meditated.'' At the time of <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s conviction, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> law allowed the execution of anyone over age 10 convicted of murder. That age limit has since been raised to 16, but was not made retroactive. Also attending the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing was a delegation of seven Italians representing the human-rights group `` Thou Shalt Not Kill.'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> has becoome a popular cause in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for opponents of the death penalty. Last June, members of <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> submitted petitions from nearly 2 million Italians who wanted then-Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> to commute her sentence. In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, about 100 protesters marched Wednesday night to the office of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to support <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s appeal. The Rev. <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON>, a spokesman for the delegation that traveled to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, said about 400 of his countrymen were fasting and praying for <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. The Italian delegation planned to visit <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 19, at the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Women's Prison on Thursday before traveling to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` Americans protest and pay money to save the whales, the eagles, the wolves and other creatures,'' <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Why do n't you think it's worth it to rehabilitate a human being?'' Also speaking at the news conference was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON>, 41, who introduced himself as a `` grandson of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> and friend of <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> said he has written letters to <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> and believes she is remorseful for her crime. `` I have a deep love and compassion for <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> said. `` My grandmother was a Christian woman, and it was through her that I learned love, prayer and forgiveness. I know that revenge is not the answer.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices did not say how long it would take them to reach a decision on the appeal.

<HEAD>New South African Law Will Allow Some Integrated Neighborhoods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After 39 years of mandatory residential segregation, a new law took effect Wednesday that will allow a few carefully selected multiracial neighborhoods. In a separate development, the government announced it has commuted the death sentences of 16 prisoners, including an activist who was the subject of clemency appeals from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The government also agreed to release 50 detainees held without charge, anti-apartheid church leaders said Wednesday following a meeting with the Minister of Law and Order <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>. The churchmen said that will bring to 279 the number of releases <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> has authorized in the past two weeks. The government has hailed the legalization of integrated neighborhoods as a milestone, but an opposition newspaper called it a `` half-baked'' plan that will create a few overcrowded multiracial areas while segregation prevails elsewhere. Most observers expect that multiracial neighborhoods will be limited to a handful of new housing developments and to inner-city neighborhoods that already have become integrated despite segregation laws. Decisions on establishing integrated neighborhoods will be made by an eight-member board dominated by government supporters. One member is black. The board is supposed to take community sentiment into consideration, and the government has made clear that no white neighborhoods will be integrated if there is significant opposition. `` This act does not change the present living and residential patterns of our communities,'' Acting President <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON> said last week. `` But it gives those people who wish to associate freely with one another the democratic choice to do so.'' Heunis is filling in for President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who is recuperating from a stroke. The Star, a liberal <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> newspaper with the country's largest daily circulation, acknowledged that the act will allow people of different races to live together legally for the first time since residential segregation was mandated by the Group Areas Act in 1950 `` Yet it does this in such a half-baked and limited way that it is likely to aggravate, not alleviate, slum conditions,'' said The Star in an editorial Tuesday. It predicted that a handful of `` free settlement'' areas will rapidly become overcrowded, leading to problems that the government will blame on integration. The 16 prisoners who had their death sentences commuted included one man of mixed-race and 15 blacks, among them <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Setlaba </PERSON>, convicted of committing murder during a 1985 black consumer boycott. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> gave no explanation for the action, merely listing the prisoners granted clemency. In each case, the death sentence was commuted to a prison term, ranging from 10 years to life. <PERSON> Setlaba </PERSON>'s planned execution was stayed by Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON> in November, hours before he was to be hanged. The stay followed appeals for clemency by human rights groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which depicted <PERSON> Setlaba </PERSON> as an anti-apartheid activist caught up in political unrest. Details of the other reprieved prisoners' cases were not disclosed. The release of 50 prisoners held without charge came in response to a series of hunger strikes by up to 400 inmates in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> `` gave the delegation his assurance that ... the process of releasing detainees would continue,'' church leaders said in a statement.

<HEAD>Administration Says Industrial Nations Must Pursue Non-Inflationary
Growth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Industrial nations must pursue non-inflationary economic growth to stimulate world trade and provide growing markets for their own exports and those of less-developed countries, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Wednesday in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The report from the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the Office of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its major trading partners were committed to making the changes needed to reduce imbalances in world trade. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, both countries with large trade surpluses, need to take steps to ensure open and growing domestic markets, the report said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, meanwhile, `` is committed to substantial federal budget deficit reductions, improving its international competitiveness, and bolstering its savings rate,'' it said. The report noted that most economies are structured in ways that can hinder international efforts to coordinate monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies to promote world trade. It said the industrial nations agreed at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> economic summit last year to pursue specific reforms that would reduce such barriers through steps such as cutting subsidies that impede the international flow of resources, reforming tax systems that discourage innovation, and reducing burdensome regulations. Such a course `` is well suited to producing medium-term solutions to what are, after all, medium-term problems,'' the report said. The report projected that without policy changes, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus in goods and services would drop `` significantly'' in the next two years from about $ 80 billion this year, while <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, with export growth rebounding, would see its overall surplus largely unchanged. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s ballooning of its trade deficit in 1988 is unlikely to be reversed, and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> should collectively have about the same deficit in 1990 that they did in 1988, it said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, meanwhile, expects to see increases in exports exceed growth in imports, although rising payments on the national debt will hold back the overall reductions in the trade deficit. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in 1988 posted its first improvement since 1980, narrowing to $ 137.34 billion from an all-time high of $ 170.32 billion in 1987. The report said less-developed countries also must move to promote world trade. These countries, especially those that are heavily in debt, must adopt policies that support domestic growth, reduce inflation, and encourage support from banks and international financial institutions, it said. The trade projection report was required under the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988.

 Islamic flags flew over <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> cities Wednesday as Moslem fundamentalists celebrated their victories in municipal elections, the results of which have frightened many Jews. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, competing for the first time in Tuesday's balloting, emerged as a growing influence among the 400,000 eligible Arab voters in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> The movement challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the traditional dominant force in <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> municipalities, and scored a landslide victory in <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fahem </LOCATION>, the second-largest <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> town. It also took over the three smaller cities of <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Bara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Kana </PERSON>, and won seats in four other city councils _ including six seats of the 19-member council in the town of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>, often called `` red Nazareth'' because of its Communist affiliation. Although Jewish leaders expressed fears that the results indicated growing extremism in the Arab sector, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> analysts said the Islamic movement had won because it provided badly needed municipal services. <PERSON> Lutfy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mashour </PERSON>, editor of the Arabic-language Sinara newspaper in <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>, said the Islamic victory was not `` a matter of religion, it's a matter of services.'' In <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fahem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Raed </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahajneh </PERSON>, a bearded, 30-year-old preacher, won more than 72 percent of the vote, or 11 of 15 seats on the city council, defeating the town's Communist mayor. `` Islam will sweep the world,'' a triumphant aide at Mahajneh's office said `` We in <LOCATION> Umm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fahem </LOCATION> take the best from the Communists and the best from the capitalists. This is Islam.'' Flags of Islam, traditionally green, flew over the <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> city of over 20,000 and jubilant residents circled through town in their cars plastered with green party stickers, creating a huge traffic jam. The fundamentalist victories alarmed Israeli Jewish leaders of virtually all parties. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>'s aim is to gain leadership in -LRB- <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s -RRB- Arab sector. It's a very worrisome sign,'' said Interior Minister <PERSON> Arye </PERSON> <PERSON> Deri </PERSON> of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party. <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Baram </PERSON> of the left-leaning Labor party said he preferred the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which `` at least grants legitimacy to the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and sees itself as part of it. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> is a dangerous movement,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. The Islamic Movement's leader, <PERSON> Sheikh </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimer </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwish </PERSON>, said his party would abide by the law and would not harm the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` by word or by deed.'' Arab analysts said the movement gained its power by providing services to the population. `` It's a local issue,'' said <PERSON> Hashem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachman </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Islamic movement. `` People saw that the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> gave them good services and voted according to what they saw.'' Analysts said it took the movement about five years of building schools and running volunteer camps to win over <ORGANIZATION> Umm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fahem </ORGANIZATION>, which an Arab reporter described as `` easily the worst slum in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Many roads in the city are not paved and there are serious sewage problems.

 <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s track coach testified Wednesday that he turned the Canadian sprinter on to steroids in 1981 because their use was necessary to keep up with the competition. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> won the gold medal and set a world record in the 100-meter race at the Summer Olympics in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> last year, but was stripped of both after he tested positive for steroid use. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> has maintained that he never knowingly used drugs to enhance his performance. But <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, who has been <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s coach since 1977, told a Canadian inquiry into drugs and sports that he put <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> on a steroid program in 1981. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said he first approached <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> about steroids that summer, but <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` was not sure of the advantages.'' That fall, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> `` decided he would go on.'' `` If he wanted to compete, it's pretty clear that steroids are worth a meter at the highest level of sports,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said. `` I think he understood that his competitors were on them.'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>' only previous statement since the Olympics was that the sprinter's urine test may have been sabotaged. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said that top-level international competition is virtually impossible without steroids. He cautioned against believing any claims from top-level athletes that they are clean and that their records are the result only of hard work. `` It just is n't true, not at the highest level,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said. He said repeatedly that steroids `` are not a short cut'' but the reason top-level athletes are able to train as hard as they do.

<TEXT>
 A hopelessly deadlocked <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, failing to reach a grand compromise to solve the nation's fiscal problems, issued a final report Wednesday that split essentially along party lines. The commission's seven Republicans and the one Democrat appointed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the president's 1990 fiscal budget, calling it a `` workable plan for eliminating the deficit'' without resorting to higher taxes. But the commission's six Democrats refused to go along with the majority report and instead issued a minority document which castigated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 1.16 trillion budget, charging that it employed unrealistic economic assumptions and failed to distribute the pain of deficit reduction equally among different segments of society. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> budget `` rules out any discussion of additional revenues and relies heavily on hard and disproportionate reductions in domestic spending, many of which have been rejected repeatedly by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' the Democrats wrote. However, the Democrats did not offer their own plan for dealing with the deficit and they did not specifically endorse higher taxes, although many of them have stated the need for higher revenues. The 14-member commission, which now goes out of existence, was labeled a huge disappointment by supporters, who once believed it offered the best hope in the early days of a new administration of crafting a workable compromise of spending cuts and tax increases that would balance the government's books. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the commission could have offered `` political cover'' for both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to make the hard choices needed to solve the deficit problem However, `` with little support or leadership from the president or <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the commission was unable to face up to the difficult issues. It had no choice but to punt,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said. Commission member Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., and a former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, blamed partisanship by Republicans for the group's failure to succeed `` The president did n't want a bipartisan deficit reduction plan. He wanted his own plan, the flexible freeze, and he insisted on it from <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. `` Instead of something bold that could have moved us forward, we end up leaving it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration to continue the fight.'' Both Democratic Co-Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> Co-Chairman </PERSON> <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said they were disappointed that the commission failed to come up with a solution to the deficit dilemma. While <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> blamed the stalemate on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s intransigence on the tax question, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said that the panel's work had also been made more difficult by a court suit brought by several news organizations which forced the panel to hold all of its meetings in open session. `` It was virtually impossible to meet as a bipartisan group and really hash out the tough issues with the press there,'' he said. Not everyone was disappointed with the outcome. Commission member <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> and one of the most outspoken opponents of tax increases, said the majority report reflected the `` will of taxpayers throughout the nation'' who had `` clearly indicated opposition to higher taxes and irresponsible spending.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the commission `` did the best they could.'' He said that specific suggestions made in the majority report for reforming the budget process were `` very useful.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been openly critical of the commission during the presidential campaign, saying if elected he would reject any report which called for higher taxes. The panel, which was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash, had the backing of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican primary opponent, Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. Both reports called for budget surpluses in future years to build up surpluses needed to cover the retirement of the `` Baby Boom'' generation. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> report offered a detailed list of suggestions for reforming the budget process, including a constitutional balanced-budget amendment, presidential line-item veto authority and greater involvement of the executive branch in the congressional budget process. Many of the ideas were long championed by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and have also been endorsed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Republican report also recommended a two-year budget process, replacing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committees </ORGANIZATION> with a joint panel and basing budget decisions on actual spending in the current year rather than projected spending levels for the next fiscal year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointed the final two members in December, former Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON>, R-Nev., and longtime friend <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Lud'' <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> who joined the Republicans in endorsing the majority report But he decided against extending the panel's March 1 reporting deadline for another six months, a step many on the panel had urged as a way of keeping the commission alive in the hopes that it eventually could reach a consensus. That decision basically sealed the panel's fate and with only a few weeks remaining, the panel abandoned efforts for any compromise and began drafting majority and minority reports. Republicans who joined <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> in signing the majority report were <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laxalt </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>; Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frenzel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., and former defense secretaries <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON> Democrats signing the minority report were <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration agents apprehended 27 more suspected illegal aliens Wednesday on a flight bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, bringing to 175 the number detained in a three-day government crackdown. <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agents, acting on a tip from a regular commuter on the <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight, were waiting for the 25 males and two females shortly before 7 a.m. during a stopover at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. The group on the flight, which originated in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, included two Mexicans, eight Brazilians, 14 El Salvadorans and three Ecuadorans, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. By 4 p.m., the detainees taken off the jetliner had been interviewed, fingerprinted, photographed and put on a bus for an Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> processing center near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The bust was part of a three-day crackdown against alien smuggling rings that netted 175 suspected illegal aliens in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, authorities said. None of the aliens spoke English. Most of them spent the day sleeping off the effects of their long ordeal, which began Monday night in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, the aliens boarded <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight 1277 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at 10 p.m. Monday night bound for <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. There, they boarded <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flight 1522 bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, with a stopover in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>. On Monday, 79 suspected illegal aliens were apprehended aboard an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight, also bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, during a stopover in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The same day, 69 others were taken into custody as they tried to board the same flight in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, said his agency was alerted by a regular commuter on the <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flight who had seen television news reports of Monday's apprehensions _ which also had stemmed from a commuter's tip. `` The source told us he had taken the same flight on February 15th and he noticed 30 to 40 people who looked to him like the same people he saw on the news,'' <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> office said one airline official told him Wednesday that smuggling rings have been moving as many as 30 aliens on the same <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flight three times a week for the past several months. `` The publicity we get out of this might cause it to dry up for awhile, and force them to change their tactics,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` But this is n't going to stop these people from coming into the country looking for work.'' <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said authorities were trying to determine whether any of the 27 taken into custody in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> were part of the smuggling ring. `` We're talking to a couple of them more than some of the others,'' he said. `` For example, one had six airline tickets in his possession when we took him into custody.'' Illegal aliens pay smugglers as much as $ 4,000 apiece to get them into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and to a place where they can find work. `` The arrangements are usually made before they ever leave home,'' <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who works out of the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the aliens would be given the opportunity to have a hearing before a deportation judge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> or choose to voluntarily leave the country. `` Most of them will be deported in a week or so,'' he said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the smuggling rings have been around for years but only recently have <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> officials found large groups of aliens booked on airline flights. Wednesday's operation was not the first time that illegal aliens have been removed from the same <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION> flight, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. On Oct. 6, 15 aliens were removed from the flight at the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> airport. Six days later, 17 more were seized, he said. `` The unique thing about this is that they are now flying in such large numbers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Assault Law Takes Effect, Gun Owners Confused</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Military style assault weapons and short-barreled shotguns became illegal here Wednesday under a disputed law that critics say has turned thousands of citizens into lawbreakers. The ban in the nation's second largest city, which took effect at midnight Tuesday, was driven by public outrage over street-gang warfare waged with military arms and by the Jan. 17 slaying of five schoolchildren in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> killer, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, used an AKM-47 assault rifle, a semiautomatic version of the gun used around the world by Soviet bloc troops, to gun down the children. He then killed himself with another weapon. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Gulart </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 20, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s half-brother, was arrested on weapons charges after his home was staked out by officers who had questioned him following the schoolyard killings. Police seized a semiautomatic 9mm <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> MAC-10 machine pistol, an M-1 carbine, ammunition, artillery shells, blasting caps and other explosives from <LOCATION> Gulart </LOCATION>'s home in <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, about 300 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police have said they will not actively look for owners of guns defined as illegal under the city's new law and by midday Wednesday there had been no arrests reported as a result of the new misdemeanor offense. Gun shop owners, aided by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, have challenged gun laws imposed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>. Gun owners were left confused by the possibility that the law they might be violating could be overturned or displaced by a state law. `` It puts the gun collector or owner in an awkward civic and economic position,'' said local gun owner <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. `` There could be a considerable investment involved. There has been no compensation addressed in the law. They're just telling people you have to get rid of them.'' Deputy City Attorney <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeckman </PERSON> suggested owners of the illegal weapons `` not take them outside of their homes except to take them to the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' He recommended that gun owners ask officers to keep custody of the weapons until the issue is decided in court. The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> challenge filed with the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> contends that the state rather than local government has the right to legislate gun ownership. <PERSON> Boeckman </PERSON> said the state has failed to show a clear intent to regulate assault rifles, leaving it open for local legislation. Even as those arguments were put forward, the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a ban on the sale of two dozen specified assault weapons, including the AK-47. Later, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> narrowly approved a broader bill. Both bills would allow anyone who lawfully possesses assault weapons before Oct. 1, 1989, to keep them by registering them with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. Both bills went fiscal committees, the last stop before the floors in each house. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, assistant general counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, said the organization was contacting lawmakers to lobby against the legislation. <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> ordinance probably has affected `` hundreds of thousands'' of gun owners in the city. The <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> voted 3-2 Tuesday not to ban semiautomatic weapons within the county's unincorporated areas. However, the board voted to support a statewide ban of such weapons. The ban in the city of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, approved by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in February, makes it a misdemeanor to own a semiautomatic gun. Sales of the guns within city limits became illegal immediately after passage of the ordinance. The measure bans semiautomatic rifles and carbines with a capacity of 20 rounds or more and short-barreled shotguns that hold six rounds or more. Banned by name are the Uzi, AK-47, AKM-47, AR-15, <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> MAC-10 and MAC-11.

 Thousands of people demonstrating against ethnic Albanians massed outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday while a senior official inside told lawmakers ethnic violence threatens to tear <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> apart. <PERSON> Lazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON>, a member of the ruling 12-man state presidency, also charged that an illegal group of ethnic Albanians has detailed plans to disrupt southern <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> province, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The integrity of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is jeopardized to the extreme degree,'' <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON> said in comments carried on <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> radio. The government indefinitely extended a ban on all public gatherings in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said, following more than a week of widespread unrest in the province. Outside Parliament, about 4,000 members of the <LOCATION> Serb </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montenegrin </LOCATION> minority from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> blocked streets and chanted songs to protest alleged persecution in the province by Albanians, who make up 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s estimated 2 million people. <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON> told the assembly 50,000 Slavs emigrated from <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since 1981 because of harassment. The flag-carrying protesters were joined by at least 10,000 <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> sympathizers. On Tuesday, a <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> rally led by <ORGANIZATION> Serbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> drew an estimated 500,000 people. Taxi drivers, carrying large portraits of <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> on their cars, provided free transportation for the elderly. The mainly Christian Serbs believe the predominantly Moslem Albanians in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, which was ancient <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s heartland, want to unite the province with neighboring <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. The ethnic Albanians have demanded that <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s autonomy not be restricted. Growing ethnic nationalism and an economic crisis have created the greatest threat to <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> unity since the 1980 death of President <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>, whose leadership held the loose confederation of six republics and two provinces together. The country's 23 million citizens belong to a number of different nationalities and religions. <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON> said the presidency has retrieved a document signed by members of `` an illegal <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> group,'' detailing plans for destabilizing the province, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. The plan's initial stage reportedly called for `` passive strikes in factories, firms, schools and universities'' and other actions, which <PERSON> Mojsov </PERSON> said were `` carried out in full'' last week. The Parliament met to discuss the deteriorating security in the country following the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> protests and counterdemonstrations by angry Serbs in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> and other parts of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. Frontier controls have been tightened to `` prevent the bringing in of explosives, arms, ammunition, hostile propaganda material and illegal crossings of the country's borders,'' Vice Premier <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemljaric </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. A ban on gatherings in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> was introduced in November when up to 100,000 ethnic <PERSON> Albanians </PERSON> demonstrated in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s capital <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> against the forced resignations of some top ethnic Albanian provincial leaders as demanded by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>. The ban, as extended Wednesday, also prohibits massive arrivals in the province. This was apparently designed to prevent Serbs from converging on <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>. The protesting Serbs and Montenegrins walked from the railroad station to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, jamming streets and interrupting traffic as <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> residents cheered them. At the station they were greeted by the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> theological seminary students choir, which sang Serbian Orthodox songs, banned until recently but now freely performed. <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, was peaceful Wednesday. More police, military personnel and army vehicles were seen in the area. <PERSON> Zemljaric </PERSON> said that 23,500 people in essential services in the provinces were ordered back to work. About 500 ethnic Albanians in the <LOCATION> Trepca </LOCATION> lead-zinc mine in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> continued their strike to protest Serbian plans to change constitutional provisions in a bid to win greater control over the province. On Monday, about 1,300 ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> miners at <ORGANIZATION> Trepca </ORGANIZATION> left the pits after their eight-day sit-in forced the resignation of three <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party leaders whom they consider pro-Serbian. Both <LOCATION> Croatia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s most economically-advanced republics, support the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>'s demands for guarantees that autonomy of their province will not be limited

 A unarmed federal drug agent shot to death in an undercover operation was wearing a radio transmitter and had five backup men, but they lost contact as he drove off with the man suspected of killing him, officials said Wednesday. The murder of undercover Special Agent <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> on Tuesday was the first killing of a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officer in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area since 1972, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strang </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and police issued an all-points bulletin for Constible `` Gus'' <PERSON> Farace </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> was released from the <ORGANIZATION> Elmira </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> in June 1988 after serving eight years for the 1979 kidnapping and murder of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> teen-ager, said police sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> said he would seek the death penalty under the new federal drug bill when <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s killer is caught. Investigators do not believe <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s `` cover was blown or that he was known to be a law enforcement officer,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doran </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Criminal Division. `` This was not a ` buy and bust' situation. There were no drugs present. There was no money present,'' <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> said. `` The killing was out of cold-bloodedness as far as we can determine.'' He said <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s wire had not been disturbed. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> was found slumped over the wheel of an unmarked car on a dead-end street on <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> at 10:15 p.m. Tuesday, shot four times in the head and upper body, apparently from outside the car, authorities said. Shortly after 9 p.m., <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> notified his back-up team that he and <PERSON> Farace </PERSON> were going to drive their cars to a diner, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> bureau. `` Shortly after that they -LRB- the agents -RRB- lost contact with the transmitter,'' <PERSON> Stutman </PERSON> said. He said they had dropped back so as not to be spotted and there was considerable traffic. The back-up team lost sight of <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> and began looking for the agent, without success, at various diners on the boulevard until returning to the original meeting area and finding <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>'s car. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 46, had worked at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office since joining the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. At the time of his death, the agent was part of a joint DEA-FBI Task Force engaged in a long-term drug investigation, officials said. Two other <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents have been shot and wounded in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in the last six months, but none has been killed in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area since October 12, 1972, when Special Agent <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Tummillo </PERSON> was shot in a midtown hotel. Tummillo's partner, Supervisory Agent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, died Sept. 25, 1982, of wounds he suffered during the 1972 shooting, <PERSON> Strang </PERSON> said.

 It is n't easy adopting smoking restrictions in the heart of tobacco country, as the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> discovered when it tried to put a stringent smoking policy into effect last fall. But it is possible, and new regulations went into effect Wednesday that try to give campus smokers and non-smokers equal rights to puff and not be puffed upon. `` I hope that this is an issue that we can put behind us,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a university official who met twice with the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to iron out details that did n't set well with lawmakers representing <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> burley producers. `` It's a hard issue for anybody who lives in a tobacco state,'' said <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, dean of the university's School of Nursing. The revised regulations, approved by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON> last month, did away with an especially controversial provision in the original regulations that would have favored non-smokers in disputes with smokers. After the first draft drew fire last November, some lawmakers threatened to cut the university's budget. But in December, the university agreed to rewrite portions of the policy to make sure smokers and non-smokers would be treated evenhandedly. Under the revision, department heads will discuss and settle conflicts over smoking with employees and their supervisors. `` The university feels that it's been responsive to the concerns of many of the legislators in those two meetings, and my hope is that it will be received as such,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. The new policy bans smoking in classrooms and elevators, as did the early proposal, but calls for more modest restrictions in hallways, lounges and other public areas, where smoking will be allowed in designated areas. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the rules would be introduced gradually as signs are printed and posted designating the smoking and non-smoking areas. Ms. <PERSON> Speer </PERSON> said nursing students and faculty worked out their own smoking policy several months ago, before the issue surfaced campus-wide. Nursing faculty members _ none of whom smoke _ and students voted not to smoke in halls outside classrooms, Ms. <PERSON> Speer </PERSON> said. Smoking is also prohibited inside classrooms. The nursing students' lounge is divided for smokers and non-smokers, and staff members have separate lounges, she said. Although the school is sensitive to the issues of tobacco farmers, it also wants to provide a `` healthful environment'' to non-smokers, she said. `` There are very few people in our area who smoke anymore,'' she said. `` It's just like people have learned.''

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has 36 firm <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> votes in favor of confirming him as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary with 36 Democrats committed in opposition and 27 senators describing themselves as uncommitted, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. The uncommitted senators include 19 Democrats and eight Republicans. When the tally is altered to reflect senators who are leaning either for or against the nomination, but not firmly committed, the result is 42-39 against Tower. That count includes Republican <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> against Tower, the only <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> counted as a possible vote against confirmation. No Democrats are considered leaning in favor of a `` yes'' vote. One senator, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, refused to reply to the survey even though a spokesman said he has made up his mind. Confirmation requires a simple majority. Democrats hold a 55-45 majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, so Tower would need to hold all Republicans and gain five Democrats to give Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a chance to cast the tie-breaking vote for his confirmation. Here, in alphabetical order, is the vote count as of Wednesday on the Tower nomination. A `` Y'' is a vote for Tower, an `` N'' against him and a `` U'' is either undecided or undeclared: <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., N; <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>, R-Colo., U; <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., N; <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., N; <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, R-Mo., Y; <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., N; <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn., Y; <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., U; <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, D-Nev., N; Bumpers, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., U; <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, R-Mont., Y; <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-R.I. </LOCATION>, Y; Coats, R-Ind., Y; <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., Y; <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, Y; <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., U; <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, Y; <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., Y; <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., U; <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill., N; Dodd, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., U; <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., Y; <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Minn </LOCATION>., Y; <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., N; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, D-Ky., U; <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON>, D-Ga., N; <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, Y; <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., N; <PERSON> Gorton </PERSON>, R-Wash., Y; <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., N; <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, Y; <PERSON> Grassley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, Y; <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., U; <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., U; <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa., Y; <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, Y; <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, Y; <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, R-Vt., U; <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., U; <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., U; <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis., Y; <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., N; <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb., N; <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., N; <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis., N; <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., N; <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., N; <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., Y; <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., Y; <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., Y; <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>., Y; <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, Y; <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky., Y; <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., U; <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, -LRB- refused to respond -RRB-; <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Okla </LOCATION>., Y; <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., N; <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., Y; <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Pressler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.D. </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., U; <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev., N; <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., N; <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va., U; <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, N; <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., U; <PERSON> Rudman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, Y; <LOCATION> Sanford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, U; <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., U; <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., U; <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala., N;

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, his nomination as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary in grave trouble, made an extraordinary public admission of marital infidelity Wednesday but vowed to keep fighting for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. His prospects dimmed further, however, by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader's opposition. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to court Democrats in a last-ditch effort to save the appointment, and spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> asserted, `` We'll just keep up the good fight.'' But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> further dampened Tower's chances by declaring his opposition, even as Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> conceded the administration still lacks the votes needed for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval. The president said his appeal to senators has been, `` Look, do what you've got to do, but remember fair play, remember decency and honor and then remember also historically the concept of advise and consent where reasonable doubt is given historically to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> who after all is responsible for the executive branch of this government.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dispatched <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to lobby for the nomination. `` We hope the prospects improve. We do n't have 50 votes yet. But we're moving in that direction,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> photo session. The White House effort failed with at least one conservative Democrat, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, who announced his opposition to the nomination and urged Tower to withdraw. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> was one of two Democrats to vote for former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s unpopular <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who had been invited to a White House session with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, declared his opposition, saying Tower `` is just not the right person for the position of secretary of defense.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> announced that floor debate on the nomination had been postponed until Thursday as the ranking members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., met with <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to decide what material from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report could be made Tower showed flashes of grit and humor as he fielded questions at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> about allegations concerning excessive drinking, womanizing and lucrative consulting fees he received from defense contractors. Asked whether he would ask that his name be withdrawn, he replied by quoting from the last letter written by Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, the leader of the Texans who fought and died at the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION>: `` I shall never surrender or retreat.'' The former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator paused briefly and said, `` I am a little sorry I brought up the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> analogy. It just occurred to me what happened at the <LOCATION> Alamo </LOCATION> just 10 days after <PERSON> Travis </PERSON> wrote that letter.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> defenders were wiped out by the Mexicans. Tower said he regards his weekend vow to quit drinking if he wins confirmation as `` sacred ... and I can assure you I will abide by it.'' His speech addressed defense policy issues, matters Tower said `` normally occupy the mind of the nominee of secretary of defense.'' But he unflinchingly fielded questions from his audience about his personal behavior. Asked whether he had ever broken his wedding vows, the twice-divorced Tower said, `` As a matter of fact, I have broken wedding vows. I think I am probably not alone in that connection.'' Tower's second wife, <PERSON> Lilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummings </PERSON>, alleged `` marital misconduct'' in court papers in the couple's divorce case. But later Wednesday, Tower aides released a statement clarifying his admission of marital infidelity, and administration sources indicated Tower was referring to his first marriage, not his second. The statement noted that Tower, in his opening testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, repeatedly stated that he had never been unfaithful to his second wife. `` The senator stands by his statement, and he notes that marriage vows have to do with a great deal more than the question of infidelity,'' the statement said. `` However, the senator's oath and pledge to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people is of the same character as is the oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>; an oath he has never broken.'' Administration sources, who insisted on anonymity, elaborated by disclosing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had been told that Tower was divorced from his first wife, <PERSON> Lou </PERSON>, because of an adulterous affair with the woman who became his second wife. There was no letup, meanwhile, in the political storm surrounding the nomination. The administration is trying to hold all 45 Republicans and sway five of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s 55 Democrats to get a tie vote that <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could break in favor of Tower. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> found 36 Republicans supporting the nomination, 36 Democrats opposed and 27 other senators undecided or undeclared. One senator was unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, the Democratic leader, announced his opposition to the nomination in a midday speech on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, citing Tower's ties to defense consultants and his drinking. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s position was widely anticipated, particularly since all Democrats who have expressed an opinion on the nomination have opposed it, and almost all Republicans have endorsed it. Turning to the controversy over Tower's personal conduct, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told his colleagues that `` it is not moral perfection or the qualifications of senators that are at issue here. It is the ability to serve effectively in a position of unique power and responsibility.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he read the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report on Tower and met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House where he expressed his concerns about the nomination. `` It is only after careful study of this record that I have concluded that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> is not the man to provide leadership by example to the military and civilian employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, especially in the difficult job of reforming the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s administration and procurement practices in a period of budget stringency,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Tower lashed out at what he said was the absence of clearly defined standards against which he was being judged. He noted that several senators have said that the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION>, as the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces behind only the president, must adhere to a higher standard. `` I accept that ... but my question is how much,'' he said. He then asked whether it is `` acceptable for members late in the evening who had a few drinks in hideaways ... to come onto the floor late in the evening and vote on vital issues of nuclear deterrence,'' or to accept speaking fees, campaign contributions and paid vacations `` from special interests who have a vested interest in the legislative process.''

 Officials of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> met at the border on Thursday and resumed talks on a possible meeting between their prime ministers. Delegates from the two sides exchanged greetings at the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce site and chatted for about 10 minutes before beginning formal deliberations. Last month's talks bogged down after <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded a halt to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises. The <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> government repeated that demand Wednesday. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said the talks can not progress unless the `` Team Spirit'' exercises, an annual event since 1976, are canceled. `` The South Koran authorities should, first of all, have a corrrect fundamental stand and attitude toward the dialogue and take a determined stand of discontinuing the ` Team Spirit' joint military exercises at once,'' <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a report monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Another factor that may affect the dialogue would be <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s blocking of dissidents from meeting with North Korean officials on national unification Wednesday South Korean dissidents, defying a government ban, scheduled the meeting at the truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, but police overpowered and arrested 28 dissidents heading to the site. Before the Feb. 8 meeting at the border village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, hopes were high the countries would be able to agree on terms for the prime ministers' meeting. It would be the highest-ranking meeting ever between communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and capitalist <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Despite the North Korean demand, military officials of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have made it clear they will not halt this year's exercises. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> observers believe the hardened <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> stand also is expected to affect a scheduled meeting March 9 between sports officials of the two nations to form a single delegation to the 1990 Asian Games in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. It's also believed <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> may be displeased with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent visit to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and last week's defection to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> of two North Korean students. While in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s security commitment to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue its military presence. About 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> struggled Wednesday to avert a weekend Machinists strike, offering pilots sweeter pay, job security and other promises if they sign a new contract and defy a walkout by fellow workers. `` If the pilots and other employees support the picket line and do n't show up for work, Eastern can not survive,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a videotaped message sent to pilots of the unprofitable airline. The pilots' participation is considered pivotal to the success of the Machinists' strike, which is to begin at 12:01 a.m. Saturday unless there is a breakthrough in the union's 17-month-old contract negotiations. Leaders of the pilots' union have urged their 3,500 members to honor Machinists picket lines but indicated last week they would reconsider if management made contract concessions to them. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s message marked the most dramatic appeal yet by management to quell the latest in a series of labor crises that have afflicted Eastern for years and have have helped bring it close to bankruptcy. He promised a five-year pilots pact with pledges of no furloughs and offered other protections in the event Eastern sought bankruptcy court protection or was merged into sister <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The pact also offers 3 percent pay increases for 1992 and 1993. The pilots union reacted skeptically and said close inspection showed little substance to <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s words. `` In his videotape, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> made a fine theatrical performance,'' the pilots executive council said in a statement to members. `` Do n't be misled Much work still needs to be done.'' The council said the offer does n't pledge job security and actually contains $ 64 million in concessions, plus a demand that pilots drop longstanding grievances it said were worth an additional $ 250 million. `` The company has gone outside the normal bargaining process and directly to the pilots,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, spokesman for the Eastern local of the pilots' union. `` We think this is just part of a continuing disinformation campaign designed to divide the pilots' group. The pilots' master executive council went into special session Wednesday afternoon in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. In other developments Wednesday: _ A federal judge took under consideration <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request to hire outside contractors to service 26 aircraft on the ground but did not say whether he would rule before the strike deadline. _ Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> said they were seeking a federal court order allowing Machinists to picket other airlines with which the international union has contracts. _ Eastern employees reported receiving formal notification of possible layoffs and plant closings, under the new federal 60-day plant closing notification law. Eastern, which says it has lost more than $ 1 billion in the past decade and is losing more than $ 1 million a day, wants $ 150 million in wage concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, who represent 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground services workers. More talks were expected with the company on a contract addressing pilots' demands for job security, a long-term financial commitment to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, and an agreement to keep <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> routes from being transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s predominantly non-union carrier. `` We would hope the pilots would remember that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s made agreements before and contracts mean nothing to him. He's not to be trusted,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, vice president of Machinists Local 702. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> earned a union-busting reputation when, faced with labor strife at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, he filed for federal bankruptcy reorganization and got <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> labor contracts abrogated. Eastern apparently would have to use management pilots and possibly recently hired pilots to fly if the pilots' union honored the machinists' picket lines. The flight attendants' union leadership has urged its 5,900 Eastern members to honor Eastern picket lines. In Wednesday's court hearing, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> took under consideration <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request for permission to hire outside contractors to service its aircraft. Eastern attorneys said 26 of its approximately 250 planes are on the ground awaiting service because of a Machinists slowdown. The company also reported incidents of vandalism. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> KTTV </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has contracted with outside companies, including concerns based in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, to service its planes during a strike. <ORGANIZATION> Elsinore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Downey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is among companies hired, the station said. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said the company would n't discuss strike contingency plans. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrieri </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the machinists were seeking an emergency declaration with the federal court to allow the union's members to picket other airlines that have contracts with the union. They are <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. A favorable court ruling could result in Machinists honoring picket lines at those carriers, he said. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officials have said they want their 14 million members to boycott <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and help the Machinists in a strike. The Machinists said they will picket other airlines, ships and other transportation services.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army chief of staff on Wednesday defended the policy of beating Palestinian rioters but acknowledged that in many cases the individual soldier decides how much force to use. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> made the comments as he testified in the trial of four soldiers charged with manslaughter in the beating death of a 42-year-old Arab refugee last August. It was the army chief's most comprehensive explanation to date of a policy that prompted harsh foreign criticism after pictures of soldiers clubbing Palestinians were seen on worldwide television. He said beating as punishment was prohibited and force should not be used once a riot is over. `` Deterrence is not the goal, overcoming violence is,'' <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said, `` but when someone stops resisting, that's a matter of opinion.'' In another development Wednesday, soldiers arrested two Palestinians who tried to stab and kidnap a Jewish settler in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, the army reported. An army spokeswoman said a car `` approached in a suspicious manner'' when a settler left his vehicle, then two men jumped out and one tried to stab the settler while the other pushed him into the car. The settler escaped and alerted soldiers, who closed the area and erected roadblocks, the spokeswoman said. The Palestinians abandoned their vehicle and fled on foot. Also Wednesday, anonymous telephone callers to a news agency and to an Arab lawyer demanded the release of all Palestinian prisoners held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in exchange for the release of an Israeli paratrooper. <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassportas </PERSON>, 21, has been missing since Feb. 16, when he disappeared on his way home to <LOCATION> Ashdod </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, testifying before a three-judge military court, said orders issued to commanders on Feb. 23, 1988 regarding beatings outlined proper procedures. The army has contended that beatings are necessary to subdue riots which have raged in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> since the Palestinian uprising broke out Dec. 8, 1987. `` Dispersing a violent demonstration must be done with force,'' <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said. `` Let us be clear these are not demonstrations over food subsidies, but violent demonstrations that endanger the lives of our soldiers.'' `` You can beat someone to prevent an incident, disperse a violent demonstration or to stop someone who is resisting an arrest,'' he said. The three privates and a first sergeant are charged in the beating death Aug. 22 of <PERSON> Hani </PERSON> <PERSON> Shami </PERSON>, 42, at the <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. They face maximum prison terms of 20 years if convicted. Earlier testimony said a stone-thrower the soldiers were pursuing ran into <PERSON> Shami </PERSON>'s house and, when <PERSON> Shami </PERSON> tried to keep them out, the soldiers broke the door down, threw him to the ground, beat him with a broom and kicked him. An autopsy determined he died of a punctured lung, and at least 12 of his ribs were broken. The courtroom's 50 seats were full Wednesday and relatives of the defendants, who served in the elite <ORGANIZATION> Givati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, were seated behind them. Final statements in the case are expected next week. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Uziel </PERSON> <PERSON> Atzmon </PERSON> repeatedly asked <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> precisely when beatings were legal and when they were not. `` You are asking me about gray areas and asking for clear answers,'' said <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, who spent 2 -LCB- hours on the stand. `` Soldiers are told to use their own judgment _ how severe the situation is and how much force is necessary. `` It is possible that these events will be seen as a deviation. It shows how difficult the situation is.'' `` I am responsible for the orders given but not for the actions of every soldier,'' he testified. `` I expect the soldiers will fulfill their legal orders. `` If officers give orders to troops that are not legal, it is no doubt proper to investigate these orders.'' At least 387 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising, most shot to death in confrontations with soldiers, and 17 Israelis have been killed. Thousands of Palestinians have been wounded or beaten. Six Palestinians were reported wounded by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers Wednesday, three in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and three at the Khan Yunis refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Those wounded at the camp included an 8-year-old boy shot in the chest, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said.

 Illegal immigrants are being housed in tents after the dormitories at a southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> detention center filled up with rejected applicants for political asylum, an immigration official said Wednesday. Twenty-eight men slept in a tent Tuesday night, after the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ran out of bed space for male detainees in buildings at the minimum-security center here, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kice </PERSON> said. `` This is the first time the tents have been deployed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kice </PERSON> said. `` We've reached our capacity.'' The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, faced with a flood of Central Americans it maintains are filing `` frivolous'' applications for political asylum after illegally crossing the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> into southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, has begun a two-pronged get-tough effort. On Feb. 21, the agency began immediate arrest and detention of asylum-seekers whose cases are denied. At the same time, it added more than 100 new Border Patrol agents to police the border. Asylum applicants previously were allowed to travel to their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> destinations after checking in with the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> reported this week that half of the applicants fail to show up for interviews there. Of the first 352 applications for asylum in southern <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> under the week-old procedure, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> granted asylum in just 10 cases, all Nicaraguans. It denied 319 and issued `` intents to deny'' for the remaining 23. An intent-to-deny notice means applicants have 15 days to present documentation to bolster borderline cases. Political asylum is granted to those fleeing persecution. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> contends that most of the Central Americans seeking asylum are here for economic reasons and do not qualify for political refugee status. Although the number of applicants for asylum has dwindled under the new policy, Central Americans are still trying to cross the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, authorities say. `` They're still coming across,'' <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> intelligence agent <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>. `` We're pretty well swamped There's no doubt about it.'' On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agents apprehended 249 non-Mexican undocumented aliens and encountered one man who fired several shots into a Border Patrol vehicle. The man escaped by jumping back into the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> says it could house as many as 5,000 adults in tents at its <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the lockup near <LOCATION> Bayview </LOCATION>, about 20 miles northeast of the border city of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. Seven large, brightly colored, striped tents so far have been erected at the detention center. And 27 more illegal immigrants were being taken to the detention center Wednesday after being arrested on an airplane in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> Officials there said the aliens, arrested aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, had been put on a bus to the immigration center near <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>. The total number of detainees hat <LOCATION> Bayview </LOCATION> on Wednesday was 1,011, 697 men and 314 women, including the 28 men in the tents. Some space remained available in the women's fixed dormitory area, Ms. <PERSON> Kice </PERSON> said. Family groups are sent to an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelter in <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, where 711 slept Tuesday night, double the number there a month ago. The shelter's capacity is 800.

 The wife of convicted spy <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> should be denied her request for independent medical care, as well as her wish to be transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, a federal magistrate recommended Wednesday.

She is serving two concurrent five-year prison terms on charges related to her husband's spy activities. `` The record here supports a clear finding of no deliberate indifference to her serious medical needs,'' <PERSON> Symchych </PERSON> said in rebuffing <PERSON> Henderson-Pollard </PERSON>'s request for an independent medical examination and treatment. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> warden <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogan </PERSON>, she said, should be `` commended for his efforts to sensitively balance the medical needs of the petitioner with the security needs of an orderly penal administration of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prisons </ORGANIZATION>.''

 They oohed and aahed at Times Square and the Statue of Liberty, then gasped when the tour bus squeezed within 2 inches of a truck as it maneuvered through <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s clogged streets on Wednesday. The folks from <LOCATION> Bolan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, were clearly a long way from home. `` You'll never run into this traffic in <LOCATION> Bolan </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nydegger </PERSON>. `` I like to visit but I sure would n't want to live here.'' `` We wave at everybody. They give each other the bird,'' said <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McCready </PERSON>, comparing motorists in <LOCATION> Bolan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The entire population of <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON>'s metropolitan area _ six <LOCATION> Bolanites </LOCATION> and 10 from the `` suburbs'' _ had taken <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> up on his offer to visit the big city. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>, prompted by a staffer intrigued by <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON>, paid for the Iowans to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for three days and appear on his show, `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>.'' On the show, <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> immediately tried to dig up the dirt on a town where everybody knows everybody and then some. `` Do you have a town slut?'' he asked <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, 73. `` If so, when she comes up, point her out.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a 50-year resident, chuckled at that. She and <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON>'s oldest resident, <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMaris </PERSON>, 78, were interviewed during Wednesday's taping of the show to air early Thursday. Then <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> brought the whole town onstage. <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> also put on the spot <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Nydegger </PERSON>, 23, a weekend resident who helped organize a standstill parade _ it does n't move and spectators walk around it _ to celebrate the town's 100th anniversary three years ago. `` So, you're just here for the free trip,'' <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> said as she blushed and shook her head. `` Let's string her up.'' Mrs. <PERSON> DeMaris </PERSON>, who is confined to a wheelchair, said in an interview afterwards that she did n't want to make the trip because of her physical condition but the <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> staff insisted on the entire town's attendance. `` When they told me the rest of them could n't go if I did n't, I decided I would n't make them people stay home because of me,'' she said. `` I'll be tired tomorrow. I'm going home on the morning flight but it was well worth it.'' After the show, the <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON> residents headed off for dinner at a <ORGANIZATION> Beefsteak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charlie </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, courtesy of <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>. `` It's like a dream. You do n't want it to stop,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahams </PERSON>, who along with the others will each be paid $ 150 for appearing on the show. `` We've had this red carpet treatment. They've just rolled it out.'' The visitors planned to watch the show during a party they were planning for their hotel rooms at the Mayflower Hotel, where they were staying. At home, friends were house-sitting all the houses in <LOCATION> Bolan </LOCATION>, and the post-bowling crowd at JJ's Tavern in nearby <LOCATION> Northwood </LOCATION> was expected to linger longer than usual to catch the <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON> show on the TV above the bar. `` I do n't think there's anybody in <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> that wo n't be watching it,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> VanHorn </PERSON>, a secretary in the county sheriff's department. On the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> tour, which included a ferry ride to the Statue of Liberty, a bewildered Ms. <PERSON> Nydegger </PERSON> asked `` What's that?'' when a car alarm went off for no apparent reason. A few minutes later, she heard a man cursing loudly, also for no obvious reason, as he walked on the other side of the street. `` Oh my,'' she said. `` They get kind of mad, do n't they?'' Her brother, <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>, 17, said he was `` asked for money twice in one block.'' `` I'm glad I grew up where I did,'' he said. In <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON>, there is an antique shop, a Methodist church and the <ORGANIZATION> Bolan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns three-fourths of the town's property and sells farm equipment and supplies. The store is for sale. Each week, about 30 people attend church services. `` Practically all the women are in the choir,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nydegger </PERSON> said. `` They have to be or we would n't have one. My brother rings the bell, lights the candles and brings up the offering.'' The 103-year-old community at one time had as many as 75 residents as well as a blacksmith, a train depot, lumber yards and stockyards, a blacksmith shop and a creamery. But the automobile changed everything and <PERSON> Bolan </PERSON>'s population has remained relatively stable _ and small _ the last 20 years. There were only five residents until <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yanacheak </PERSON> moved into the community last October. `` The other 10 of us are in the suburbs,'' <PERSON> McCready </PERSON> said, which is n't more than a block away. The Iowans rarely see motorists as they drive five miles through corn and soybean country to <LOCATION> Grafton </LOCATION>, which has a post office, and <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, which is 22 miles away and has a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant. It's a two-hour drive to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and 2 -LCB- hours to <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCready </PERSON> said he and his neighbors are enjoying the trip even though they know some people are poking fun at them. `` We have to laugh at ourselves too,'' he said. `` Main street is 720 feet long and it ends in a dead end in a corn field.'' But he added, `` When we see the mess and utter confusion of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, I would n't sell my 88 acres for 88 acres in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, unless I could sell it and move back to peace and quiet.''

 <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, fresh from his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary triumph over Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, rallied his forces Wednesday for a three-way general election battle against a black alderman and a Republican nominee still to be crowned. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, son of the late, six-term political boss, Mayor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, drew overwhelming white support Tuesday and benefited from low voter turnout, especially among blacks, to oust <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, a black former alderman. The victory made <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> first among the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities to have a black incumbent mayor defeated by a white in an election. <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, a three-term <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney, now faces a third-party challenge in the April 4 general election from <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a popular black alderman who has the support of <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, and who also hit the campaign trail Wednesday. The outcome of the Republican primary, normally barely noticed in this heavily Democratic city, remained in doubt Wednesday. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, a white former Democratic alderman and <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> foe who launched a write-in candidacy only a week ago, claimed a victory that if upheld could cut into <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s core constituency. With five weeks of campaigning ahead, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> was up at dawn to greet commuters and tape a television appearance. `` I think my father's looking down upon me, on a beautiful, warm day in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ... very proud of me, and most importantly, proud of the type of campaign that I ran in the last three months _ reaching out to every community,'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> said on `` CBS This Morning.'' At a commuter rail station, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> pledged to avoid racial divisiveness in the campaign's next phase: `` I'm going to be vying for votes of everybody throughout this city and this is a city made up of the black community, the white commmunity, the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION>, the Hispanic community.'' He predicted `` a good clean election.'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said his political career was n't over but suggested he would not back <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> or <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. `` My general sense is that I will not endorse anyone,'' he said. `` I am thinking it through and I've got a lot of people to talk to before I decide.'' With 2,843 of 2,911 precincts, or 98 percent, reporting, <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> had 481,370 votes, or 56 percent, to 367,919 votes, or 43 percent, for <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>. Three other candidates shared the remaining Democratic votes, while the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race between <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON> was considered too close to call Wednesday. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 45, previously <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>'s chief black rival, maintained a low profile during the primary campaign. But he began campaigning Wednesday at 6:45 a.m., shaking hands with voters at an elevated train station and promising to crush the `` Daley machine.'' <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, 51, had no formal appearances scheduled Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday's official canvass would determine the Republican outcome With 96 percent of 2,911 percincts reporting, unofficial results gave <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> 10,711 votes, or 45 percent, to 10,234 votes, or 43 percent for <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>. Two other candidates each had 5 percent. The elections board estimated that 64.5 percent of the city's nearly 1.55 million voters went to the polls Tuesday <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>'s primary triumph gave him an advantage in the general election, a contest Democrats have won without fail since 1931. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> congratulated <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and offered his full support to the party nominee. In doing so, the first black chairman of a national political party broke with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whom he had served as convention manager last summer. `` Tough contests and hard-fought politics are nothing new to Democrats and certainly not to Democrats in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said in a statement. `` The emphasis for all Democrats now must be on unity and conciliation.'' <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> proved his effectiveness as a political organizer, winning broad-based support among white ethnics and Hispanics in the primary. But he must work to gain support in the black community, analysts said. If <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON>, a slick campaigner and nemesis of the late Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, is declared the winner over <PERSON> Sohn </PERSON>, observers said the white vote in the general election could be split between <PERSON> Vrdolyak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, giving <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> the edge. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> became the city's first black mayor after winning the 1983 Democratic primary, in which the younger <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> and incumbent <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> split the white vote. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gained support from liberal whites and Hispanics to repeat in 1987, becoming the first mayor since the elder <PERSON> Daley </PERSON> to win re-election. But he died in office without having annointed a successor, touching off a war between <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> that caused a deep rift in the black community.

<TEXT>
 Riots broke out Wednesday in the western slums despite martial law, and a newspaper said more than 200 people were killed in the <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> area alone in three days of violence over price increases. At least nine people were reported killed on Wednesday. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nacional </ORGANIZATION> said in its early Thursday edition that more than 1,000 people were injured and 2,000 were arrested in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> since riots _ triggered by a wide-ranging government austerity program _ began on Monday. The newspaper listed the names of 159 persons whose bodies were in the <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> morgue, which it said was `` congested with corpses.'' It said there was a `` high number of corpses in other <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> morgues.'' The independent newspaper quoted unidentified police sources and gave no details. Government ministers maintained that calm had been largely restored to <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, but they censored international TV broadcasts from <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>. The army began to airlift food from the interior of the country to supply <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> residents running low on supplies as a result of rioting and looting. Sporadic gunfire could be heard just blocks from the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> office as a 6 p.m. curfew fell over the city. <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendoza </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION> resident, said soldiers were piling people into jeeps and taking them away outside her building to enforce the curfew, which was announced Tuesday night. Fighting continued in <LOCATION> Petare </LOCATION>, a shantytown east of the capital, and local hospitals were full of injured, a parish priest said. Officials refused comment on numbers of dead or injured. A witness reported that an army unit shot mobs sacking a food store in <LOCATION> Petare </LOCATION> after loudspeaker appeals failed to stop the looting, a doctor who lives in <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Petare </LOCATION>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The doctor said four people were shot to death. There was no independent confirmation. The government called on workers to return to their workplaces on Thursday, saying violence was `` practically controlled.'' Most businesses were closed on Wednesday. Before the curfew, Venezuelans jammed the few remaining open food stores, which were guarded by soldiers. Police battled with snipers in <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tacagua </LOCATION>, a shantytown in the hills west of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, and broke up mobs of looters in <LOCATION> Catia </LOCATION>, also a slum to the west of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rumbo </ORGANIZATION>, a local station. An AP photographer said he saw at least four bodies of people who had been shot Wednesday in <LOCATION> Catia </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Chapellin </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, an elderly woman died in her apartment from a wild bullet fired during gunbattles between army units and residents of a nearby slum, said eyewitnesses. Radio reporters said delinquents were trying to break into homes in <LOCATION> Guarenas </LOCATION>, about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, while homeowners were defending themselves with gunfire. Interior Minister <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Izaguirre </PERSON> acknowledged there had been fighting in the capital but said `` calm has been restored to the rest of the country.'' President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> declared martial law late Tuesday, saying the `` incredible tragedy'' of the violence threatened <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s `` consolidation of democracy. `` I blame the authorities, because we warned them we would need protection way in advance,'' said Spanish-born businessmen <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Taboada </PERSON>, whose four shoe stores were sacked by the looters. He estimated his losses and damages at $ 2.6 million. Bus fare increases of 30 percent to 50 percent, and price gouging by drivers were the immediate cause of the riots, but oil accounts for 90 percent of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s export income and the economy never recovered from the plunge in world prices several years ago. Inflation is expected to reach 70 percent this year, double the 1988 level, and the foreign debt is $ 33 billion. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, in office only four weeks, announced a sweeping reform package under pressure from international creditors. It includes freeing interest rates, doubling gasoline prices and letting the currency float, which means higher prices for imports. Correspondents from Spanish and West German television said state-owned television and telephone companies refused to transmit images of the violence overseas. A government spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there had been restrictions imposed because televised reports of the disturbances were `` too crude.'' It was unclear whether the censorship was connected to the imposition of martial law, which prohibits public gatherings, suspends the right to privacy and freedom of the press and permits detention without charge. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said industrialists and the Venezuelan Confederation of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, the most powerful labor group, agreed to an across-the-board raise of 2,000 bolivars a month, or about $ 52. That would mean a raise of more than 50 percent for people on the minimum wage.

 A high-level advisory group once seen as the best hope for crafting a bipartisan solution to the nation's budget problems ended up deadlocked, issuing a final report today that splits essentially along party lines.

The administration's $ 1.16 trillion spending plan for 1990 `` rules out any discussion of additional revenues and relies heavily on harsh and disproportionate reductions in domestic spending,'' the Democrats said.

 Premier was a cigarette designed for people who hate cigarettes: a butt that did n't cause cancer, that did n't cloud the air with smoke, that did n't even dribble ashes.

<HEAD>High Interest Rates Gain a Growing Fan Club</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Warning: Many of your fellow citizens these days are quietly rooting for interest rates to keep rising. Though they may not noise it around, they'd be happy to see the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> continue to tighten credit, even to the point of slowing economic growth and restraining the number of new businesses and jobs. Who are these anti-growth Scrooges? Well, chances are their numbers include at least some of your affable, law-abiding and patriotic neighbors _ and maybe even you. You would certainly qualify for inclusion in this group if, for instance, you have a fixed-rate mortgage on your house, which would be unaffected by any change in current interest rates, and a chunk of your savings in a floating-rate investment such as a money market mutual fund. A decade or two ago, it was generally agreed that only a banker could love high interest rates. While the costs of borrowing went up, savers got little benefit, since the government set limits on rates paid to depositors -LRB- as in the fabled 5 \ percent savings account -RRB- But in the modern world of deregulated finance, all that has changed. People who are fixed-rate borrowers and floating-rate investors see their incomes rise as interest rates go up, with no concomitant increase in their expenses. This viewpoint is by no means a unanimous one. Families with floating-rate mortgages right now are bracing for a blow to their checkbooks the next time their monthly payments are recalculated. The impact is even more immediate on borrowers who have flocked to the popular home equity loans in the past few years. With much home-equity credit, the interest cost goes up in lockstep with the prime lending rate, which jumped a full percentage point in February alone. Also, owners of long-term interest-bearing investments such as bond mutual funds have seen the value of their principal eroded as higher rates have pushed bond prices lower. Holders of bank certificates of deposit, meanwhile, watch in frustration as the rates available on new CDs climb well above what they are getting on existing deposits that wo n't mature for another six months, a year or more. Still, long-term rates have risen much less than short-term rates in the past year or so. `` In periods such as 1988 when short-term interest rates rose while long-term interest rates remained stable, the household sector did very well,'' observed <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` This pattern has been modified but not eliminated by the rise in floating rate debt instruments -LRB- such as mortgages and home equity loans -RRB- in recent years.'' As savers and investors get more and more experience with the vagaries of interest-rate fluctuations, the people who create and sell financial products keep devising new approaches to the situation. The floating-rate CD, in various forms, is one prominent example in the banking world. A case in point among mutual funds is the Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust, an investment company sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. It is set up to seek a monthly yield that fluctuates pretty much in line with the prime rate, by investing in pieces of floating-rate bank loans known in the trade as `` loan participation interests.'' A possible drawback of this fund: a 3 percent sales charge up front and an early withdrawal penalty for the first year after purchase make it more suitable for long-term investors than for people who like to move their money around rapidly with changing trends in interest rates. In any case, the creation of investments like these keeps the high-interest-rate fan club growing all the time.

<TEXT>
 It's always been frustrating for the nation's governors, accustomed to being the bosses at home, to come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and wind up as high-profile lobbyists That was so even before the federal money ran out. But they keep coming, conferring, and urging their collective wisdom upon the White House and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where it usually gains a polite hearing and little more. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> gets VIP treatment, black tie receptions, audiences with the right people. But the message from those people has become a warning _ do n't look to the federal government for more aid to the states. Expect less because there's no money available here Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told the governors that they will have to find ways to finance some of the programs that face federal budget cuts because <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is `` fresh out of cash. Secretary of Transportation <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said state governments should anticipate increasing costs for the repair of dilapidated bridges, the reconstruction of highways and the like. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, politely chided the governors for wanting it both ways. `` You've got a number of policy statements here ... that call for increased federal spending ... and yet another one that calls for meaningful deficit reduction,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Actually, the governors could n't agree on a deficit reduction statement at the conference that wound up Tuesday, so they put it off until they meet next summer in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The association's task force on the federal budget was to have adopted a policy statement seeking freezes on military spending and on some domestic programs, but with full funding for welfare, child nutrition, Medicaid and similar programs. Those are programs state governments will have to finance if the flow of aid from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is cut or curbed. That proposal foundered on a dispute that mirrors the budget debate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the chairman, wanted to build in provision for a federal tax increase as a last resort. Republican Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the vice chairman, balked. So <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> stayed home and the governors dealt with less contentious matters, worrying all the while that the budget crunch, coupled with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise against new taxes, will wind up pushing costs and eventually tax increases upon state governments. They adjourned with no consensus on what to do about it. Gov. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the association chairman, said there must be investments in education, highways and other basic needs. `` Invest now or pay later,'' he said, although he did not say who should get the bills. The <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democrat did say that if there are federal budget freezes, the governors `` would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to protect the safety nets'' under programs for Americans in need. Presumably, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also would pay the costs. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, incoming head of the association, said that with the federal budget in trouble, the states are going to have to take the lead on many of the major problems facing the country. `` During the 1980s, a large measure of the responsibility for governing in this country has shifted from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> down to the states,'' said <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wanted it that way. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, former governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, came to the White House in 1981 calling for a `` new federalism'' that would make the states responsible for what had been federal programs. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> plan also was to return to states the revenue sources with which to pay for those programs. They got the first half. During the era of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget cuts, the governors adopted a resolution saying they could accept the reductions _ but also that they would vigorously oppose any attempt to shift the cost of the programs involved to state taxpayers. New administration, old debate. So, too, with the frustration level. When <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> was governor of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and chairman of the association, he said the governors should change their ways and operate as chief executives rather than trying to act like senators. `` There's certainly a weariness on my part at coming to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and trying to set federal policy,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, who now is president of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does n't do much good anyway.''

 A building falls on magician <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> during his latest special, but who's worried? The building collapse is the highlight of `` The Magic of <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> XI: The Explosive Encounter,'' a special airing on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> Friday. <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> is handcuffed and sealed inside a safe on the fourth floor of the White House Hotel in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The 13-story landmark, built in 1924, is to be demolished by means of strategically placed explosives and wire cables that will cause it to collapse inward. As a Mozart melody plays, the crew shuts <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> in the safe, sets the explosive timer and runs out of the building. The building collapses and moments later <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> appears from beneath a blanket on a steel plate. Magic or camera trickery? <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> was asked about suggestions that his spectacular TV feats, such as making the Statue of Liberty or a jet airplane disappear, are not true illusions but use camera tricks. `` That's not true,'' said <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> as he watched a tape of the building collapse on a monitor in an editing room. He had just arrived a few minutes before from <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, where he had been performing on stage. `` I think a lot of magicians are jealous. When I hear that, it's a compliment People ask me to, say, cure a headache. I say I'm only an illusionist. I always work in front of an audience. There were 40,000 people watching when the building came down. It was all done in one unedited camera shot. `` Besides, the network is very strict. They would never permit me to take advantage of the audience. There are people who are funnier than me, people who are better looking. If you could do it with a camera, they could use anybody.'' It is the 11th special <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> has done for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>. It features such new illusions as dancing ties and an origami box. His guest is <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Samms </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dynasty,'' who participates in a levitation illusion. `` I combine magic with a story and romantic music,'' he said. `` We use a lot of contemporary rock' n' roll, from the Pet Shop Boys to <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> to Sting. ... `` It's very important for me to keep my magic current. It's an art form that keeps growing. If more of us were doing it you'd see more transition in magic. Since I'm one of the few who gets exposure I feel a responsibility to guide magic into new areas.'' As he talked the monitor in the screening room showed his various illusions. He borrowed a necktie from a man in the audience and made it dance and drink milk through a straw while <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Belafonte </PERSON> sang `` Angelina.'' The illusion using origami, the Japanese art of folding paper into figures, begins with a small box penetrated by three swords. <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> pulls out the swords and unfolds the box until it becomes a large box. A woman then steps into it. <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> folds it until it is small again. He then re-inserts the swords. Finally, he opens the box again, and when the woman emerges she is wearing different clothing. `` <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Samms </PERSON> and anyone who appears on my show must sign a secrecy agreement,'' <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> said. `` Even when I build the equipment for my illusions, I give sections of it to different builders. Members of my crew have different tasks. I do have illusion designers, but I work out most of my own illusions. They may suggest a different way to do it.'' <PERSON> Copperfield </PERSON> said he also has a project in which magic is used as therapy in hospitals around the world. `` We teach magic to patients to help them regain dexterity,'' he said. `` For me for a long time magic was just a job. I was in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the illusion of walking through the Great Wall. Someone said, ` Look, you're doing what you want to do and here you are in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.' I slapped myself on the face and I've been enjoying magic ever since.''

<TEXT>
 An amazing turnabout in American attitudes toward consumer credit is presenting <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> with a monetary challenge that most of his predecessors did not face. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, has been tightening the money supply for nearly a year now, but consumers continue to buy up a storm, all but ignoring his efforts. At least part of the explanation lies in the fact that as <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> seeks to restrain the use of credit, the private sector is going all out to make it available. So comfortable are Americans with easy consumer credit these days, that a comparison with attitudes in the 1960s seems to span a century rather than just two decades. Back then, a personal loan at a commercial bank might have involved a long application form, an interview with a stone-faced loan officer and a wait of weeks while the bank's loan committee considered your credit-worthiness. Generally, the specific reason for seeking the money had to be stated. And if the reason given was `` bill consolidation'' some banks would insist on using the funds to make the payment themselves rather than trusting the applicant. Today, you need not ask for money. It is offered to you via credit cards by banks whose existence you had not known before and who obtaned your name from a purchased mailing list. `` You deserve a line of credit,'' they state. Should you accept the offer and maintain a record of on-time repayments you might hear from the bank again. `` We enjoy doing business with people like you who pay on time,'' they say. `` We are raising your credit limit.'' You need n't buy merchandise with your credit; you are free to ask for cash, and then to use at least some of it for regular living expenses. Money machines are placed so that your urge for credit can be indulged anywhere, anytime. If you remain a reluctant spender you are enticed with merchandise and prizes. Big banks today are in the retailing business, offering cardholders insurance, television sets, travel arrangements and more at a discount. The easy credit does n't apply only to small items. In the 1960s, the idea of offering discount credit to car buyers probably was n't even imagined Today it is routine. Let <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> do what he wants with interest rates, the sellers of automobiles will give you a rate considerably below that. In addition, they might offer you terms that really are easy. Some of them are pulling back from those terms in recent months, but there still are a lot of five-year car loans out there _ loans that might even outlast the car. In most of these transactions there is no harsh grilling, as there used to be. In fact, much of today's credit is offered, accepted and used without there ever being a personal encounter. It's all done by mail, and sometimes by phone. Even the house in which you live can be used as a line of credit, thanks to the home equity loan. As long as you have sufficient equity in your house, and the ability to repay, the money is forthcoming almost automatically. Well, you say, you could borrow on a house in the 1960s and long before that too. Of course, but back then it was done mainly out of need. You might even have pitied the pour soul who had to take out a second mortgage. Today, the use of the house as a bank is entrenched. It is considered smart to use your equity rather than letting it sit there idly. Your rich Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> makes sure you get the point by allowing you to borrow on the house tax-free, up to a point. These are some of the things you might consider when you try to understand how the American consumer continues to spend in spite of rising interest rates. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> considers them, which is n't to say that he and his colleagues on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> know how to deal with them.

Greetings in the corridors are returned with a not-so-nervous `` Hi,'' and he has somewhat relaxed the obsessive routines and rituals that govern an autistic life. `` I was worried because I had heard that they got worse as they got into adolescence and families had to decide what to do with them. With <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> just the opposite happened. He just seemed to improve,'' said <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, his mother. `` He's just a huge success story for parents with autistic kids who normally feel isolated, frustrated and believe ... it's a burden that will never let up,'' said <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s special education teacher. Years ago, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s first autistic student spoke only in the second-person and was prone to unpredictable rages that injured herself and others. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, her third autistic pupil, is the first savant and the only one to shine at the community vocational opportunities <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> arranges. `` I think he's trying to understand people's feelings,'' she said. `` It's a very rote process, a very mechanical process.'' Autism, absorption in self-centered, subjective mental activity, is a severe disorder present in four of 10,000 births, an overwhelming majority of them males. Its cause is unknown, but evidence suggests chemical or structural abnormalities in the brain. Among its characteristics is a profound disability in forming normal human attachments, or in showing or receiving affection. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> stiffens up when hugged, even by his parents, and wo n't let on if he's sick or in pain. A study by <PERSON> Ritvo </PERSON> and others published in February's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatry </ORGANIZATION> shows about two-thirds of those with autism have some degree of mental retardation, scoring below 70 on standardized IQ tests. Only about 10 percent of autistic people fall into the savant category, and far fewer of those are mentally retarded, other studies show. Mrs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> believes her son, who hoards bus schedules and loves to read the phone books he gets at Christmas, performs his calendar gymnastics by visual rather than mathematical means. `` I used to wonder if he was calculating dates, but I really believe it's a matter of having a photograph in his mind of our 100-year calendar. I asked him dates in the 1800s the other day and he could n't do it,'' she said. That's <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s explanation, too, elicited in what is typically a one-sided conversation with a stranger. He nervously checks his watch every few seconds. How do you figure out what day somebody was born? `` I have a good memory.'' What do you want to do after graduation? `` Have a job.'' Something with numbers? `` Yes.'' He's a whiz at simple math and his memory for numbers is as convenient as it is vast. `` He makes a great phone directory,'' says brother <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>. `` I think about anything he sees he's likely to remember,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who spent hours a few years ago making flash cards of multiplication tables, only to have <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> render them useless by memorizing the answers the first time through. <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, manager of <LOCATION> Video </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> in this <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb, accepted <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> for an hour a day's training on a two-week trial basis. He stayed for 1 -LCB- years, quickly memorizing the shelf code for every videocassette in the store and eventually mastering the computer to check in movies. `` He was amazing with numbers,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said. But it took him six months to routinely talk to other employees and much longer to pass time with customers. `` I used to stand by the door and say, ` <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, you ca n't leave until you say goodbye to everybody.' He would finally mumble goodbye.'' `` The emotional connection is the last to be made by an autistic child,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` It's so difficult to make people understand the excitement you feel when they finally start making that connection.'' An earlier stint shelving books at the school library gave <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> command of the Dewey Decimal System and friendship with the once-skeptical librarian. He was far less avid about custodial and landscaping jobs, and <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> believes absence of social interaction as much as numbers accounts for that today. `` He reaches out to people. His social habits are much more appropriate,'' she said, citing <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>'s response to the death of a school administrator's wife. As expected, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> affably recapitulated for the bereaved husband the obituary information from the newspaper. But then he added, `` I'm so sorry about your wife.''

<TEXT>
 Six years after <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged development of space-based defenses that could make atomic weapons obsolete, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is seeking to put his own imprint on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear doctrine. The new president, who has given his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> 90 days to come up with a plan, is expected to shift emphasis from Star Wars to the deployment of a new generation of mobile missiles. That is more than a cosmetic change, returning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doctrine to deterrence instead of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s radical vision of a world free of nuclear weapons. Senior administration officials have said in interviews with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not want to shift direction so radically as to derail Strategic Arms Reductions Talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The talks are too far along for that,'' said one top official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. Caution, consistency and coherence are emerging as the credo of the new administration, and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first defense budget will be closely scrutinized to see how he translates rhetoric into reality. In a speech last month, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered few details beyond asking that defense spending be kept even with the inflation rate, a 2 percent cut from the request <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sent <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> in January. But more is involved than moving money from one program to another to, in the president's words, `` insure that our capabilities and resources meet our commitments and strategies.'' National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, directing the nuclear doctrine review, has described <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nuclear policy as one of `` near total ... confusion.'' Scowcroft signaled where he is headed in a report that he drafted for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> before he joined the administration. The report suggested staggered development of weapons started under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, concentrating on the single-warhead Midgetman mobile missile rather than the 10-warhead MX or the B-2 stealth bomber. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> postponed until April a choice between the MX and the Midgetman, pending completion of the review. The chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chain </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, opposed the Midgetman in a Jan. 26 letter, saying, `` We ca n't afford it now.'' A congressional estimate in 1988 put the cost of the Midgetman at $ 13.8 billion, about three times the price of putting 50 MX missiles on mobile rail cars. Continuing all the weapons started by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would cost closer to $ 400 billion a year than the $ 308.8 billion requested by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration have dickered for a decade on whether to deploy a mobile missile, the Soviets have fielded two, the rail-mobile SS-24, with 10 warheads, and the road-mobile SS-25, with one. Mobile missiles help stabilize the nuclear balance because an enemy can never be certain where the missiles are, and they can be moved many miles in the 20 or so minutes that it takes a warhead to reach its target, according to Scowcroft and other strategic thinkers. That means neither superpower can be guaranteed victory in a surprise attack. Variations of that kind of deterrence have been at the heart of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear doctrine, a concept summed up in the acronym MAD _ the belief that a nuclear attack by either superpower on the other would result in Mutual Assured Destruction. `` We have for 40 years relied on the threat of nuclear weapons to keep the Soviet hordes at bay,'' Scowcroft wrote in a biting critique of the bargaining positions that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> staked out at the 1986 summit in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>. `` If we do have a strategic concept that brings order to all the disparate actions and proposals of the administration, of which <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> is a prime example, it would be reassuring to know what it is,'' <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> wrote. In a 1983 speech, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> argued that technological advances made it possible to defend against intercontinental ballistic missiles. That might allow the superpowers to eliminate their atomic arsenals, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, borrowing a line from the anti-nuclear movement. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vigorously pursued his call for a space-based missile defense and said a decision on deployment would come in the mid-1990s. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stopped short of that commitment, and said last month that he `` will vigorously pursue the Strategic Defense Initiative.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> report with which <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> was affiliated struck a similar note. `` Although active strategic defense is a long way from negating deterrence based upon mutual vulnerability, there is still an open question about the long-term advantages of large-scale ballistic missile and air defenses,'' it said. `` These systems might eventually be worth the price of deployment beyond the year 2000.'' Defense Secretary-designate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> has called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vision of a anti-nuclear umbrella unrealistic. And for several years, the scientists, engineers and military officers assigned to carry out <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s research, in the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, have aimed for a system to enhance deterrence by making some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> systems harder to destroy. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, who retired as head of SDIO on Feb. 1, argues that puts the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the same nuclear wavelength as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which he said never abandoned the doctrine of strategic defense and maintains an Anti-Ballistic Missile -LRB- ABM -RRB- defense system around <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, as allowed under the 1972 ABM treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no such system. The Soviets also maintain an extensive system of underground bunkers which the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> says are designed to protect the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership in wartime, and has `` hardened'' numerous military and industrial targets to help them survive a nuclear attack. `` The central political objective of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear policy is to deter aggression against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its primary allies' interests,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> CSIS </ORGANIZATION> By contrast, `` Soviet nuclear policy has as its primary objective the deterrence of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> first use -LRB- of nuclear weapons -RRB- during crisis of war.'' `` Unlike the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Soviet writings and statements made primarily by military professionals convey strong preemptive overtones,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CSIS </ORGANIZATION> report said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1983 speech gave the Soviets the impression that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was radically shifting its nuclear doctrine to a strategy of preemptive attack. Such a doctrine, bolstered by the technological superiority of the West, set off alarm bells in the Kremlin. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is sending signals that strategic defenses may be in the nation's future, but that for the time being, deterrence remains the bedrock of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear doctrine.

<HEAD>Soviets Review Nuclear Doctrine But Keep Bunkers to Protect Leaders</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-US Nuclear Doctrine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Buried deep beneath the village of <PERSON> Sharapova </PERSON> southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> are bunkers designed to allow <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders to survive a nuclear war. Contrast those shelters with statements by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that a nuclear war can not be won and should never be fought and you face the imponderable dilemma of the nuclear age: Why do the superpowers have atomic weapons and how will they use them? In the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> and at the White House, the superpowers are reviewing their own nuclear doctrines. National security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> is directing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort, one that is expected to change the defense budget, the shape of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal and American positions in arms control talks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet theories on the use of atomic weapons have evolved over the decades, from the construction of the first bombs in the 1940s until the widespread acceptance now that nuclear weapons are too dangerous to use in war. `` We are profoundly devoted to the idea of a nuclear-free world,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrote in `` Perestroika.'' `` If the huge stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and other weapons that have been accumulated are unleashed, nothI. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> enunciated the `` <LOCATION> Tula </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Doctrine </LOCATION>,'' which states that a nuclear can never be won and should never be fought. That doctrine has been adopted by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. But many <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officers, writing in theoretical journals and training manuals, argued otherwise, leading many Western analysts to conclude that Soviet war plans included a possible `` first strike'' against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And many believed at the time that the Soviets might use tactical nuclear weapons to try for an early victory during a war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a view that was buttressed by the deployment of medium-range Soviet SS-20s in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the late 1970s. The SS-20s are being destroyed under the <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> treaty, signed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in December 1987. The SS-20 deployment, which was criticized by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> journalists like <PERSON> Aleksandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Bovin </PERSON> and reformist scholars in civilian think-tanks, was part of a massive military build-up under <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, giving the Soviets parity with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in nuclear weapons, and near parity or superiority in conventional and naval forces. The Soviets now say they have adopted the `` new thinking'' of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and want to eliminate nuclear weapons by the end of the century. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the Soviets have made no move to dismantle their long-range nuclear forces or the bunkers where Kremlin leaders could hide in the event of war. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in its annual report, `` The Soviet Threat,'' that the first bunkers were built 40 years ago, and that `` yet another round of construction on these complexes began in the early 1980s, when Soviet leaders were publicly emphasizing that a nuclear war would be so catastrophic that attempts to achieve victory or even seriously limit damage in such a war no longer made sense.'' `` The bunkers are a manifestation of the old thinking,'' said one of the think-tank scholars who is backing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s campaign to trim the military. He asked that his name not be used because the bunkers are considered a state-secret. Yet, many American critics of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> are persuaded that the `` new thinking'' has taken hold in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbrunner </PERSON>, director of foreign policy studies at the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the bunkers are not evidence of a duplicitous Soviet nuclear doctrine. Rather, he said, they are similar in concept to the airplanes that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, waiting to whisk top leaders out of danger in the event of war. `` There are very good reasons to have those bunkers in order to stabilize your command,'' said <PERSON> Steinbrunner </PERSON>. `` If your central command can be eliminated by pre-emptive attack, you can be knocked out.'' Soviet leaders have claimed that they developed nuclear weapons in response to such bombs in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal. But the memoirs of Soviet physicists, published in the 1980s, give evidence that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> secretly sought to be the first to develop the bomb. Soviet work on the bomb began in the late 1930s. Through spies, the Soviet leadership learned in 1943 of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, and ordered physicists to speed up their work. After the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped an A-bomb on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> in 1945, the Soviets redoubled their efforts. `` Provide us with nuclear weapons in the shortest possible time. You know that <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> has shaken the whole world. The balance has been destroyed. Provide the bomb _ it will remove a great danger from us,'' <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> told the physicists. Four months later, the Soviets tested their first bomb, according to <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, a scholar at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and author of the book `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the Arms Race.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, nevertheless, retained a significant edge in the number of weapons and means to deliver them. Unable to afford the cost of maintaining a full land army in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> adopted the less expensive alternative of balancing Soviet military might with nuclear weapons. That remains the fundamental principle of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear doctrine in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Although the Red army occupied most of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after the defeat of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the American A-Bomb denied them superiority on the continent. During the Cold War, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet politicians and physicists engaged in a game of geo-political chess, maneuvering to place each other's cities, military bases and allies at nuclear risk. Through the'50s and'60s, the Soviets struggled to keep pace with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal, but were hamered because unlike the Americans, they did not have bases near their adversary on which to base bombers and missiles. The launching of the first man-made satellite, the Soviet sputnik in October 1957, signaled that the Russians had the means to build intercontinental ballistic missiles, and helped prompt <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> to warn of a `` missile gap'' during his successful presidential campaign in 1960. In 1962, <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> tried to put Soviet missiles within striking distance of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by deploying them in communist <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The Soviet failure in the missile crisis spurred them to achieve strategic parity with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Federal Farm Policy Needs Steady Hand at Wheel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> makes it plain that he intends running a tight ship through the stormy seas where trade barriers, drought, poverty and foreclosure lurk as monsters of the deep. But <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also says he is not ready to keelhaul farmers and the rest of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at the first sign of a budget knife. Some things are done simply because it's right to do so, within limits. `` We still have to have compassion for folks who get into economic difficulties in agriculture, often through no fault of their own _ weather conditions, for example, like last year's drought,'' he says `` And we will probably want to continue special privileges to help out young farmers so that they can gain entry in this business.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> had been asked to respond Feb. 24 at his first news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> since joining President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet. The question was whether he agreed with a report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which recommended, among other things, that cuts be made in federal subsidies for agricultural credit. Farming, the commission said, is a business and not a `` way of life'' that should include government props for those who ca n't make it on their own. `` I agree with the basic conclusion ... that farming is a business that ought to be handled in a business-like way by everyone, including the federal government, and that we ought not to be running long-term welfare-like programs in agriculture,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, however, we have to recognize that we can achieve that laudable objective only in a gradual way,'' he added, `` and only through cooperation of our trading partners.'' Thus, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> shifted into the mode that he knows intimately after 3 -LCB- years as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s trade representative. He led the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge against foreign barriers to free trade and still is a key player in the on-going <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. For many years, since a wheat-hungry <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> blew the lid off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain exports in the early 1970s, many economists, commodity groups, farmers and politicians have held doggedly to the idea that foreign markets offer the potential for prying American agriculture out of its old ruts and dependence on federal programs. One of the reason for federal subsidies is `` because our farmers and our marketers have to compete with subsidized products elsewhere in the world,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. If other countries agree to reduce their levels of subsidization, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can do likewise and eventually `` trade distorting subsidies'' can be eliminated. `` I put particular emphasis on the term ` trade distorting' because lots of people here and abroad have misquoted me as seeking to eliminate all agricultural subsidies, and I never said that,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said `` We can continue to provide income support to farmers as we deem appropriate, and I suspect that we will be doing so for a long period of time, simply because farming is a volatile business and it is going to be very difficult to reach a utopian situation where no assistance of any kind from the government level is required for American agriculture,'' he said. After his confirmation hearing on Feb. 2, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> provided the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with 147 pages of answers to questions that he and the panel did n't have time to cover during the formal proceeding. Those will be hauled out regularly as debate unfolds in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on various farm programs and proposed legislation. For example, Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> about the future of agriculture and where full-time commercial family farms are heading. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> replied that `` the economic structure of agriculture is likely to continue evolving much as it has in the past'' with fewer and larger farm units. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> then asked about the federal role. `` Federal policies should provide assistance and support to the farm sector in a structurally neutral manner,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` In other words, agricultural policies should be evaluated based upon their benefits and costs to the nation, but their implementation should not be slanted to favor one economic structure over another.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> added: `` Attempting to freeze a particular structure in place would inevitably reduce the efficiency of the sector over time. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> experience in agriculture is a classic example of this.'' The indications now show that `` a family farm structure will continue to dominate <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> agriculture, and I see no reason to tilt farm policies away from that,'' he said. <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON> also asked about <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> policies to help young and beginning farmers, and whether small and medium-sized farmers should be helped to start and stay in business. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said policies `` should assure there are no artificial barriers'' to prevent entry to farming but care should be observed. `` Helping these folks to start farming is one thing,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` Helping them to stay, no matter what kind of managers they are, is another. The latter can be enormously costly to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers. Successful farmers are not enthusiastic about paying more taxes in order to assist unsuccessful farmers to hang on.''

 <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON>'s role as a successful doctor helps create the positive black family image in <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` HeartBeat,'' and yet she's eager to range from the mainstream to do controversial material. She's one of the stars of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` The Women of <LOCATION> Brewster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION>,'' the story of a group of poor black women, which presents an unabashedly feminist view of the troubles they have with the men in their lives. The four-hour miniseries, which airs Sunday and Monday, is based on a novel by <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Naylor </PERSON> and also stars <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, Jackee, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lonette </PERSON> <PERSON> McKee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stickney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cicely </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>, <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON>. <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, as <PERSON> Mattie </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, is the central character, but the story of each woman is told. The film is interesting and well-made. But it is anti-male, and black men in particular take their lumps.

But I know for myself, I'm ready to reinforce other ideas about the family. I think it's a tragic flaw in black literature and drama that so much responsibility is put upon the artist to present images that are positive. It's unfair to dump all the responsibility onto the artist. `` On the other hand,'' she said. `` It's not fair that there are n't enough projects being done that cover a wide span of black life. So any one project done takes on so much responsibility to present good images of our race.'' She said now that she has begun writing she `` can assume responsibility for what I present.'' She has written a treatment for a romantic mystery movie, called `` Passant Blanc,'' set in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> in 1929, and a presentation for a situation comedy. <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON>'s role on `` HeartBeat'' as Dr. <PERSON> Cory </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> would seem to come naturally.

She was raised by her grandmother. `` The most important thing for her was what she never had, the solidity of a real home.

It's a classic case of our social-political system and how it works.''

 The government agency that safeguards bank deposits is in the hotel and restaurant business. It's the phantom landlord of several office towers, shopping centers, polo grounds, a sewage plant and a 78-acre thoroughbred horse farm. What does the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> know about changing bedsheets, flipping hotcakes, treating sludge or saddling horses? Nothing. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> inherited these properties after rescuing a spate of insolvent banks over the years, and it's now auctioning them off en masse to investors worldwide. Banking experts say the agency could be involved in many more of these auctions in the not-so-distant future if President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan for solving the nation's savings and loan crisis proceeds as planned. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposes to restructure the thrift regulatory system by giving the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> the added responsibility of insuring S & amp; Ls, currently the job of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The change would pass on to the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> the authority of handling repossessed thrift assets, including real estate. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION>, says it alone manages 2,400 <ORGANIZATION> FSLIC </ORGANIZATION> property assets in 33 states with an appraised value of $ 3.8 billion _ most the result of bad loans made by hundreds of failed thrifts over the years, half of which were in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. Among the properties: a 497-acre safari park in <LOCATION> Branson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. For now, though, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has its own white-elephant properties to contend with. About $ 84 million worth, or 20 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s current real estate portfolio, will be sold this Thursday in a venture with the auctioneer <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s and the real estate firm <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Wakefield </LOCATION>. The event marks the first large-scale real estate auction for the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> and only the second real estate auction for <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s, which is better known for pitching multimillion dollar art collections and rare jewels, not empty motels. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorentzen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s Division of Liquidations, said the agency previously had disposed of real estate holdings through smaller regional auctions or sealed bids sales He said the <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction exposes the select properties to a wider range of potential investors. On the block are 25 of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>'s largest properties, located in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where bank failures have been increasing. The auction targets range in value from a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> apartment complex worth around $ 650,000 to a 23-story office tower in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, worth around $ 24 million. A few had been owned directly by the problem banks while others were turned over to them as a result of loan defaults, <PERSON> Lorentzen </PERSON> said. When banks fail, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> steps in to protect the deposits, then tries to sell some or all of the assets to a healthy institution. Sometimes it ends up with properties it does n't want. A record 217 banks failed in 1988, up from 184 the previous year, with many of them victims of depressed economies in the agricultural and sunbelt regions. Some of the properties inherited by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> remain shut down, such as the 172-room Skyway Motel in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> received after local <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> failed on Feb. 14, 1986. Others remain open for business, like the 192-room <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s motel and restaurant in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, once the responsibility of City and <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which failed May 27, 1983. `` We do n't run them ourselves,'' <PERSON> Lorentzen </PERSON> said. `` We hire people to do that. `` Anything we have it's our goal to put it back in the private sector. Our main function is to insure deposits.'' The upcoming auction list includes about a dozen land parcels, three motels, two shopping centers, 10 apartment complexes and five office buildings. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiss </PERSON>, executive vice president for <PERSON> Cushman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wakefield </PERSON>, said that domestic response has been good so far but interest from foreign investors has n't been as strong. Among the more unusual items: _ T & amp; J Stables, based in <LOCATION> Stevinson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a 78-acre thoroughbred horse boarding, breeding and training facility Horses not included. Valued at between $ 575,000 and $ 775,000. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Retama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and adjacent tract, located on 596 acres in <LOCATION> Selma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> The parcel includes 16 polo fields, a 3,776-seat grandstand, horse stables, a veterinarian's clinic and apartments. Valued at between $ 7.5 million and $ 10.5 million. _ The 23-story <ORGANIZATION> Riverview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, one of the biggest buildings in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. Valued at between $ 20 million and $ 24 _ <ORGANIZATION> Sarasota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a water and waste-water treatment plant in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, valued at between $ 900,000 and $ 1.3 million

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> was in a coma when she gave birth to a healthy eight-pound son in December. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> remains in a coma after her husband won the right to abort her 18-week-old fetus in February. The number of pregnant women who go into a coma each year is small, doctors say, and many questions remain about how a pregnant woman's coma affects the fetus and how a fetus affects the recovery of its comatose mother. That's why <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>'s birth was so unique _ and why <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> fought for an abortion, hoping to improve his wife's chances of recovery There are no accurate statistics, but three large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trauma centers report a total of about 20 cases of pregnant women in comas over two years. Doctors at all three hospitals agreed that in most cases the coma ends and the woman goes home and has a healthy baby. With severe head injuries most fetuses abort naturally, are aborted to help the mother, or die in childbirth. `` There is a very high incidence of spontaneous abortion that occurs in these cases,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Case </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and director of neurosurgery at <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, one of the largest trauma centers. `` Out of this group they either spontaneously abort or after a few weeks they go home to deliver.'' In perhaps one comatose patient a year is a birth even attempted, and <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he could not remember such a birth ever being successful at the hospital. The mother often begins to `` unravel medically,'' forcing doctors to try for a premature birth, he said. `` There is not a lot of research in this.'' Doctors at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodget </PERSON>'s birth was only the fourth successful delivery from a comatose mother they could document in medical history Dr. <PERSON> Madhura </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, who specializes in treating head injuries to pregnant women, has seen only seven such cases in two years. Several patients recovered with fetuses intact but in one case of an unmarried teen-ager who was five weeks pregnant, the girl's father ordered an abortion because his daughter was unlikely ever to be able to care for an infant. `` The mother subsequently woke up from the coma but continues to be impaired. She has no memory of the fact of ever being pregnant.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, suffered brain stem injury in a traffic accident June 30, when she was three months pregnant. After initial reluctance, family members say, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> hospital accepted her. Doctors held out little hope of improvement, but shortly after <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s Dec. 9 birth, she began regaining consciousness and was well enough to return home in mid-January. She has made steady progress and has limited use of one arm, allowing her to cradle her newborn and point to letters to spell words. Last week she began intensive rehabilitation at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elizabeth </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION>, and, in a unique challenge, has vowed to walk and talk before her newborn. No one knows exactly why <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> came around after the birth, although one doctor speculated that hormonal changes triggered a return to consciousness. Family members feel she was conserving her energy for the fetus. `` After she had the baby, it was a signal for her to go,'' husband <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said. `` After she had the baby she concentrated more on herself.'' The family `` never had a lot of hope from any doctor,'' <PERSON> Blodgett </PERSON> said, but always had faith she would recover. `` We spent so much time with her that you could see the small things she did.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> had no such hopes. He successfully battled anti-abortion activists to win a court order allowing the abortion, which doctors said could aid his wife's recovery. Mrs. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, 32, remains in a coma at <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> threatens <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dominance in finance just as it has in cars and computer chips, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> says. The threat of competition from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the driving force behind the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to institute 24-hour, worldwide electronic trading through its <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> system, <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> said at a conference Tuesday. `` The Japanese are something that no one ignores in the world of industry or finance,'' he said in an interview. The Japanese, who once scorned innovative U.S.-invented securities products such as stock-index futures, have begun electronic trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> of stock and yen bond futures and soon will begin trading yen currency futures in competition with <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The desire to keep business executed through <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was behind the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s development of <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The system, in which investments are traded on a computer screen, is scheduled to begin in October. An Australian exchange and the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, which handles oil futures, have said they also will list contracts on <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>. `` Innovation of this type is essential if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is to maintain its leading competitive edge and remain a leading provider of financial services to the world community,'' <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said when the federal agency approved <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 2. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, has called <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> `` the wave of the future.'' The race to round-the-clock trading, faster computers and instantaneous global communication poses a challenge to regulators such as the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> as well as to an older generation of traders. One eventual victim of modernization could be the local traders on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, some of whom are being investigated for allegedly cheating their customers. Some outsiders have predicted that <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> will undermine the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s chaotic but time-honored `` open outcry'' trading system. <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON> denied that Tuesday, saying face-to-face trading in the pits has advantages over faceless electronic trading, which will be prohibited during the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s regular hours. `` Why are we here today in a room when we could all be on speaker phones in our offices?'' he asked at the conference. <PERSON> Brodsky </PERSON>'s comments came on the second and final day of a conference on technology and the financial markets sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Annenberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. In another session, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Summers </PERSON> spelled out a proposal for a tax on stock trading to discourage socially wasteful market speculation. A half-percent tax could raise $ 10 billion a year without doing any damage to the stock market's basic functions, said <PERSON> Summers </PERSON>, who was the chief economic adviser to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the losing Democratic presidential candidate. Summers was disputed by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Margolis </PERSON>, a managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and by <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> economist. <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> said it was unfair to single out the securities industry for a tax.

<HEAD>Trump Shuttle Takeover Clouded By Eastern Labor Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Billionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> sums up his philosophy as `` Never think of the negative. All obstacles can be overcome.'' But there are some things that even the seemingly invincible <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who plans to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' three-city shuttle service, ca n't control. The bitter, escalating labor dispute at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, as well as pending litigation by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions against the shuttle sale, have thrown a monkey wrench into <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s planned debut in the airline business. The 2-year rivalry between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the lucrative <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> shuttle business is expected to intensify when the flamboyant <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> completes his $ 365 million purchase of the Eastern shuttle. Despite the gathering storm clouds at Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials say they hope to close the deal sometime this month. And the heads of both shuttles say they're gearing up for fierce competition waged on the battleground of service. The two hourly shuttle services, used mainly by business travelers, link <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. For both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, they are profitable units in an otherwise bleak financial landscape. But <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s takeover has been complicated by the strife at Eastern. As a Friday strike deadline set by the airline's <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union approaches, hope is fading for a last-minute settlement of the 16-month contract dispute. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recommended that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declare a presidential emergency _ a move that would at least delay the walkout for 60 days. Observers speculate that if there is a strike, employees of the Trump Shuttle _ all of whom are currently with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> _ could walk out in sympathy with their former peers after the close of the shuttle deal, planned for sometime in March. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION>, said his company has recognized the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> unions as valid bargaining representatives for <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s team plans to negotiate separate agreements with those employees sometime before or after the sale is completed, he said in an interview. If there is a strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, `` We do n't know what the impact on us would be,'' said <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON>, the former president of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s rival shuttle. The uncertainty created by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s labor situation, along with union litigation contesting the sale of the shuttle to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, could even force <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to sell the service to the developer at a lower price, one analyst suggests. `` Eastern is so hungry for cash,'' said <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupersmith </PERSON>, a financial consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> who works for <ORGANIZATION> Touche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He said that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, the chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, needs cash `` desperately'' and might knock $ 25 million to $ 50 million off last October's agreed purchase price of $ 365 million. But <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> and some analysts dismiss that idea as mere conjecture. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> may bargain for labor peace by offering his shuttle employees higher wages than what <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is willing to pay, suggested <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, an airline analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> calls speculation, however, the notion that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> is `` backing away'' from the shuttle acquisition If and when <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> completes the deal, observers agree that the shuttle showdown between the real estate tycoon and <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> will hinge on service, not fares. `` It will be a highly competitive environment between the two -LRB- shuttles -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karos </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's going to be a service battle.'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has said he plans to spend `` tremendous amounts of money'' to upgrade the Eastern shuttle, whose fleet of aging, blue-and-silver <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned with red, black and gold stripes as well as <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s name on their tails. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>, chief operating officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shuttle </ORGANIZATION>, said his team will continue to add services geared toward the business traveler that he concedes could be matched by <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> recently launched an advertising blitz calling its shuttle `` The Corporate Jet'' and emphasizing services such as inflight telephones. The average shuttle passenger takes 10 round trips a year on the service and earns $ 115,000 annually, according to Eastern. The one-way weekday fare is $ 99. `` The -LRB- shuttle -RRB- market basically is pretty price-insensitive,'' <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said.

 Premier, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabicso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` smokeless'' cigarette, was dead on arrival because of its unpleasant taste, industry analysts said. But they predicted the failure wo n't forestall other cigarette innovations designed to counter complaints about smoke `` Everyone I know who tried it thought it was really horrible,'' said <PERSON> Pavlos </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandrakis </PERSON>, who follows tobacco companies for <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s cigarette subsidiary, announced Tuesday that it was withdrawing Premier from the market after five months of testing in two states. `` While smokers are very interested in the concept, the current product has not achieved adequate consumer acceptance,'' the company said in a statement from its <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, headquarters. `` This is no surprise,'' said industry analyst <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. `` It was brought out stillborn.'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Premier suffered from two fatal problems: unacceptable taste and aroma. `` What the company was saying was consumers will get used to it, they'll give it an extra try,'' he said. `` That's inconsistent with the fact that we are a nation of channel-hoppers, and if you do n't like it the first time, you're not going to try it a second time. Smokers also found Premier hard to keep lit, and were n't sure what to do with the cigarettes when they were finished since Premiers do n't burn down like ordinary butts, said analyst <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I thought the project initially was revolutionary in concept,'' he said. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was very bold. But the technology was n't there yet to satisfy consumer requirements.'' Premier differed from ordinary cigarettes in that it did n't actually burn tobacco Instead, smokers lit a carbon heat source at the tip. During inhalation, hot air passed passed over an aluminum-encased flavor capsule and dried tobacco. Despite its innovations, Premier did n't eliminate health concerns. Several health organizations, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, last year asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Admininstration </ORGANIZATION> to ban sales of the cigarette. Several analysts speculated that the timing of Premier's demise was due to the buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> earlier in February by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm needs to cut costs at <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> to pay off the debt it took on in the record $ 24.53 billion takeover. But others said Premier was doomed no matter what. `` I think the consumer reaction was so negative that it pretty much was a foregone conclusion,'' <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> did not make the decision to drop Premier, said <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Annese </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. It was a decision by the tobacco company's management, she said, `` and they just agreed with us.'' <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> spent about $ 200 million developing Premier, and an additional $ 125 million to launch the product in the test markets. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> had said it expected it would cost $ 1 billion to roll out Premier nationwide. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said it had no plans to reintroduce Premier or a similar product `` unless we have fully addressed the issues raised in the test markets.'' Ms. <PERSON> Annese </PERSON> said research on Premier led to much spinoff technology, including some aspects of two brands recently put in test markets, Vantage Excel and <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION>. Vantage Excel has a new tobacco blend and special, high-porosity paper that give off less lit-end smoke than ordinary cigarettes. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> has a distinctive aroma that is being marketed as being less objectionable to non-smokers. `` We have learned an awful lot that will be helpful,'' Ms. <PERSON> Annese </PERSON> said. `` We do not consider this to be a failure.'' Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> and other tobacco companies have other projects in the works to reduce the smoke cigarettes emit _ the primary cause of smoking restrictions and complaints from non-smokers. <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON> said some companies are looking at a change in the way tobacco is packed into cigarette casings. <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said the biggest innovation may come from biotechnology, which may provide new strains of tobacco lacking many of its undesirable characteristics. `` The 1990s are likely to be a period of technological breakthroughs -LRB- in cigarettes -RRB-, providing you do n't have an advertising ban,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. He said a ban on cigarettes advertising would prevent companies from successfully launching new products.

<HEAD>Study Says Gay Men Are `Dream' Consumers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Madison Avenue ad agencies long have ignored the gay community in their marketing plans, but a new nationwide study portrays homosexuals as dream consumers. The report by <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, commissioned by a marketing firm that represents 125 gay publications, found gay men in general have higher than average incomes, higher education levels, fewer dependents and a large amount of discretionary income that can be spent on luxury goods. `` The survey basically validates what we've known all along, and puts quantitative figures on it,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, president of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Rivendell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which paid for the survey. `` The gay market is economically a dream market.'' The report questioned 4,000 readers, mostly male, of gay newspapers in eight of the nation's top urban markets. It asked them about their lifestyle and spending habits, including buying patterns in travel, liquor, electronic equipment and apparel. <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON>, who says marketing companies have largely ignored the possibility of targeting gay consumers, said Monday he plans to use the survey's findings to urge national advertisers to place their messages in more gay publications. The Simmons survey, completed in October and released this week by <PERSON> Rivedell </PERSON>, found gay men had an average annual income of $ 36,800, more than triple the national average of $ 12,287 as reported in March 1988 Census figures. It also found the annual income of a gay household was $ 55,400, compared with a national average of $ 36,500. Sixty percent of gay men are college graduates, compared with the average of 18 percent for consumers in general. About 35 percent of homosexuals also have some type of post-graduate education. Forty-nine percent of gay men hold `` professional or managerial'' posts, compared with about 16 percent of the population at large. While gay men are 50 percent less likely than the population at large to own their primary residence, they are twice as likely to own vacation homes. Gay men also are twice as likely to travel than those in the general consumer market, and seven times more likely to go to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> than the rest of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said the buying habits of lesbians are not as easy to calculate because of the relatively few major publications expressly addressed to them. `` We have been selling the legend of -LRB- gay -RRB- high income, high education, the low number of dependents, and the large amount of discretionary and disposable income spent on high-ticket items _ like travel and imported alcohol,'' <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabato </PERSON> said. `` But other than the legend, there was very little to back it up.'' <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibato </PERSON> said the few national companies that have tried targeting gay consumers have been rewarded. `` <PERSON> Remy </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> -LRB- cognac -RRB- has done ad campaigns -LRB- in the gay press -RRB- six weeks prior to Christmas, and in June, prior to Gay Pride Week -LRB- nationwide -RRB-, and it has paid off for them,'' <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Sibato </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Trade Journal Says Sprint To Buy Stake In Trans-Atlantic Cable</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is expected to sign an agreement to buy a major stake in a trans-Atlantic cable that could boost its international telecommunications business, a trade publication said this week. The trade journal, TelecommunicationsWeek, said an agreement would be signed early this month under which <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> would acquire <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transatlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecommunications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> McLean </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The trade journal did not disclose the financial terms of the proposed acquisition. Private Transatlantic is installing a trans-Atlantic fiber optic cable in a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wireless </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a long-distance company. Each company owns half of the venture. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, declined to comment on the report. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint is the country's third-largest long-distance telephone company. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Wireless in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said his company had been talking with several big companies about selling a stake. He declined to identify the companies. About half of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>'s overseas calls are transmitted on a trans-Atlantic analog, or copper wire, cable. The rest are transmitted by satellite. Fiber optic cables transmit calls digitally by using impulses of light. Analog transmission, an older technology, is more subject to distortion. Analysts said that in addition to using the new cable system for its own calls, <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint could lease transmission services to other long-distance companies. `` If the deal is completed as rumored, it would be a very positive event for <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, an analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Not only would it make the company money, but it would give them much better access within the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, which is important, because international long-distance telephone service is growing about 24 percent a year, more than double the domestic rate,'' <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said.

 A partnership between <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> could give the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> an edge in the global race to dominate the high-definition television market, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman says. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T announced Tuesday they were joining forces on a $ 24 million effort to develop a processor-receiver and other hardware needed to bring high-definition TV, which produces clearer, brighter pictures, to the mass market. Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 21.5 million program to develop picture tubes for high-definition TV sets. <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said the successful completion of the two projects would yield `` real winning American technology ... that will allow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to leapfrog the Japanese and Europeans'' in the mass-market development of high-definition TV. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, based in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T said they would spend $ 11 million and were seeking a $ 13 million federal grant from the government to finance the research-and-development project.

Last month, 16 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronics companies said they were considering banding together to compete in the high-definition TV market, but they have not yet announced such an agreement. The Pentagon has indicated it wants to help finance the development of high-definition television because of its potential military applications, and is seeking grant proposals. By combining <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s integrated-circuit technology with <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s television expertise, the companies hope to develop equipment for evaluating and demonstrating <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s prototype high-definition TV transmission system The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> high-definition television transmission standard prescribes 1,125 horizontal lines per screen, more than twice as many as the 525 lines per screen on today's televisions, permitting superior pictures. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> also announced a $ 21.5 million program to develop large-screen versions of its `` flat tension mask'' high-resolution picture tubes for military and consumer high-definition TV displays. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the company has used the tubes, which currently measure 14 inches diagonally, in its computers for the last two years. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, the only major U.S.-owned producer of television sets and picture tubes, said it was seeking $ 10 million from the government to complement its $ 11.5 million commitment to the picture-tube research program.

<HEAD>New Ad Study Puts Average Ad Production Cost at $145,600</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The average original television commercial aired in 1987 cost $ 145,600 to produce, according to a benchmark study by an advertising agency group. The backers of the study say the methods developed for its report will give the ad industry a recognized standard against which it can measure from year to year what is driving commercial production costs. In the past, advertiser, agency and media groups often have come up with widely differing estimates of production costs. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agencies </ORGANIZATION> said its latest report was based on a computerized study of production costs for 2,042 commercials submitted by 22 ad agencies. The average production cost is 27.8 percent more than the $ 113,940 average that the same group reported 1986, although people involved with both surveys said no comparisons between the reports should be drawn because of the changes in how the latest data were compiled. They said the new report also should give advertisers more comparative information than they have ever had on how their commercial production costs compare with the average for companies in the same business or doing the same types of ads. It found, for instance, that commercials for fast food, snacks, beer and soft drinks were on average nearly twice as expensive to make as ads for toys and recreation, $ 229,800 compared with $ 117,500. Commercials produced for national advertisers averaged $ 156,600 to produce, while those for regional advertisers averaged $ 102,000 and local ads cost an average of $ 56,900, the study said. The report said commercials that featured interviews or testimonials were the cheapest to produce, at an average cost of $ 76,300, while those using song and dance productions were the most expensive, at $ 277,700. Commercials using special effects averged about $ 188,000, those with animation cost $ 113,400 and those featuring a simple shot of a product while an unseen narrator spoke cost $ 101,900. The average industrywide production company costs were $ 97,400 per commercial, accounting for the bulk of the total costs, the survey said. The rest of the costs came from items such as performing talent, editorial and post-production work, music and travel for the admakers. `` The big news here is that we finally have a way from 1987 on to use the same critieria in measuring commercial costs,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON>, the Lintas: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ad agency executive who headed the study team. Over the past few years, several trade groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertisers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION>, have attempted to estimate average production costs, but the results have varied widely. The advertiser group, for instance, estimated production costs averaged $ 124,930 in 1985, but the television bureau said its survey showed costs averaged less than 40 percent of that amount. Even the figures that the ad agency group came up with in recent years are no longer comparable with the latest survey findings, <PERSON> Bragg </PERSON> said. `` We are using an entirely different data base and different criteria for gathering information,'' he said. He said the 1986 study included information from a number of smaller agencies that were not included this year. But he said he expects to have figures for 1988 ads that are comparable to the 1987 figures by mid-summer.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar today firmed against the Japanese yen, while share prices declined for the third consecutive day. The dollar, following a 1.15-yen surge Tuesday, gained another 0.53 yen and closed at 127.68 yen. It opened at 126.97 yen, the day's low, and rose to 127.81 yen at one point. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 300.17-point loser Tuesday, shed another 21.30 points, or 0.067 percent, closing at 31,964.30. The average has lost a total of 488.19 points, or 1.51 percent, this week after closing at a record high for the second consecutive day last Thursday. Friday was a public holiday for Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s funeral. Stock traders said buying incentives were strong at the start of today's trading following Tuesday's plunge in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and an 8.03-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But investors began selling to take profits after prices rose across the board in the morning session, and the Nikkei went back down, they said. `` There was a widely shared feeling in the market that most shares are overpriced and they had to fall sooner or later,'' said one dealer at a major securities company. `` So investors are anxious to take profits when share prices gain and sell when they decline.'' Currency dealers said the dollar was strong because of increased demand at the start of the new month. The manager of a commercial bank said the dollar was oversold in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight after the second revision of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fourth quarter gross national product growth figures. `` The dollar was oversold, and people are buying it back,'' he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is drafting regulations that would require banks and savings and loan associations to get its approval before seeking so-called brokered deposits in their efforts to expand. Many experts have contended that the deposits put together by brokers in $ 100,000 blocks _ the maximum insured by the government _ at above-market interest rates and then loaned out for high-risk ventures such as shopping centers caused some S & amp; Ls to sink into insolvency as the loans went bad. <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that the regulations would be proposed `` very shortly.'' Agency officials said the regulation initially would apply only to the 8,000 banks that the agency supervises until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completes legislation proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that would put <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls under <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> jurisdiction. But <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said it would apply to S & amp; Ls then as well. And officials said that they expect <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to act on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s S & amp; L bailout package well before the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> can issue the new brokered deposit regulations in their final form Under the proposal, any bank or savings institution seeking to increase its loan portfolio by more than 36 percent a year through the use of brokered deposits or any other means would have to get prior approval from the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, officials said. For the past two years, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has been requiring banks to submit quarterly reports on their brokered deposits. But regulators said that is an after-the-fact reporting requirement only. The new regulation, they said, would give the agency pre-emptive authority to stop a bank or S & amp; L from seeking such deposits if officials believed they were going to be used to finance overly risky ventures. `` They would n't be allowed to grow by using -LRB- high deposit -RRB- rates like that unless they could show they had a good use for the money,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said after the committee hearing. In the three weeks since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his S & amp; L bailout plan and the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has taken supervision over 36 insolvent savings institutions, the agency already has stopped one of them in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> from seeking more brokered deposits, an official said. After <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> deregulated S & amp; Ls in the early 1980s, many of them _ particularly in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with their more lenient banking laws _ grew several-fold in size through the use of brokered deposits. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, in testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week, had defended the use of brokered deposits, saying they provided many <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls with liquidity that they otherwise would n't have had. But <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> acknowledged that the high-interest deposits had created a spiraling effect that contributed to the current S & amp; L crisis, and he said he felt `` uncomfortable'' about them in some instances.

 Many states are doing too little to tackle major environmental issues including solid waste disposal, water quality and protection of food supplies, according to an environmental group that conducted a national survey. <LOCATION> Renew </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a private environmental and conservation organization, gave top ranking Tuesday to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> among the 50 states, with <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> at the bottom of the list. But the group, whose survey examined state efforts to deal with five environmental problem areas, said that overall there still is too little bele environmental problems on the state level. Aggressive state initiatives to protect the environment remain `` the exception and not the rule,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridley </PERSON>, who directed the survey. In many cases, states are forced to make haing done to tackrd budget decisions with environmental protection losing out, added <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, the group's executive director. In other cases a state excelled in one area that was examined, but fared poorly in others. For example, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was given the highest mark for dealing with water quality issues but was ranked well below average in forest and land management and average in protecting food quality. While <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> was second only to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the overall ranking, in -RRB-; drinking water quality -LRB- <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> -RRB-; food safety -LRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -RRB-; dealing with growth -LRB- <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> -RRB-. The survey ranked the states numerically, with 50 being the highest possible when examining state actions undertaken to deal with the five areas examined. In the overall ranking, which took into account state efforts in all five areas, the top states were: <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -LRB- 42 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> -LRB- 39 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> -LRB- 38 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> -LRB- 37 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> -LRB- 37 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> -LRB- 34 -RRB-, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> -LRB- 34 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -LRB- 32 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> -LRB- 32 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> -LRB- 30 -RRB-, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -LRB- 30 -RRB-. The states with the lowest ranking were: <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> -LRB- 10 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> -LRB- 11 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> -LRB- 12 -RRB-, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> -LRB- 13 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> -LRB- 13 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> -LRB- 14 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> -LRB- 15 -RRB-, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> -LRB- 15 -RRB-, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> -LRB- 15 -RRB-, and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> -LRB- 15 -RRB-. The report said the states with the best overall program aimed at protecting drinking water were <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. The states with the worst record were <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. The study said there continue to be `` substantial gaps'' in the monitoring of harmful chemicals in foods, although `` some states have taken on a growing responsibility to protect food supplies,'' especially in monitoring for pesticide residues. It said the five states with the best programs for food safety were <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. The states with the worst programs were <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. The report cited increasing concerns about the growing garbage problem, but noted that only eight states so far have comprehensive recycling programs and only 10 have laws requiring at least some recycling of waste products. The states given the best marks for dealing with solid waste disposal issues were <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Those with the lowest marks were <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. The study said <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> had the best programs for dealing with the impact of growth. States with the poorest programs were <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. The report said only seven states have enacted laws that attempt to protect forests by balancing the needs of timber producers and conservationists. It said the six states with the best forest management programs were <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>.

 Here is a ranking of the 50 states on their efforts to deal with five environmental concerns, according to a report released Tuesday by <ORGANIZATION> Renew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a private environmental and conservation group. The ranking is based on a total numerical figure covering the five categories, with 50 being the highest possible total. The first figure after each state represents the state's overall score. The five figures in parenthesis reflect how the states scored in each of the five categories examined with a top score of 10 possible in each category -RRB- Those categories, in order, are forest management, solid waste recycling, protection of drinking water, food safety, and control of growth to protect the environment. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> 42 -LRB- 9, 7, 8, 9, 9 -RRB- <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> 39 -LRB- 9, 10, 5, 5, 10 -RRB- <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> 38 -LRB- 8, 8, 6, 8, 8 -RRB- <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> 37 -LRB- 8, 7, 9, 5, 8 -RRB- <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> 37 -LRB- 6, 8, 7, 8, 8 -RRB- <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> 34 -LRB- 3, 8, 7, 10, 6 -RRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> 34 -LRB- 5, 8 9, 4, 8 -RRB- <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> 32 -LRB- 6, 8, 4, 6, 8 -RRB- <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> 32 -LRB- 7, 6, 6, 6, 7 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> 30 -LRB- 3, 9, 6, 5, 7 -RRB- <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 30 -LRB- 10, 5, 3, 6, 6 -RRB- <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> 29 -LRB- 3, 5, 10, 4, 7 -RRB- <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> 29 -LRB- 5, 3, 8, 6, 7 -RRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> 28 -LRB- 4, 8, 3, 5, 8 -RRB- <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> 28 -LRB- 6, 8, 3, 4, 7 -RRB- <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> 28 -LRB- 5, 8, 4, 4, 7 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> 28 -LRB- 6, 4, 7, 6, 5 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 27 </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- 5, 4, 5, 7, 6 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> 27 -LRB- 5, 8, 4, 4, 6 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Vermont </ORGANIZATION> 27 -LRB- 4, 7, 5, 4, 7 -RRB- <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> 26 -LRB- 4, 6, 5, 5, 6 -RRB- <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> 25 -LRB- 9, 3, 5, 5, 3 -RRB- Missouri 25 -LRB- 6, 5,5, 5, 4 -RRB- <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> 24 -LRB- 5, 6, 2, 5, 6 -RRB- <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> 24 -LRB- 5, 1, 6, 8, 4 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> 22 -LRB- 5, 3, 5, 4, 5 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> 22 -LRB- 4, 4, 4, 5, 5 -RRB- <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> 22 -LRB- 6, 2, 5, 4, 5 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> 22 -LRB- 5, 4, 3, 5, 5 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> 21 -LRB- 3, 3, 4, 7, 4 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> 20 -LRB- 3, 1, 6, 6, 4 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> 20 -LRB- 4, 3, 5, 5, 3 -RRB- <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> 20 -LRB- 3, 4, 5, 5, 3 -RRB- <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> 19 -LRB- 3, 2, 4, 6, 4 -RRB- <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> 18 -LRB- 5, 2, 3, 6, 2 -RRB- <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> 17 -LRB- 3, 3, 3, 5, 3 -RRB- <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> 17 -LRB- 2, 3, 5, 4, 3 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> 16 -LRB- 4, 2, 2, 6, 2 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 16 </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- 4, 1, 4, 6, 1 -RRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> 16 -LRB- 4, 3, 2, 4, 3 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> 15 -LRB- 6, 2, 2, 2, 3 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> 15 -LRB- 3, 3, 2, 4, 3 -RRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> 15 -LRB- 3, 3, 6, 2, 1 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> 15 -LRB- 3, 4, 3, 3, 2 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> 14 -LRB- 5, 4, 1, 1, 3 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> 13 -LRB- 3, 2, 1, 6, 1 -RRB- <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> 13 -LRB- 3, 2, 2, 4, 2 -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> 12 -LRB- 2, 2, 2, 3, 3 -RRB- <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> 11 -LRB- 2, 2, 1, 4, 2 -RRB- <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> 10 -LRB- 2, 2, 1, 3, 2 -RRB-

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' Machinists union says it will disrupt air, sea and ground transportation nationwide if it goes on strike against the airline Saturday, and <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> officials pledged the support of their 14 million members. As part of a strike, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union officials said they also would picket outside <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s sister carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, plus other airlines, ships and transportation services covered by the federal Railway Labor Act. `` We're talking about a total disruption of transportation in this country,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortis </PERSON>, Machinists Local 702 vice president. Machinists leaders have been authorized by their 8,500 members to call a strike after midnight Friday, which marks the end of a 30-day cooling-off period set by federal mediators. Ortis and <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> strike organizer <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> helped lead a rally and news conference Tuesday in which dozens of local unions were represented. `` We will urge our 14 million members not to cross any picket lines,'' <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> said. `` It means that those members would probably not fly on Eastern or Continental. Secondarily, they would be out to rallies, they would be out to strike sites, they would be out to financally support the Machinists.'' Eastern officials have expressed doubt the Machinists can legally or practically spur a nationwide action. Eastern, which says it is losing more than $ 1 million a day, wants $ 150 million in wage concessions from the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, who represent mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground services workers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which entered the 17-month-old contract dispute in January 1988, has asked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to appoint an emergency panel that could delay a strike 60 days. Eastern says it ca n't afford the delay, but the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> and Machinists support the emergency panel. Separately, the Machinists filed court papers denying the company's complaint to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> that the union was violating <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>' injunction against a work slowdown. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> scheduled a hearing for today. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union said Tuesday it was continuing talks with management on a new contract covering job security and other issues. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> leaders have urged their 3,500 Eastern members to honor Machinists picket lines. However, pilots union members indicated last week they might cross picket lines if Eastern granted contract concessions. Pilots generally are considered the most crucial and hardest-to-replace airline employees in a strike. Eastern has declined to comment on negotiations this week.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit widened to 2.09 billion pounds, or $ 3.63 billion, in January from a revised deficit of 1.76 billion pounds in December, the government said Wednesday. January's trade gap compared with a deficit of 1.45 billion pounds in January 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. The financial markets had been expecting a deficit of about 1.85 million pounds and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> moved quickly to say they `` should n't put too much emphasis'' on the figures. Monthly trade figures can be `` very erratic'' and `` among the last indicators to respond to a tightening of monetary policy,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. The pound fell slightly on the news, from $ 1.7350 to $ 1.7300. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, trade spokesman for the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the figures show `` <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is now an economy which can not pay its way and which is falling further and further behind in the competitive race.'' The figures showed exports totaled a record 7.37 billion pounds in January, up from 6.9 billion pounds in December and up from 6.4 billion pounds in January 1988. Imports totalled a record 9.47 billion pounds in January, up from 8.66 billion pounds in December and up from 7.8 billion pounds in January 1988. The December merchandise trade deficit was previously reported as 1.66 billion pounds. The government said the upward revision in the December figures was due mainly to a revision in the seasonal adjustments for 1988. With January's trade in invisible items, which covers services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer payments, estimated to be in surplus by 400 million pounds <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s current account showed a deficit of 1.69 billion pounds, compared with a revised deficit of 1.36 billion pounds in December.

 Share prices were stronger around midday Wednesday, as the market largely shrugged off government figures showing a sharp widening in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit. Share prices fell back momentarily after the release of the January trade figures, but market makers notched prices higher amid widespread relief that the figures would not lead to a further rise in interest rates. The trade figures `` were dismal but hardly disasterous,'' one dealer said. The trade deficit widened to 2.09 billion pounds, or $ 3.63 billion, from a revised deficit of 1.76 billion pounds in December, the government said. By 12:30 p.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was 24.4 points, or 1.2 percent, higher at 2,026.8 points, little changed from 2,025.0 just before the trade figures were released. The market reached its intraday high of 2,027.4 around midmorning and then fell to its low point of 2,014.3 minutes after the results of the data were known.

 A new plan to require $ 800 million in work on aging airliners will provide an extra margin of safety, even though the planes already are `` perfectly safe,'' an airline trade association official said today. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> and American airlines who worked on an aging-aircraft task force joined Tuesday in endorsing the group's far-reaching recommendations to increase the safety of older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> airliners Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> says steps are being taken to write the proposal into law. `` Collectively we decided that it was far better to be pre-emptive in our maintenance activity rather than to wait for problems to develop,'' <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an airline trade group, said today on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. The task force, which also included other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign industry and government safety experts, called for $ 600,000 in modifications and replacements on each of more than 1,300 older <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s, 737s and 727s. `` The aircraft that are out there right now are perfectly safe and the activities that the airlines are taking in regards to the maintenance were satisfactory,'' <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON> said. `` This supplies an extra protection margin.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doll </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> vice president for technical services, said the proposals conform with steps the airline is already taking to keep its older airliners in shape. `` We do n't anticipate anything over and above what we've already planned to do,'' said Doll. <PERSON> Kizer </PERSON> said the proposals had nothing to do with damage to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s oldest 747 on a flight from <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Auckland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, last Friday. Investigators into the incident in which nine passengers were hurled to their deaths over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> say they have found no signs of metal fatigue or corrosion associated with aging. Instead, they have focused on possible mechanical problems with the cargo door that ripped off along with a portion of the airliner's skin. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said none of his airline's fleet of 130 model 727s would be affected by the proposals right away `` It will be several years before we are affected because of fleet age,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s top executive, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON>, also endorsed the proposal, saying that unless older airliners are restored and kept operating, there may not be enough planes to serve the growing worldwide travel demand. No airliners would be scrapped under the proposal which asks the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to order the work that would include replacement of parts subject to wear rather than repeated inspections and repairs only when they wear out. An official of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactured the affected airliners, said the older jetliners covered by the plan are safe and should last indefinitely if the recommended work is done. `` We believe that the aircraft out there flying are safe,'' said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> engineering vice president who sits on the task force. But he said the work was needed to reduce the number of regular inspections needed for older aircraft. The recommendations are based on 150 service bulletins issued by <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which is now to write them into a single massive bulletin for presentation to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> praised the task force's work as the first product of a cooperative international government and industry effort to deal with the problem of the world's aging airliner fleet. The average age of the 8,800 airliners in use around the world is just over 13 years, and aviation experts predict that will increase each year for several years as new airliner construction is backlogged and few old aircraft are junked. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has already begun `` the internal rule-making procedures'' needed to make the recommended work mandatory for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines. In all, more than 1,300 airliners worldwide would be affected by the plan, about one-third of them operated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers. The recommendations would also be given to foreign airlines and regulatory bodies, some of whom participated on the task force. The proposed repairs and replacements would be tied to the number of times an airliner had taken off and landed and its time in the sky. Service records of older <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-10s, DC-9s and DC-8s and aircraft build overseas are also being studied by task force committees. They are due to make recommendations later this year.

<TEXT>
 Beer flowed freely in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> for the first time in 74 years today as the last vestiges of prohibition came to an end. Lines formed outside some of the nation's 17 state liquor stores. Waiting patrons applauded when the Snorra Braut liquor store in central <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION> opened for business at 9 a.m. Icelanders voted for prohibition in a 1908 referendum. The law did n't take effect until 1915, when it was assumed the last alcoholic beverage on the island had been drunk. The ban was repealed in 1933, but through a legal quirk beer with alcoholic content above 2.25 percent remained under prohibition. A powerful temperance lobby kept it that way until May when <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> voted 13-8 to lift the ban effective March 1. `` This is a truly historic moment in my life and the life of this nation,'' said <PERSON> Pall </PERSON> <PERSON> Sverrisson </PERSON>, a cab driver. `` This is what we have been fighting for, and this is what we have been dreaming of for so long.'' Many restaurants and bars reported their tables had been booked weeks in advance by customers planning to celebrate. The luxury does n't come cheap. With the government levying a hefty tax, liquor stores are charging up to $ 57.60 for a 24-can case of imported beer. A glass of beer in a bar costs $ 3.90 to $ 4.80. Education Minister <PERSON> Svavar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gestsson </PERSON>, who campaigned against lifting the ban, accused the media of hyping the occasion and said efforts to educate people on the dangers of drink `` have proved in vain against this terrible flood.'' <ORGANIZATION> Reykjavik </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Boedvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bragason </PERSON> said his force was on heightened alert for drunken drivers.

 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily agreed to terminate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and withhold his 1988 pay of more than $ 100 million, despite claims by the prominent bond trader that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was coerced into the provisions, the government said. In court papers filed Tuesday, federal prosecutors rejected a motion by <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> to have <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s firm's landmark securities fraud settlement with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> thrown out or modified because it violates <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s rights. The coercion issue is at the heart of the first legal challenge to the settlement. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> claims that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was forced to resolve the case or face racketeering charges that included freezing the investment firm's multibillion-dollar assets. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> alleged that the government forced <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to have him dismissed and his 1988 compensation, most of it in a bonus that would far surpass $ 100 million, withheld. Acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> called the charge of coercion `` nothing short of absurd.'' `` To argue that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, a highly sophisticated investment banking firm, represented by numerous highly qualified attorneys, was incapable of making a voluntary choice in this matter strains credulity,'' <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> wrote. In an accompanying affidavit, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said the investment firm entered into the plea agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` voluntarily and without coercion after consulting with counsel.'' The statement _ while technically accurate since <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the total pact _ appeared to be at odds with earlier statements by the company that it disputed portions of the agreement and fought to have provisions on <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> withdrawn. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> also was quoted in earlier court papers as saying the <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> provisions were `` unfair'' and `` horrendous'' and were inserted at the government's insistence. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in December agreed to pay a record $ 650 million fine and plead guilty to six felonies to settle criminal securities fraud charges with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> aide who also would lose at least half of his 1988 pay, charged that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> was coerced by the government into the requirements. Neither <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has been charged with any criminal wrongdoing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> is to rule on the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION>' motion. In his response, <PERSON> Romano </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> had failed to show that their employment, pay and bonuses were constitutionally protected or supported by a written contract. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> said neither of the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> had a contract with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who still heads <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, Calif.-based `` junk,'' or high-yield, bond financing department, is one of the biggest targets of a federal crackdown on securities law abuse. He is expected to be indicted on fraud and racketeering charges in connection with the government's lengthy investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. In a separate development, attorneys for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> sought to have proceedings halted while they ask the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to disqualify a judge presiding over <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s settlement of civil charges with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> have asked that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>, who must approve the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> pact, be disqualified because of an alleged conflict of interest. The <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION>' attorneys on Monday asked the 2nd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to issue a temporary injunction so <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> does not make any rulings on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decides whether to consider the disqualification motion. The 12-member court last week refused a request to consider the bid to have <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> disqualified on grounds that his wife could receive $ 30 million from a leveraged buyout <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> recently helped finance. A three-member court panel already had rejected the motion. If a stay were granted, it would hold up the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> settlement, which is in final negotiation stages. That in turn would delay completion of the criminal plea agreement, which is contingent on settlement of the civil charges.

Analysts noted that the market had shown signs since the start of the week of recovering from the recent jolt it suffered from bad news on inflation and a round of interest-rate increases.

 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today rejected a senator's request to delay a controversial overhaul of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's rate structure despite widespread congressional criticism of the proposed action. <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> told Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., he will press ahead at a March 16 commission meeting with the plan to change the way <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> charges customers He said the part of the proposal covering interstate service could go into effect July 1. <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> at the hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on communications if he would postpone consideration of the `` rate cap'' plan until two vacancies on the five-member <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> are filled by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The commission has been two members short since the beginning of last year and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has yet to announce choices for the open slots. `` It is extraordinarily important to restructure the incentives that we give this industry,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> told <PERSON> Exon </PERSON> today. `` We have to begin to send a message. The sooner we start on that, the better.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> on Tuesday told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> telecommunications and finance subcommittee the plan could save residential customers $ 700 million in the next four years while giving <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T the incentive to streamline and modernize. But subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., asked <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> `` why all the people who are purported to benefit from this plan still oppose it and why all those who are supposed to be regulated by it are clamoring for its immediate implementation? The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> proposal would change the two decades-old `` rate of return'' regulation that allows <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T certain specified profits beyond its costs. The new plan _ what <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> called `` incentive regulation'' _ would place a cap on what <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T could charge customers but would allow the company to keep any funds after costs as profit. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> let the plan die last year because of concerns that windfall profits could result at the expense of consumers, but <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> is moving ahead with it after making changes he says meet congressional concerns. `` We've made several changes to satisfy their concerns and we'll continue to discuss them,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> `` But the commission will consider the pricing matter on the 16th.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>'s July 1 target leaves congressional critics little time to pass an alternative that precludes the FCC. `` At this point, we do n't have a concensus,'' said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has left a vacuum that <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> is filling with his action. He urged his colleagues to `` preserve our role in the regulatory process.'' And Rep. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va., told reporters that <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> should postpone an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> vote for a second time `` in new of the bipartisan nature of the concerns expressed'' at Tuesday's hearing <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> was one of several lawmakers from rural areas who said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> has n't provided real safeguards to prevent <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T raising rates unfairly for sparsely populated regions while giving discounts to businesses and residents of cities. `` Talk may still be cheap in urban areas but it's about to get very expensive in rural areas,'' an absent Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said in a statement read at the hearing <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> told reporters <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> `` is making movement in the right direction, but I think it's not enough. `` I'd say we would have price caps in due course,'' he said. `` But under this plan, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T could be an enormous profit machine.'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> outlined provisions that would limit <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's ability to raise or lower rates for various customers and said he would look at other safeguards to ensure price changes for less populated regions `` remain within the zone of reasonableness.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T would have to cut overall prices by 3 percent over four years under the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> plan. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> also sought to mollify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by proposing to divide <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's services into three `` baskets'' _ one group including residential and small business customers, for example _ and allowing only limited price increases or decreases for each service.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> introduced three new copiers today, including two low-volume models and a copier with a beveled edge that can make copies from books without ruining bindings. The machines were displayed at a news conference at the company's major manufacturing center in the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The low-volume copiers, the 5012 and the 5014, make 12 copies a minute and come with <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s unique three-year warranty on parts and labor and a copy cartridge guarantee. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> has always enjoyed a strong position in the mid - and high-volume copier segments, but has not fared as well in the highly competitive low-volume and personal copier markets These new machines represent the company's attempt to increase its presence in the low-volume market, which includes machines that make up to 30 copies a minute, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>, vice president of reprographics product support for <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're aiming to set the industry benchmark for quality and value in the low-volume range,'' <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> said. The 5012 costs $ 2,325. The 5014, which has reduction and enlargement capabilities, costs $ 2,850. The company's other new copier, the 5042, was designed for book copying, mostly with the library industry in mind, <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON> said. It has a 35-degree slanted copying surface and a hinged cover that will follow the shape of a book or other bound material instead of squashing it down. It makes 35 copies a minute. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> officials said their studies found that in 1985 libraries spent about $ 40 million to repair broken book bindings and they believe the 5042 machine will help save bindings. The machine also features a versatile vending attachment that will accept coins, bills and special vending cards. `` We have offered vending before, but it was just coins,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of decentralized product marketing. `` And librarians told us they were tired of spending their whole day making change for people.'' The 5042 costs $ 9,470. All of the machines are available to buy or rent immediately.

<HEAD>Spending By Consumers and Builders Weakens</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Grafs 1-6 new with Commerce Department reports today, picks
up 5th graf pvs, Consumer spending...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The government issued two reports today suggesting economic growth is weakening, contrary to a fourth-quarter 1988 assessment issued Tuesday that signaled rising inflation and an unabated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appetite for foreign goods. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Americans' personal income shot up 1.8 percent in January, the biggest increase in more than a year, but that the pace of consumer spending was nearly unchanged after a strong gain in December. A slowdown in consumer spending would be welcome news to some because of worries that demand has been outstripping the production capabilities of factories already coping with high operating rates and tight labor markets. In another report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending rose 0.4 percent in January, the weakest performance since October. Rising interest rates have dampened activity in most areas of the construction business, with fixed-rate mortgages averaging nearly 11 percent. The reports came a day after the department released figures on fourth-quarter growth that worried economists because it suggested pickup in inflation, partly because of the summer drought. While the overall growth figure of 2 percent was unchanged from an initial report a month ago, the report also showed that the country's trade imbalance worsened even more than previously estimated. Imports grew at an annual rate of 13 percent, swamping a 7 percent gain in exports. Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual rate, too fast given constraints on production resulting from tight labor markets and high factory operating rates, economists said. The jump in consumer spending, which went primarily to big-ticket items such as cars, also showed Americans are still spending and borrowing to buy foreign goods. In other economic news Tuesday, a real estate trade group reported sales of existing homes fell 7.4 percent in January, the biggest decline in two years. But housing industry experts said the drop reflected a return to more normal buying patterns following a December sales spurt. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> said that existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.63 million units in January after 5.7 percent rise in December to a rate of 3.92 million. None of the reports had much impact on the financial markets. On Wall Street, stock prices rose slightly in what analysts called a reflex response to its sharp declines of the previous week. Bond prices, a sensitive barometer of the economy, fell sightly, and the dollar finished mixed against foreign currencies.

 The stock market put together a mild advance today with some help from falling interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.32 to 2,265.71 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 775 up, 460 down and 572 unchanged. Analysts noted that the market had shown signs since the start of the week of recovering from the recent jolt it suffered from bad news on inflation and a round of interest-rate increases. Rates declined modestly in the bond and short-term money markets this morning. That apparently prompted money managers at investing institutions to resume their buying of stocks in order to show competitive performance results and a sizeable commitment to the market by the time they make their first-quarter reports at the end of the month.

 <ORGANIZATION> Telemedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest publisher of consumer magazines, said Wednesday it has reached a tentative agreement to buy <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monthly </ORGANIZATION>, a 5-year-old regional magazine that has been struggling toward profitability. Terms of the sale were not disclosed pending ratification of the agreement by the magazine's 59 shareholders. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nylen </PERSON>, the publisher, said the legal papers will be completed this week and the shareholders probably will vote before the end of March. <ORGANIZATION> Telemedia </ORGANIZATION> said both <PERSON> Nylen </PERSON>, 44, and the magazine's editor, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Okrent </PERSON>, 40, will continue in their jobs. Despite winning national awards for journalism and tripling its circulation to more than 116,000, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Monthly's costs continue to exceed its revenues, <PERSON> Nylen </PERSON> said. `` We started in 1984 and we've made progress in each subsequent year _ each year we've shaved our losses by several hundred thousand dollars _ and now we're within striking distance of profitability,'' <PERSON> Nylen </PERSON> said. The magazine, based in <LOCATION> Haydenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, has a staff of 40 and annual revenues of more than $ 4 million. It won National Magazine Awards for general excellence in 1985 and 1986. A literate, breezy, often irreverent publication, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Monthly frequently profiles small companies or craftsmen and devotes one issue a year to `` local heroes.'' But it has been harshly critical of some of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s most powerful institutions and individuals. Recent issues, for example, have cast <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s leading families and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Lotus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in an unflattering light Approximately $ 6 million has been invested in the magazine since 1984, and <PERSON> Nylen </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Telemedia </ORGANIZATION> will inject `` a few million dollars'' more to keep it going. `` I expect that the magazine will operate much as it has. But it is not immutable,'' <PERSON> Nylen </PERSON> said. `` What we really want is their advice and counsel, and that may mean changes in marketing, advertising or other areas.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Telemedia </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for finance, said stockholders of the magazine will not receive any payment up front, but will be paid over a period of years under a formula tied to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> Monthly's future earnings. He declined to comment on the potential size of the payments. The shareholders include private investors, venture capitalists and two British merchant banks. <ORGANIZATION> Telemedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s other holdings include Canadian television and radio stations, the Canadian edition of <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guide </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Harrowsmith </PERSON> magazine.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock investors virtually overlooked news of a wider-than-expected British trade deficit Wednesday and bid shares higher on newly found hopes that the government might be able to avoid raising interest rates. Equities were marked broadly lower immediately after the trade figures were announced before midday, but there was n't any selling pressure to justify the markdown and prices soon recovered to their best levels of the day. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s merchandise trade deficit widened sharply to 2.09 billion pounds, or $ 3.63 billion, in January from a revised deficit of 1.76 billion pounds in December, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There was relief that we did n't get a trade figure that implied an immediate interest-rate rise,'' an analyst said. `` It is still felt the authorities will avoid a rate rise if they can hope to do so.'' At the close, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 18.9 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,021.3. Volume was moderate, with 535.4 million shares changing hands, but most of this business came on a spurt of buying interest in the morning, dealers said. On Tuesday, turnover was a meager 357.8 million shares.

 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' 824 stores across the nation began reopening today after a 42-hour facelift to complete price reductions on 1.5 billion pieces of merchandise. `` People are backed up as far as we can see. It's wall-to-wall people, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Northland Mall store in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> `` We have Christmas-quantity people, and we have better than Christmas traffic,'' said <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, who estimated that more than 1,000 people waited outside for the doors to open. Workers changed prices Tuesday on everything _ including light bulbs, toasters and polished door knobs _ as <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> prepared for a new retailing strategy it hopes will win customers. Employees also had to change signs and displays, take inventory and clean up before the openings, which occurred at noon local time. `` The worst was the screwdrivers,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, a high school freshman who spent much of the day at the Northland Mall store in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, repricing baby booties and toddlers' dresses `` You had to take them all down, clean each one by hand, then put them all back.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> intends to keep its prices low year-round, instead of marking them up and down periodically for sales. This marks a major change for the retailer, which helped to pioneer the concept of the sale. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> sold 55 percent of its goods at `` sale'' prices. The company said it still will run some sales, but for reasons like simply clearing out lawn mowers in the fall. Otherwise, it will use the strategy that retailers call `` everyday low pricing.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, in adopting the strategy, joins a growing list, that includes <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Target discount chain and <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> and Co.. At the Columbus store, 700 workers scrambled to the tune of `` Do n't Worry, Be Happy,'' as they marked down items such as twin canopy beds from $ 269.99 to $ 99.00, a Diehard automobile battery from $ 72 to $ 64, and a Craftsman power drill from $ 59.99 to $ 32.62 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' new strategy meant reductions on 75 percent of its own brands and the 1,000 other brand names it carries. `` I do n't think they had any choice. They lost their customer base,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacks </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think Wednesday will be a madhouse at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. But will they be able to re-educate their customers not to come in just for a sale?'' <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the strategy paid off in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, where sales rose 15 percent when <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> tested the idea last fall. `` And <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> will invest in an advertising campaign that, to not hear about it, you would practically have to be comatose,'' <PERSON> Greenstein </PERSON> said. The cash register rings about 3,000 times a day in the 100,000-square-foot <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> store, but the only sound in the last couple of days was the clicking of pricing guns and muffled sounds of store officials keeping in touch with walkie-talkies. About 100 high school students worked for $ 5 an hour to help company officials in shirt-sleeves and scores of others with the makeover. `` It's the most exciting thing I've ever been involved in in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON>, manager of the Northland Mall store and a 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> employee. `` It's no longer that old sea of yellow,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' old yellow-with-black-lettering sale signs. The new signs, touting new, lower prices, are in vibrant red and blue. In apparel, the signs are magenta and gray. `` They really needed to do something dramatic like that,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sacks </PERSON> said. `` We'll just have to wait a year or two to see if it works.''

<BYLINE>Private Mausoleum Manufacturing a Growth Business</BYLINE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLD SPRING, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One man ordered a custom-built granite mausoleum with two crypts included for the family's German shepherd dogs. Another family asked for a specially designed walk-in above-ground burial building with space for a son's favorite car. A third family had a mausoleum designed to include a favorite chair from their sitting room for relatives to use when they come to meditate the past. They're part of a growing market for preassembled or custom-built solid mausoleums that inspired <ORGANIZATION> Cold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Granite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading granite supplier with revenues of about $ 150 million in 1988, to establish a Private Estates division to focus on what had been a small part of company business. `` There's a trend of people wanting to be buried above ground and it's increasing every year,'' said <PERSON> Wally </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattock </PERSON>, vice president of memorialization. `` It's not something we developed, it's demand by the people.'' Of the approximately 2.3 million people who die in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year, nearly 10 percent have arranged for mausoleum entombment, according to Cold Spring Granite, which has corporate offices in St. Cloud, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> and two of its fabrication plants in the nearby Cold Spring area. People have several reasons for choosing above-ground burial, said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohnen </PERSON>, whose title is market manager-memorialization for Private Estates. `` The people most interested in private estates are those who were nearly famous, who had major accomplishments but perhaps did n't get the recognition they feel they should have,'' <PERSON> Bohnen </PERSON> said The mausoleums `` are intended for the person who is looking for a more exclusive form of immortality,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Terhaar </PERSON>, general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> division. The growth of the private mausoleum industry, he said, is a carryover from the increase in burials in large community mausoleums around the country. Mausoleums have been popular in the southern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where the water table or sandy soil makes in-ground burial impossible in many areas, the company officials said. `` I always hear the words, ` It's clean, it's dry above ground,''' <PERSON> Terhaar </PERSON> said. Cold Spring Granite sold between 200 and 300 preassembled mausoleum units in 1988. The units contain from two to six crypts and range in estimated retail price from $ 12,000 to $ 40,000, <PERSON> Bohnen </PERSON> said. There is no upper limit on the cost of custom units, which have been sold for as much as $ 1.5 million. Except for highly specialized custom work, all sales of Private Estates mausoleums are through cemeteries or monument retailers. The wealthy are n't the only ones to buy mausoleums. Middle aged and elderly also are customers, <PERSON> Terhaar </PERSON> said. `` It really runs the gamut of society. In our -LRB- local -RRB- cemetery, we have a guy who worked in the plant, crating products,'' he said. `` It goes all the way up. It's not so much the ability to pay, it's more a desire for above-ground entombment `` Certainly in number we sell more at the low end. That is within the means of many, many more people,'' said <PERSON> Terhaar </PERSON>, who estimated that the <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION> division represents 2 percent to 3 percent of Cold Spring Granite's total sales. `` We're trying to double that this year,'' he said. While there are several other companies in the country that make mausoleums, Cold Spring Granite offers special service in helping retailers sell the products and sending crews to cemeteries to erect the buildings, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, a retail business that has bought mausoleums from Cold Spring Granite. `` It's not a very common sale,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, who has sold nine mausoleums ranging in price from $ 12,000 to $ 750,000 in 25 years of business. `` I would say the largest percentage of monument shops, like I am, never even sell one during their time in business.'' Customers who buy the larger, walk-in mausoleums normally are affluent families, he said in a telephone interview. `` It continues their lifestyle, their honored place in society, in death as well as in life. I really feel it's a prestigious type of purchase,'' said <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>. But sometimes, he said, retailers have to let customers know the mausoleums are an option. `` I think the dealer has to show the product. It's like buying any other item. If you do n't know about the Cadillac and they only show you Fords, you're gon na buy a <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said.

<HEAD>Contrary Views</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It can be refreshing and revealing, and even educational, to take a contrary view of old and accepted `` truths,'' such as the notion that the customer is always right. Repeated again and again, some popular assumptions are accepted without criticism, acted on without examination and repeated as the gospel truth. Beware. In economics, old truths often are revealed as old errors. There still exist, for example, many trusting purchasers who believe the adage that the customer is always right. And there are dutiful companies that faithfully adhere to that philosophy and even advertise it. But that does n't mean they really believe it. While not acknowledging it publicly, some producers of products and services blame customers for not having the common sense to read directions or the ability to follow the directions they have read. Research seems to document it. `` Two complaints out of three are caused by problems for which the customer is at least partly to blame,'' according to a research report in `` The Quality Review,'' a professional journal. `` Instances in which customer incompetence has caused problems span virtually every industry in every country,'' it states, the moral being that perfect quality control at the factory can not satisfy imperfect customers. It cites the example of an unnamed manufacturer who became so fed up with improper use of his product he ordered a sticker placed on each item. It read: `` When all else fails, read the directions.'' Another accepted `` truth'' is that the federal budget deficit is the worst ever, that it is the cause of numerous other problems and that there is no way to correct these problems without balancing the budget. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessauer </PERSON>, an investment adviser who adorns his `` Journal of Financial Markets'' with the slogan, `` authentic developments from an untrodden point of view,'' feels we might be trodding over a clod in the sod. Forgotten by all is the fact that a dollar in 1988 was worth only 48 cents compared with a dollar in 1976, he says. His point is this: A 1988 federal deficit of $ 155.1 billion is the same as a deficit of $ 74 billion in 1976. Since the actual deficit in 1976 was $ 73.7 billion, he says, `` the truth is that the federal deficit today is about the same as it was when President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> took office.'' That's by one measurement. By another, he says, it might be even less of a problem. In 1976, he points out, the federal deficit was 4.3 percent of gross national product. In 1988, it was 3.1 percent. Two other economic assumptions have gained tremendous respectability of late, especially since they have been cited as inflation signals by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. With industrial capacity at close to 85 percent, and with the jobless rate falling well below 5.5 percent, the assuumption is that inflation is about to become red hot. Economists, often argumentative, are almost unanimous about this. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Yardeni </PERSON>, economics director at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> INc. </ORGANIZATION>, disagrees strongly. This is how he views the low jobless rate and its potential consequences: `` We believe that the employers recognize that offering big wage hikes will only drive up their labor costs rather than attract workers that, demographically speaking, do n't exist.'' Instead, he contends, `` industries will opt to spend more on labor-saving, productivity-enhancing capital to substitute for scarce and expensive workers.'' What about the capacity limitations of industry? `` We believe that tight capacity stimulates capacity expansion rather than big price increases,'' he says. He contends that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s tough anti-inflation policy is also anti-growth. And that, he argues, `` could dampen the capacity expansion which is the best way of eliminating inflationary bottlenecks.''

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Sink On Easing Supply Signals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices closed sharply lower Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts for rain in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s soybean fields and signs that supplies may not be as tight as previously feared. Wheat futures advanced modestly due to an increase in export business while corn futures finished mixed. Soybean futures plunged in the session's final 10 minutes following forecasts for rain in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> later today and over the weekend. The selling also reflected an increase Wednesday in the number of notices of intent to deliver soybeans against the March contract. A greater number of notices indicates a greater willingness among commercial traders to sell physical soybeans, which suggests an easing of supply fears. Soybean delivery notices posted Wednesday morning totaled 9.2 million bushels compared with 4.4 million bushels on Tuesday, the first notice day for the March contract. Wheat gained strength from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to target <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for sales of 1 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat at subsidized prices, and from reports that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was bidding for 500,000 metric tons of subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat. At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.39 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with March at $ 2.71 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -RCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.03 a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 12 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.50 -LCB- a bushel.

<HEAD>Sears Unveils New Prices, Ending Era of Big Sales</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Shoppers swarmed to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which reopened its 824 stores Wednesday after cutting prices on 50,000 items to introduce its new `` everyday low pricing'' policy and mark the end of an era in retailing. The nation's biggest retailer switched to more name-brand merchandise and discount prices in hopes of luring shoppers away from cut-rate competitors like K mart and <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION>, which have grown rapidly at the expense of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> and other old-line general retailers. `` I think it might cheapen them a little bit but they're a grade higher than K mart,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cage </PERSON>, 31, one of about 3,000 shoppers who crowded a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s International Mall on Wednesday. The 103-year-old company added some suspense to the changeover by closing all its stores for 42 hours, from 6 p.m. local time Monday until noon Wednesday. Store managers and employees around the country worked late into the night Tuesday, retagging an estimated 1.5 billion pieces of merchandise and erecting colorful signs touting the new prices. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, about 200 people gathered outside of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' <LOCATION> Southlake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> store to get the first crack at the lower prices _ though not all of them were convinced the change was for the better. `` My mother said if they cut all those prices it would be like K mart. I say the day they do that is the day I stop buying here,'' said <PERSON> Marcy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullough </PERSON> of <PERSON> McDonough </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. But in the past, she said, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> has been `` charging too much for stuff that's not really worth it.'' Prices under the new policy may vary among the retailers' 24 regions, but <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> officials are convinced the strategy will win approval. `` When customers come in and see we're not fooling around when we say we're reducing prices, they'll be very impressed,'' predicted <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, manager of a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s Northwest Side. Shoppers found markdowns Wednesday that approached 25 percent on some items, including a house-brand Kenmore 18-cubic-foot refrigerator slashed to $ 550 from $ 730 in <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s store. He said the new price would be <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' everyday price on the refrigerator. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' switch to everyday low pricing, a strategy pioneered by discount chains and adapted successfully last year by Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, makes <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> comparable to the discounters in price but not in looks. Although shoppers found some merchandise displayed in warehouse-like stacks, most of the goods were shown in the more decorative fashion familiar to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> shoppers. The strategy marks a departure from the traditional retailing technique, which <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> practically invented, of hyping goods through periodic sales. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said it will continue to have sales, but they will be fewer and thinner than in the past. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wels </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Sewaren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said he was worried that the drop in prices could mean a decline in quality as well. `` I will still buy at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> but I will check out the quality,'' he said. But not all customers were pleased. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Carver </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Barkhamsted </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said she drove to a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store to exchange some bedsheets and found the price was about 20 percent higher than the week before. Operating Manager <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Glowa </PERSON> said the sheets had been on sale last week and were not among the items reduced in price on Wednesday. The new policy is a major component of a restructuring plan that also includes the proposed sale of the company's towering headquarters building in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a realignment of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' financial network _ <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> insurance, <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> brokerage services and <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> real estate _ to focus on consumer business <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> stores will continue to change in coming months as more name-brand goods are introduced. A major addition will be the opening of Brand Central electronics superstores inside 400 Sears outlets.

 Stock prices took a spill today after an early advance faltered. Analysts noted that the market had shown signs since the start of the week of recovering from the recent jolt it suffered as a result of bad news on inflation and a round of interest-rate increases. The upswing continued as rates declined modestly in the bond and short-term money markets this morning. But then the bond market gave up its gains as traders studied a government report showing stronger-than-expected gains in personal income for January. By late afternoon, prices of long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, showed losses of about $ 5 for eaach $ 1,000 in face value.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> hopes a copier introduced Wednesday will save the encyclopedias, dictionaries and other books in libraries around the country from broken-binding syndrome. The Xerox 5042 has a slanted edge and a hinged cover that allow a book or other bound material to be laid flat without squashing or stretching the binding. `` We've responded very directly to a market need,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>, vice president of reprographics product support for <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> officials said their studies found that libraries spent about $ 40 million in 1985 to repair broken book bindings. `` This is very much of a niche kind of product, but it's the kind of thing that will give <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> a presence in places it wants to be, like universities and libraries, where a lot of people will see their name,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sostilio </PERSON>, a copier-industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The 5042 makes 35 copies a minute and can make reductions and enlargements. It sells for $ 9,470. The machine also features a vending attachment that accepts coins, bills and magnetic cards. `` We have offered vending before, but it was just coins,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of decentralized product marketing. `` And librarians told us they were tired of spending their whole day making change for people.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> asked copier companies to come up with a copier that would n't damage books and would make better copies of bound materials. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> is one of two companies to offer a machine built with libraries in mind. The other manufacturer, Oce Business Systems of <LOCATION> Venlo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, introduced two library copiers in January, said company spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. Also on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> introduced two new low-volume copiers that are designed to keep the company ahead in that highly competitive segment of the market, which includes copiers that make up to 30 copies a minute.

<HEAD>Agents Say Travelers Fleeing Eastern Bookings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Would-be travelers to and from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> were steering away from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as the carrier's Saturday strike deadline neared, travel agents said Wednesday Agents said most customers were asking to change reservations or turn in Eastern tickets. Eastern's largest union, the Machinists, is poised for a strike if no contract settlement is reached by Friday midnight. There has been a surge in ticket sales at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors, said several agents interviewed Wednesday. Agents said participants in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s OnePass frequent flier program were for the most part sticking with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, but the agents were reluctant to book other customers on the carrier. Eastern says anybody with a ticket for an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> flight that is canceled will get a refund or a seat on another airline. Besides confusing travelers in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s major markets _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ the looming strike has also raised the specter of disruption of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s lucrative ocean cruise business. At <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Happy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holidays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION>, which does about 30 percent of its business in Eastern tickets, `` Most of them -LRB- customers -RRB- phone up and say right away: ` Please try and get me another airline,''' said manager <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> <PERSON> Mompoint </PERSON>. `` A lot of people -LRB- are -RRB- calling up asking not to be put on Eastern,'' said a travel agent at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Barry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> who identified herself only as <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPietro </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Esplanade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> reported that his company remained `` hesitant'' about booking with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> `` until we learn more about what is going to happen.'' He said his agency is only booking Eastern if clients specifically request the troubled airline. Even travel agents actively booking seats on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said they only do so with a warning to customers. Agent <PERSON> Galen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wightman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said his Washington-based company was advising customers of the possibility of a strike, and warning that alternative arrangements might have to be made at the last minute. <PERSON> Mompoint </PERSON> said agents at Happy Holidays inform customers that Eastrern tickets ` usually get accepted'' by other airlines in the event of a strike. At <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, airline spokeswoman <PERSON> Cori </PERSON> <PERSON> Zywotow </PERSON> pledged disruption caused by a strike would be kept to a minimum. `` Eastern will refund tickets on canceled flights,'' she said. `` If you want your money back, you'll receive a full refund.'' According to <PERSON> Zywotow </PERSON>, agreements between <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and other major airlines stipulate that tickets which are endorsed by Eastern for travel on another airline will be honored by other carriers at no additional cost. That accord, she said, also covers discount-fare tickets purchased from Eastern. The effectiveness of the inter-line agreement, however, was being called into question by several other airlines _ including <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, all of which have reportedly withheld unconditional acceptance of Eastern tickets pending their own reviews of the situation. Some airline analysts have said Eastern might seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, which would make it difficult for other carriers to be compensated. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s cruise lines, which carry each year nearly 4 million passengers _ most of them flown in from around the country and abroad _ could also be adversely affected by a strike at Eastern.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s oil and gas production and exploration units will be sold for about $ 1.4 billion to a British concern to help finance a friendly takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday. The agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> was reached just days after the two <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> natural gas companies signed a $ 3.2 billion merger agreement. `` They were able to reach this deal so quickly because the sale to Enterprise had been under consideration by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> made its offer to acquire the company,'' <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. The sale to <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> includes <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and Norwegian sectors of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said. The holdings include 13 producing oil and gas fields, six fields that are under development and 14 undeveloped fields. Enterprise Oil is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, according to a notice of the proposed acquisition. If the purchase is approved, <ORGANIZATION> Enterpise </ORGANIZATION> said it would become the leading independent oil exploration and production company in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> in terms of reserves, production and acreage. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Feb. 20 merger agreement included a provision to sell non-pipeline assets to help finance the acquisition. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials said the sale announced Wednesday was a big step toward that goal. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsucker </PERSON>, chairman, president and chief executive officer at <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, said his company approved the sale under terms of the merger agreement. <PERSON> Hunsucker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> expected the sale to net more than $ 1.2 billion after taxes, with proceeds to be used to help pay off most of $ 1.7 billion in short-term loans taken for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> buyout. `` The $ 1.4 billion sale price meets our expectations and is completely in line with what our financial analysis revealed,'' <PERSON> Hunsucker </PERSON> said in a statement. The sale is expected to be complete in 60 to 90 days, officials said, and is subject to approval by <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and the British government. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials said last week that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 44 percent share in <ORGANIZATION> Petrolane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> also could be sold within 60 days after the merger is complete. The master limited partnership, formed through the company's <ORGANIZATION> Petrolane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary in 1987, serves the international liquid petroleum gas market <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is financing 80 percent, or $ 2.6 billion, of its $ 3.2 billion takeover along with $ 1.05 billion in refinancing and working capital, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said. The $ 1.7 billion in interim financing is included in the figures. <ORGANIZATION> Panhandle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 53-a-share cash tender offer came weeks after <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> rejected as inadequate Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 2.6 billion takeover bid. <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has extended its offer but has not said whether it intends to increase the $ 42-a-share cash bid.

In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, dealers bid up the value of the mark on the grounds that West German monetary authorities soon might raise interest rates to reduce economic activity and relieve inflationary pressures. European dealers had earlier sold marks amid speculation there that prospects for higher West German interests have diminished, due partly to the currency's strength. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading, which ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed at 127.68 Japanese yen, up from 127.15.

 A decision by <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to manufacture computer memory chips in this <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb could eventually create more than 1,200 jobs, Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON> announced at a news conference that the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, Calif.-based company will lease vacant space at the former <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microelectronics </ORGANIZATION> plant in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Summit. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> continues to manufacture electronic components at the plant. <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> officials said Alliance is receiving $ 8.42 million in start-up financing from public and private sources. Alliance said it hopes eventually to employ more than 1,200 workers in two `` clean rooms'' at the plant but said it will need financial backing to meet that goal. Clean rooms are immaculate work places designed designed to allow precise manufacturing of minute equipment. The company expects to hire as many as 300 people in the next year to make chips in one of the 22,000-square-foot clean rooms, but expansion into the second room and additional employment will depend upon Alliance getting another $ 40 million to $ 50 million in financing, President <PERSON> N.D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON> said after a press conference at the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T plant. <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON> said the start-up financing will get initial manufacturing started, but more cash will be needed if Alliance is to expand and thrive. He said Alliance hopes to raise the financing, possibly through a public stock offering, within a year. Alliance, which was established in 1985, consists of 10 people working out of offices in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. The company has licensed a Japanese company, <ORGANIZATION> NMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION>, to make the fast memory chips Alliance has designed. The <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Summit plant would be <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>'s only wholly owned manufacturing site The plant will make static random access memory chips -LRB- SRAMs -RRB- and eventually dynamic random access memory chips, also called DRAMs. SRAMs are faster but more expensive than the more common DRAMs. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> dominates the world market for computer memory chips. Alliance will invest $ 250,000 in the start-up, while the remainder will come from other investors.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Leap On Peruvian Strike, Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices soared Wednesday amid supply concerns prompted by labor unrest in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and underlined by the small number of copper delivery notices posted on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange. On other exchanges, precious-metals futures prices plummeted; soybean futures dropped sharply; and grain, energy, and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Copper settled 3.9 cents to 8.8 cents higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in March at $ 1.455 a pound, the highest settlement price for the March contract since Jan. 27 but still well below the record high for spot copper of $ 1.6475 a pound reached Dec. 8 on the exchange. The rally was sparked by news that miners in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the world's sixth-largest copper producer, would consider extending a planned 3-day strike if conditions warrant The strike is scheduled to begin on March 26. The reports stirred memories of last fall's 57-day Peruvian mining strike, which was a major factor in copper's rise to record price levels. Demand for copper remains strong and supplies continue to be tight, a situation reflected in the slim number of delivery notices posted Tuesday and Wednesday on the exchange. The delivery notices signify the intent of commercial traders to deliver copper against the March contract, which expires on March 29. A small number of delivery notices would indicate a reluctance or inability among copper processors to deliver the metal, suggesting that their own supplies are limited. Only three delivery notices were issued Tuesday, the first notice day, and none were posted on Wednesday. Analysts said the market's bullish supply-and-demand factors and strong chart signals could lead to another run at record price levels. `` It's starting to look like a replay of 1987 and 1988,'' when copper prices reached their last two peaks, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Demler </PERSON>, metals economist with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Platinum led a steep sell-off in precious-metals futures as the strengthening dollar and rising interest rates spurred a further retreat of investors from precious metals, a traditional hedge against inflation. Platinum settled $ 9.30 to $ 9.80 lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with April at $ 531.10 a troy ounce. On the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold settled $ 3.30 to $ 3.70 lower with April at $ 387.10 a troy ounce; silver was 8 cents to 10.1 cents lower with March at $ 5.744 a troy ounce. Soybean futures dropped sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid forecasts for rain in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s soybean fields. Wheat futures advanced modestly due to an increase in export business while corn futures finished mixed. The soybean sell-off also reflected a steep increase Wednesday in the number of delivery notices posted against the March contract. Wheat settled 1 -RCB- cents to 4 cents higher with March at $ 4.39 \ a bushel; corn was -RCB- cent lower to -RCB- cent higher with March at $ 2.71 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 2.02 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents to 12 -LCB- cents lower with March at $ 7.50 -LCB- a bushel Crude oil futures posted modest gains on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but prices for refined products ended narrowly mixed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents to 13 cents higher with April at $ 18.28 a barrel; heating oil was .29 cent lower to .30 cent higher with April at 50.49 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .08 cent lower to .30 cent higher with April at 51.56 cents a gallon. Expectations of a demand slump weighed on the cattle futures market at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while pork futures gained in a technically inspired rally. Live cattle settled .20 cent to .78 cent lower with April at 77.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .28 cent lower with March at 82.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent to .65 cent lower with April at 44.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to .50 cent lower with March at 38.67 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
 A highly successful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government campaign to give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> tobacco companies a share of the lucrative Asian market is prompting congressional complaints that federal agencies are `` exporting death.'' A bipartisan group of congressmen plans to introduce legislation Thursday that would forbid the government from going to bat for the cigarette industry overseas. `` The message we are sending is that <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> lungs are more expendable than American lungs,'' says Rep. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, D-Calif. Says Rep. <PERSON> Chet </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, D-Mass., `` If we are as sensitive as we are about the health of American consumers, this certainly looks like an outrageous double standard <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> and <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> will be joined by Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittaker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and the environment, in introducing the Tobacco exports mushroomed during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration as a result of a highly effective campaign against foreign trade barriers by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> special trade representative's office and other agencies. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tobacco sales to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> increased by 76 per cent in 1987. Tobacco-related earnings worldwide totaled about $ 2.5 billion. <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> sees th overseas sale of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cigarettes as a health issue _ `` exporting death,'' he calls it. But his detractors in the tobacco industry and elsewhere regard it as a trade issue that takes on crucial importance because of the country's huge, albeit declining, trade deficit. The deficit for 1988 was $ 137.3 billion. Under the draft legislation, the president would be prevented from seeking the `` removal or reduction by any foreign country of any restrictions'' on the advertising, manufacture, packaging, importation, sale or distribution of tobacco products. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes the industry's interests, says other countries are `` perfectly capable of determining and applying rules and regulations regarding tobacco products, and they do n't need the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stepping in to provide guidelines on how to handle that product in their own country.'' The legislation also would require all exported tobacco to carry either a surgeon general's warning about the hazards of smoking or a comparable warning established by the importing country. Says <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Eaton </PERSON>, an aide to Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, a stalwart backer of the tobacco industry, `` We certainly think that as long as tobacco is a legal product we will fight to see that it can take advantage of the same agricultural export programs that other commodities receive.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government apparently operates with two minds about the propriety of promoting tobacco exports. Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> says, `` I do n't think that we as citizens can continue to tolerate exporting disease, disability and death.'' But <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative for <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, has a different view. <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON> did not return a reporter's phone call but was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying, `` It's not as though we are introducing <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to tobacco. The Chinese manufacture and consume 1.3 trillion cigarettes annually. `` The market in <LOCATION> Tiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was established long before any trade negotiations, and they're going to smoke whether the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> is exporting cigarettes or not.'' From all appearances, <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON> has more clout than <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON> has been the point man for the campaign to help tobacco companies gain access to previously restricted markets in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Allgeier </PERSON>'s lever was Section 301 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Act of 1974, which gives the government the authority to impose sanctions against any nation whose trade policies are `` unjustifiable, unreasonable or discriminatory.'' Under threat of retaliatory <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tariffs, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> opened its doors to foreign cigarettes in October 1986. According to World Watch magazine, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> quadrupled. Under similar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> also dropped their restrictions on foreign cigarettes. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said overall cigarette consumption has been declining in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The World Watch article, written by <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Heise </PERSON>, says there has been a 5 per cent increase in cigarette consumption in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since the restrictions were dropped. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government publication, World Situation and Tobacco Report, says that after advertising for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cigarette commercials began saturating Japanese television, cigarette sales in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> increased 2 per cent, reversing a 20-year downward trend. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Connally </PERSON>, who returned this week from a 10-day trip to <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, says the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government should do less for the tobacco industry and more for food exporters. `` We're using valuable trading chits for a product that has no nutritional value,'' he says. While American beef, wheat, rice and citrus products are denied access to many Asian countries, he says, `` Marlboros and Winstons are going to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Analysts: Premier May Pave Way For Cigarette Revolution, Despite

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s high-tech, smokeless cigarette may have been pulled from test markets, but some analysts said Wednesday the experimental smokes could start the same sort of product revolution that Tab did for diet soft drinks 20 years ago. `` I think down the road it will do real well,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, a vice president in the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Carolinas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a little rough, but I think the concept is good and in the next 25 years we're going to see more companies go to this.'' <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it was withdrawing its Premier brand after five months of test marketing in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. Smokers complained that the cigarette, which used a carbon heat source to pull warm air over a flavor capsule and dried tobacco, had a bad taste and smell. `` Everyone I know who tried it thought it was really horrible,'' said <PERSON> Pavlos </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandrakis </PERSON>, who follows tobacco companies for <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, himself a smoker, said he had tried one of the cigarettes when <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> made a presentation to investment groups. The flavor, he said, `` was less than thrilling, that's about all I can say.'' `` It was a very strange thing, if you're a smoker,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. `` There were no ashes, but you kept flicking it out of habit. It had a strange taste because you were n't burning any tobacco, just drawing air through it.'' Despite his own experience with Premiers, <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said he expects to see similar innovations in the future. `` I remember the first Tabs, how terrible they were,'' <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. `` They tasted just awful, but now you have diet <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>, diet <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>, all these diet drinks. It really was a revolutionary product. `` More new products fail than succeed, so Premier's failure _ and I'm not sure it's a total failure _ is not really surprising,'' he said. `` You try to find out what's wrong with a product in your test marketing and they've obviously been given some things to work on. `` I'm sure they'll take it back to the lab and keep tampering with it and monkeying around with it and they'll come up with something pretty good,'' he said. `` The consumer will tell them if they've worked it out somewhere down the road.'' `` This is no surprise,'' said industry analyst <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>. `` It was brought out stillborn.'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, who works for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Premier suffered from two fatal problems: unacceptable taste and aroma. `` What the company was saying was consumers will get used to it, they'll give it an extra try,'' he said. `` That's inconsistent with the fact that we are a nation of channel-hoppers, and if you do n't like it the first time, you're not going to try it a second time. Tobacco growers initially were uneasy with Premiers because they used significantly less tobacco than regular cigarettes, but <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Blalock </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION>, said he doubts farmers will be jumping up and down with joy over Premier's demise. `` Everybody said from the start it would have been better had it been a product that used more tobacco than a regular cigarette,'' <PERSON> Blalock </PERSON> said. `` But I felt like on balance it might have worked out. `` The cigarette had potential had it proven to be acceptable by the public because of some of the features that it offered, especially on sidestream smoke and the fire safety issue,'' he said. `` Had that ... been accepted as fully as it potentially might have been, it could have more than offset the amount of tobacco used in the cigarette. `` Anytime somebody in the industry tries something new and it does n't work out, you're a little disappointed because it well could have a positive impact on tobacco growers down the road,'' he said. `` My guess is that they -LRB- RJR -RRB- will continue working on it. It certainly would not make sense for them just to shelve it after all the investment that's been put into it.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Shreveport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, announced a major pipeline expansion Wednesday that will open up markets in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to the prolific <LOCATION> Arkoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Officials said the the project will ultimately mean an extra 450 million cubic feet per day of natural gas can be moved to the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and Northeast. They estimated that would increase the sales of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> gas by $ 300 million. Officials said most of the capacity expansion will come from a new 200-mile pipeline originating in <LOCATION> Latimer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and terminating in <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark </LOCATION>. They said the 30-inch diameter pipeline will provide substantial additional capacity across <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> to the Southeast Mainline of <ORGANIZATION> ANR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Coastal subsidiary. Estimated cost of the new pipeline was set at $ 120 million. Officials said it could be in service by as early as mid-1990. The announcement was made at a news conference attended by <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellmon </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> said officials believe the new pipeline will allow <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> gas to be sold at a competitive price with natural gas from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON> said the first phase of the project will kick off next month. `` From Coastal's prospective, these agreements have three major benefits,'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> said. `` First, we will substantially improve our ability to move gas out of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> by providing greatly expanded transportation and pipeline links between our <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> and Southeast pipeline facilities. `` Second, by using our newly proposed connections in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to the major pipelines serving the Northeast, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> producers will gain direct access to this major growing gas market. `` Third, our <ORGANIZATION> ANR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary will gain access to the increasingly important gas supplies in the <LOCATION> Arkoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basis </LOCATION> to meet the requirements of its customers in the future.'' <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON> said the project allows <ORGANIZATION> Arkla </ORGANIZATION> to strengthen its access to new markets `` while at the same time increasing the efficiency of our existing pipeline system, which will benefit our current customers and producers.'' The extra sales of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> gas will mean an additional $ 21 million in gross production taxes for the state, officials said. Those taxes go principally to the state teacher retirement program.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> is moving to employ a computerized, off-hours trading system for competitive reasons, but its proposed new system will provide a `` significantly improved audit trail'' for regulating its members, the market's chairman said Wednesday. In a 20-minute speech to the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> division of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> within weeks would publicly unveil its proposed electronic auction-market system. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the new computerized trading method would be more than a system for matching orders and claimed it would surpass the <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> trading system being developed by the rival <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` The system to the greatest extent possible replicates the trading pit as we all know it today,'' <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said. The Board of Trade informed its members 2 -LCB- weeks ago that it was planning to implement the computerized system for trading during hours when the market's trading floor is closed. Its purpose then was described as primarily to give foreign investors easier access to the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s increasing market for <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures, members said. Industry observers have said the move into computerized trading by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> appearently was prompted by a widespread federal investigation of suspected fraud at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> indicated Wednesday that market pressures were the primary motivation. `` Knowing that our competitors were developing a computerized trading system, we privately proceeded to develop our own,'' he said. `` If I were president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... and I knew that my neighbor competitor had a nuclear bomb, I would have no alternative but to also develop such a weapon,'' he said. `` I may prefer other strategies to nuclear weapons, and I may not necessarily use them, but I simply can not afford to have the weapon not in my arsenal,'' he said. But <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> also said `` a significantly improved audit trail'' would result from a new electronic order-entry system to allow greater regulation with minimal increased costs to members. Like <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s system is to use a computer to match orders to buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of financial instruments. Also, like <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, the system will be open to other futures exchanges that wish to list their products for trading. But unlike <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, which the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> is developing in partnership with London-based <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, the Board of Trade system is to be developed and owned entirely by the exchange and its members. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> emphasized the differences Wednesday, saying, `` It has become obvious to me, at least, and to the exchange, that the technology used in <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> is outdated, and as that, extremely costly ... to market users.''

 Americans' personal income in January posted its largest gain in more than a year, rising 1.8 percent, but people chose not to spend much of the extra money and instead built up their savings, the government reported Wednesday. Analysts were cautious about whether the report might signal the start of a long-sought slowdown in consumer spending, which would help cool inflationary pressures in the economy, and said the robust income figures suggested continued strength in the economy. On Wall Street, stock prices slumped in late trading, giving up an early gain under the pressure of renewed interest-rate worries. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed with a 15.35-point loss at 2,243.04. Five stocks fell for every four that rose in nationwide trading of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues. Bond prices fell sharply with actively-traded 30-year issues losing $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face value. But the dollar rose broadly in foreign exchange trading. Led by increases in wages and salaries reflecting strong employment gains, income rose $ 74 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.28 trillion in January, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Personal consumption spending, meanwhile, edged up just 0.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 3.35 trillion. The figure includes virtually all consumer spending except interest payments on debt. At the same time, Americans added to their savings at an annual rate of $ 211 billion. With the income gain strongly outpacing the rise in spending, the personal savings rate rose to 5.8 percent from 4.3 percent in December. It was the highest savings rate since May 1985, when Americans set aside 6.5 percent of their disposable income. Analysts found the weak spending figure surprising in light of the strong income growth and were divided about whether it marked the start of a trend toward slower consumer spending. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said the figures were `` welcome news, suggesting that fears of the economy overheating were unfounded.'' But <PERSON> Lea </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>, senior economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm, said it was too early `` to talk about consumers really retrenching.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said that if strong employment figures continue to drive income upward, it could `` raise some concerns about inflation in the coming year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> since last March has been pushing interest rates up in an effort to slow the economy and dampen inflationary pressures. <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has singled out higher wage pressures in the economy as part of the cause of accelerating inflation. Just last week, the central bank boosted its key bank lending rate a half-percentage-point to 7 percent after worries about inflation were heightened by a report that consumer prices shot up 0.6 percent in January. Consumer spending rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual rate last year, a pace that analysts said is too fast given constraints on production caused by high operating rates and tight labor markets. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said January's income and spending report sent mixed signals, with the strong income gain suggesting `` the economy was continuing to race ahead too fast,'' while the spending pace suggests `` a much more restrained pattern'' that would be welcome. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said it was possible that January's weak consumer spending figure may be one of `` the first signs that higher interest rates are taking their toll'' on consumer spending. However, Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said the figures more likely signaled that `` people are better able to save'' after enjoying sustained increases in income over the last year. In another report Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction spending increased 0.4 percent in January, led by a strong increase in work on non-residential buildings and held back by a decrease in work on government projects. Building activity rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 424 billion in January, following a 2.1 percent increase in December and a 1.3 percent jump in November. January's increase in personal income was the biggest monthly increase since a 2 percent jump in October 1987, while the slim rise in spending was the weakest performance since a 1.5 percent decrease in September. The increase in income was paced by a 1.2 percent gain in the key component of wages and salaries, reflecting continued strong employment. The recent income gains were bolstered by several unusual factors, including a 4.1 percent pay raise in January for federal civilian and military personnel, a 4 percent cost-of-living increase in Social Security benefits in January and a December increase in farm subsidy payments, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Even excluding such factors, however, personal income still increased 1.6 percent in January and 0.8 percent in December. Americans' disposable, or after-tax, incomes rose 1.7 percent in January after rising 0.9 percent in December and falling 0.3 percent in November.

 <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Wednesday reported a $ 244 million loss in fourth-quarter earnings, which the telecommunications company attributed to restructuring charges connected with a change of services <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said the fourth-quarter loss compared to a net gain of $ 105 million, or $ 3.99 per share, in 1987's fourth quarter. Sales in the final quarter of 1988 were $ 186.5 million, compared to revenues of $ 190.9 million for the same period of 1987. For the year, the company said it lost $ 1.08 billion on revenues of $ 875.9 million. That compares to a net income of $ 88 million, or $ 2.58 a share, on revenues of $ 801.8 million in 1987, the company said. The restructuring charges went to equipment writeoffs, severance pay and other costs related to the company's transition `` from a facilities-based operator of domestic telecommunications transmission services to its role as an international provider of value-added messaging, financial and other services,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Amman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> will open the first major new rail route in its 18-year history when it begins service to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on May 23, anticipating 1.4 million new riders a year, officials announced Wednesday. The `` <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>,'' more commonly called the `` Gamblers Express,'' will include five round-trips on weekdays and several more round-trips on the weekends, said <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president of marketing. One direct line will originate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and another will start in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> has added new cities and frequencies to its existing rail network, but never before created an entirely new route, said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> has delayed commuter service on the rail line until 1991. NJ Transit officials announced funding cutbacks Tuesday to meet a projected budget deficit. But <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION>'s delay would not affect <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s start `` <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> has been extremely cooperative in getting the physical plant assembled,'' he said. `` Even if they end up postponing their -LRB- commuter -RRB- service for a year, it will not affect our plans.'' Passenger service into the seaside resort was stopped in 1982 because of low ridership and poor track conditions. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NJ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> are sharing costs on the $ 101 million new rail project, including repairing the old tracks and building a new <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> terminal and local stations. <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> expects to bring in revenue of about $ 30 million a year, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Tentative <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> fares include a $ 25 round-trip charge between <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; a $ 49 round-trip from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>; and a $ 46 round-trip from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said.

 A federal judge Wednesday refused to dismiss charges or grant a mistrial in the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock manipulation case and defense lawyers called their first witnesses. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> and its vice chairman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, are charged with securities fraud and other criminal counts in an alleged scheme to manipulate the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock in October 1986. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> denied defense motions to dismiss the charges made Tuesday, finding that `` the government has offered sufficient evidence.'' The judge also denied a defense request to declare a mistrial for the second time. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> declared a mistrial Jan. 10, four weeks into the case, because a prosecutor failed to disclose a report that concluded a major piece of evidence had been altered. After a new jury was selected, the second trial began Feb. 1 with opening arguments at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. Legal and business observers consider the <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> trial significant because it is the first courtroom test of information stemming from the insider trading scandals that rocked Wall Street in the mid-1980s. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based chemicials and building materials manufacturer, two subsidiaries and <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> were accused of orchestrating a scheme to drive up the price of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> before unloading 5 million shares acquired during an unsuccessful takeover attempt. The main prosecution witness was <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, former head of a Los Angeles-based brokerage who struck a plea bargain with prosecutors after being implicated by master insider trader <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who is serving a 3-year prison sentence, did not testify at the trial. After a securities fraud count was dismissed Tuesday, at prosecutors' request, the defense sought to have the remaining eight counts of stock manipulation, conspiracy, securities fraud and wire fraud dismissed. The defense held that the government had n't offered proof of intent to induce investors to but stock. They sought a mistrial on grounds that some of <ORGANIZATION> Jefferies </ORGANIZATION>' testimony, which was contradicted by one of his associates, was hearsay. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> denied the request, however, and defense lawyers for <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> called three character witnesses, including <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherne </PERSON>, a 76-year-old lawyer and official of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which assists political refugees. <PERSON> Cherne </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, had served on the <ORGANIZATION> IRC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee since the early 1970s with `` extraordinary devotion and distinction.'' The count dismissed Tuesday concerned the sale of 5 million shares of Carbide stock in November 1986 to <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The count was considered a complicating factor in an already complex case, but Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> declined to comment on why the government dropped the charge. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said she expected to sequester the jury during their deliberations, expected to begin late next week.

 The cold snap that heavily damaged <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s potatoes and blighted other crops could drive up local vegetable prices and put a crimp in the nation's potato chip supply this spring, officials said Tuesday. The potato chip industry had been counting on an early and abundant supply of potatoes from this area this spring to replinish dwindling stocks, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Willingham </PERSON>, southeastern area field manager for <ORGANIZATION> Frito-Lay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But now the freeze has turned what was expected to be a bonanza into a season of gloom for potato farmers. `` As good as the crop was looking it would work out about right. It was as much as three weeks early,'' <PERSON> Willingham </PERSON> said Monday from his office in nearby <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON>. The 26,000 acres of potatoes St. <PERSON> Johns </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Flagler </LOCATION> counties in northeast <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> fill a niche in the supply of chip potatoes for a few weeks each spring because they come in earlier than other areas. Emergency boards in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Flagler </LOCATION> counties estimated that 10 percent of the potato fields had 100 percent loss, 10 percent had no loss and 80 percent had from 10 to 50 percent loss. In <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, the loss was 50 percent. However, <PERSON> Willingham </PERSON> said he could n't `` envision there not being enough potato chips on the shelves for consumers.'' <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Zant </PERSON> of the Agricultural Stablization and <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION> said the counties have been asked to submit reports that will be sent to the governor's office for a decision on whether damage is sufficient to request federal disaster assistance. `` There is some severe damage. I think the percentage of loss will go higher,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> director for <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Flagler </LOCATION> counties. The attitude among potato farmers has gone `` from optimism to gloom,'' said <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Putnam </PERSON> <PERSON> Countky </PERSON> extension director. The 5,000 acres of potato plants in <LOCATION> Putnam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sustained heavy losses because they had been planted early and were too big to cover with dirt to protect them from the cold, <PERSON> Tilton </PERSON> said.
