<TEXT>
 The tower of <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION> has been leaning for 800 years, so the keeper of the marble wonder ca n't understand what all the latest fuss is about. It's true that experts have been making dire predictions for years. But there was a real tower tizzy after the minister of public works, <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON>, sounded an alarm recently that scared all of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Newspapers immediately published headlines warning of a `` red alert'' for the tower, raising fears that one of the symbols of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> could, at worst, topple, or at best, be closed for repairs. But <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON>, chairman of the committee responsible for preservation of the monument, says there's nothing to get excited about. `` There is absolutely nothing new in the situation,'' he said in an interview. `` To say that the tower is in danger, so what? It's always been in danger. `` What does the tower need?'' <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> added. `` It needs to be left in peace.'' The 180-foot circular tower, begun by <PERSON> Bonnano </PERSON> <PERSON> Pisano </PERSON> in 1173, started to tilt almost immediately because the ground shifted underneath. It was completed by <PERSON> Tomasso </PERSON> d'Andrea with the construction of the belfry between 1360 and 1370. The tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular, but <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> and other tower experts say it would not topple for more than another century if it continues to tilt at its average rate. According to the last measurement in June, the tower leaned an additional 0.008 inches in the last 12-month period. The average yearly tilt since the measurements began in 1918 is 0.047 inches. `` The thing should fall over,'' <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> said, seated behind a desk in his office, the tower visible through Gothic windows. `` How long will this lean last? No one can say. But at a certain time, it will reach the point where it falls. That will take more than 100 years. It could be 200, 250 years.'' For decades, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has tried to come up with ways to save the tower. A number of national and international commissions have proposed plans for stabilizing the monument, but none has ever been implemented. `` The problem of trying to stabilize the tower is enough to make the hands of great technicians tremble,'' said <PERSON> Gero </PERSON> <PERSON> Geri </PERSON>, a topography professor who has been measuring the lean of the tower since 1969. `` Who wants to risk doing something that could upset the equilibrium?'' The latest plan, approved by the government in 1987, is to implant a wheel-shaped support below the base around the tower. It would be connected by concrete spokes to the marble foundation. The <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> appointed a commission a few months ago to study the soil conditions to determine whether the plan can go ahead. But <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> believes the tower ca n't be fixed until officials figure out what has kept the 14,000-ton structure standing all these years. `` All the technicians say it ca n't be understood,'' said the white-haired, 80-year-old retired radiologist who has headed the monument preservation committee for 12 years. `` This means there are special conditions of the terrain which have n't yet been explained. If you ca n't understand this, how can you do a project to save it?'' <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat who has been public works minister for barely two months, apparently wants to find a solution. After expressing his concern over the state of the tower, <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON> ordered a panel of technical experts to report back quickly on the feasibility of a stabilization plan. He also told them to devise a round-the-clock monitoring system for the tower. Mayor <PERSON> Giacomino </PERSON> <PERSON> Granchi </PERSON>, a Socialist, accused <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON> of exaggerating the situation and trying to get publicity for himself. <PERSON> Prandini </PERSON> replied, `` I do n't see why one wants to make a controversy out of a well known problem only because there's the will to act decisively and go from the study phase to concrete realization.'' The sense of urgency was heightened by the collapse in March of the 900-year-old tower of <LOCATION> Pavia </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, killing three people. Experts said the 255-foot tower crumbled either because of natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or because of a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the water table. `` The example of <LOCATION> Pavia </LOCATION> does n't count because no one ever monitored it,'' <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> said. `` No other tower in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is monitored like <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>'s. If <PERSON> Pavia </PERSON> had all the instruments that we have, they would have known a few months before'' that it was in danger. <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> said he receives an average of 40 proposals a year from people around the world, mostly Americans, for saving the tower. The latest: erecting a huge statue of Saint <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pisa </LOCATION>'s patron saint, with arms raised to hold up the tower Some even suggest trying to straighten the tower, a notion that makes <PERSON> Toniolo </PERSON> shudder. `` Never, for heaven's sake,'' he said. `` It was born tilted. Our ancestors built it that way eight centuries ago. It must remain that way.''

<TEXT>
 As <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s first snowfall ushered in an early winter last week, Soviet officials worried openly that the nation could face dangerous shortages of food, fuel and heat in the colder weeks and months to come. Attention focused on a breakdown of the transportation network as supplies of every kind bottlenecked at railheads and ports throughout much of the country. But the looming threat also exposes President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s inability so far to implement any real `` perestroika,'' or restructuring, of the Soviet economy. After four years of reform measures, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has succeeded in discrediting the old system built around a centrally planned economy. But he has n't instituted the market-driven replacement that he and other reformers advocate. The result is most evident right now, in the dislocation of the supply and transport system. First Deputy Premier <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> said last week that power stations and public utilities have 4.5 million fewer tons of coal on hand than at this time last year. He said miners will have to make an enormous effort if the people are to avoid rationing of heat, light and electricity this winter. A three-week national coal miners' strike in July disrupted production, and since then shipments have been held up by the logjams that also affect food and consumer products. <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> blamed the transport breakdown for frustrating the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s effort to relieve chronic shortages by spending tens of millions of precious dollars to import goods the Soviets themselves have failed to produce. More than 2 million tons of imported cargo are sitting in Soviet ports waiting to be unloaded, he said, and 130 loaded freight trains are standing idle inside <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> ready to leave for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Newspapers report carloads of food rotting on trains while consumers complain bitterly that store shelves are empty. The situation is even more critical in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, which for two months was all but cut off from the rest of the country by an Azerbaijani blockade inspired by ancient ethnic hatreds. <PERSON> Voronin </PERSON> charged that outright sabotage is playing havoc with government efforts to rebuild towns and cities destroyed by the December 1988 earthquake before winter comes again. In an article Wednesday in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Sotsialisticheskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriya </ORGANIZATION>, the first deputy premier was quoted as saying that water has been poured into rail cars carrying cement to the quake zone, and building materials have been damaged. Thousands of tons of fuel have not been delivered, he said, and even emergency vehicles have been sidelined in the hard-hit republic. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported Friday night that some rail traffic bound for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> had been under escort by soldiers. But it said disruption on main rail lines caused by the Azerbaijani blockade had idled some 400 trains totaling 60,000 wagons. Pravda, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, reported that across the country there are 13,500 freight cars waiting to be unloaded. In a brief front-page article headlined `` Is It Sabotage?'' the national newspaper said Friday that railway officials were complaining there were no trucks to deliver goods arriving by train. `` Pravda correspondents saw with their own eyes unloaded freight trains that had brought to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> imported furniture, cosmetics, coffee, tea, soap, shampoo, washing powder and Soviet-produced TV sets, refrigerators, batteries and cigarettes _ all in all, 585 cars ready to be unloaded and 700 more waiting at stations from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>'' about 200 miles away, the newspaper said. `` More goods are stored in depots or right outside without anything to protect them from the weather,'' it said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, trying to prevent the situation from deteriorating further, called for a 15-month ban on strikes, saying strong medicine is needed to prevent `` anarchy and irresponsible management.'' The recently elected Supreme Soviet legislature, declaring its independence from <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> edicts, refused to give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the sweeping ban he wanted. But it did temporarily order workers in critical industries such as coal mining to remain on the job until legislation can be adopted defining their right to strike.

<DATELINE>MALAKAL, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Matchstick-thin, naked children with swollen bellies stand under a harsh sun, chewing dried, uncooked fish. Their emaciated elders sit with blank stares, gazing toward the horizon. Half the 50,000 people living in this wretched Nile riverport are seeking shelter in <LOCATION> Malakal </LOCATION> from the horrors of a seemingly interminable civil war, refugees in their own country. Sanitary services are non-existent, and malaria and typhoid run rampant. Those who are sick have but one dilapidated hospital to turn to, with only a handful of doctors and almost no medical supplies. <LOCATION> Malakal </LOCATION>, capital of the southern <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> region, is a microcosm of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s southland, an area the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> laid waste by 6 -LCB- years of warfare and famine. A massive international relief operation prevented a repeat of the mass starvation experienced in the summer of 1988. But the rebellion's accumulated effects continue to wreak havoc on the region's desperate civilians. Government troops control <LOCATION> Malakal </LOCATION>, 425 miles south of the capital, <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>, as they do most southern population centers. Nevertheless, rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> stake out areas on its perimeter as freely as they move about in more than 90 percent of the southern countryside. Militarily, the war has basically been at a standstill for months. Both sides agreed in April to quiet their guns to let relief goods go through. A military junta took power in <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> June 30, promising to end the war, and has extended the truce each month. The rebels have gone along. But political maneuvering over how and when to talk peace continues, leaving the people of <LOCATION> Malakal </LOCATION> and the rest of the south struggling, but surviving. `` People may think we're all dead,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Maker </PERSON>, a government employee, `` but we're still living, despite the war.'' A chieftain of the Shuluk tribe told a visiting reporter: `` Life is going on here. We are life. We are giving birth, and we are eating. Although very little.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says 250,000 southerners died a year ago of starvation or disease in a famine caused by the war. Other Western relief workers estimate the death toll at twice that. To prevent a recurrence, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies organized Operation Lifeline <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> to position 105,000 tons of relief goods in key transit points for distribution to displaced people after monsoon-like summer rains isolated them this year. Organizers say 80 percent of the goods was positioned in time. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, regional monitor of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, said government and rebels are negotiating the dispatch of a third convoy of <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> barges with additional relief for the Upper Nile. The program has had to overcome logistical and political problems, he said. There were too few workers for unloading the barges en route and inadequate storage facilities. Local officials complained about unfair distribution. As displaced people flooded the towns, the numbers of people who had to be cared for kept changing. <LOCATION> Malakal </LOCATION> still faces life-threatening problems, especially in health care. `` Malaria and typhoid are everywhere, and we have no chloroquine -LRB- malaria medicine -RRB- or syringes,'' said Lt. Col. <PERSON> Galwak </PERSON> <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, military governor for the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nile </LOCATION>. `` We have only one general practitioner, when we need at least 24. We have some 500 -LRB- doses -RRB- of medication, which would be consumed in one day if we were to use them, but we have more than 600 patients coming in every day.'' Doctors and nurses said the town's lone hospital has 14 badly equipped wards with about 500 beds. Hospital records show at least two deaths a day from malaria or typhoid. Hospital staff are helped by three doctors of the French organization <ORGANIZATION> Medicins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontieres </ORGANIZATION> and some military doctors. `` These deaths are only the ones in the hospital,'' said one of the French physicians, who identified himself as Dr. <PERSON> Pathot </PERSON>. `` We have no car at all, nor an ambulance, so if somebody is going to die, he may do it before coming to us. `` We ca n't say how many die every day.'' As the civilian populace struggles to survive, the army has been trying to reopen the town's 10 schools, closed for almost three years. Two primary schools have been reopened. A reporter touring them found the classes had no desks, stools or blackboards. Children sat on the ground, their teachers instructing them to read and write by using the earth as a blackboard and a stick as chalk.

 A group of 47 disabled guerrillas left late Saturday for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> under protection of the Mexican government and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, government and airport officials said. The 47, mostly amputees, belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. They occupied the capital's Metropolitan Cathedral for six weeks then on Tuesday moved into the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in their efforts to leave the country. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement the group, accompanied by two nurses, was headed for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The statement said the group `` left tonight on a special <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> flight for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where they have asked to be taken to receive special medical attention.'' Officials at <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s international airport said the 47 left on a plane chartered by the Mexican government. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> or Salvadoran government would not speak to reporters Saturday. The guerrillas also were told not to speak to the press. But one guerrilla, identified only as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, told reporters, `` We're going to leave for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, who lost a leg in combat, said the group hoped to receive medical care in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. It could not be determined whether the disabled men, most of them young, received political asylum in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. Monsignor <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON>, the archbishop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, called the evacuation, `` one of the points of humanization in the conflict.'' Late last month, <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> <PERSON> Damas </PERSON> appealed for the guerrillas to vacate his church, saying: `` The cathedral is not a hotel.'' <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s government said 2,000 soldiers, 500 guerrillas and 700 civilians have been disabled in combat during the more than nine years of civil war.

 A plan to improve and expand <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s highways won solid approval from voters, but proposals to enhance blacks' voting power in electing judges were rejected in Saturday's statewide None of the 13 state amendments to the state constitution on the ballot drew much organized opposition. The only extensive campaigns were for passage of the highway plan; a proposal to make it easier for police to confiscate the property of suspected drug dealers and a measure to set aside at least $ 5 million a year in state mineral revenue to restore eroding wetlands. The drug confiscation and wetlands issues both passed easily. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>, who included the highway funding plan as part of a tax revision package that voters rejected April 29, said it would boost efforts to attract new industry to <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and create thousands of construction jobs. With about 94 percent of the votes counted, the amendment had the support of 430,791 voters, or 71 percent, and was opposed by 174,528, or 29 percent. The proposal would put the state's 16-cent motor fuel tax into a trust fund to be used solely for highways and public works projects. It included a 4-cent gasoline tax increase to finance $ 1.4 billion in transportation improvements, including four lanes for major highways and expansion of ports and airports. The two judicial amendments _ defeated by 3-to-1 margins _ would have added a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice and a majority black district in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> area, and created up to 35 black-majority sub-districts for district and appellate courts. The civil rights challenges that prompted the amendments came about because there are no blacks on the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, only one black among the state's 52 appellate court judges, and five black district court judges out of 192. Several tax-related amendments also were on the ballot, including measures to raise the automobile license plate fee; to allow cities and towns to raise property taxes; and to extend from five years to 10 years the current property tax assessment freeze for owners who expand or improve buildings in certain districts.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> appealed Sunday for an end to ideological divisions worldwide and said the bitter struggle that divides north and south <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> symbolized suffering. `` East is divided from west, north from south,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said at an open air mass attended by 700,000. He appealed for the world to give up mistrust, hostility and conflict `` to live in peace and brotherhood.'' `` The Korean nation is symbolic of a world divided and not yet able to become one in peace and justice,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said, speaking alternately in Korean and English. The vast crowd, many of whom had lined up before dawn, waved white Korean flags and some wept as the pope entered an immense plaza for the mass. Hundreds of singers burst into hymn as the pope walked along a red carpet toward a four-story stage and altar, tiered with thousands of red, white, yellow and pink flowers and flanked by colorful banners. Plain-clothed South Korean security agents carrying submachine guns ringed the stage, and 11,000 police were deployed on the outskirts of the plaza. Those who attended the mass had to pass through metal detectors. About 2,000 priests, aided by 2,000 women in traditional Korean gowns, served communion, while 1,200 white doves were released as a sign of peace. At an earlier meeting with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, the pope asked the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader to make every effort to achieve full democracy and eradicate the nation's legacy of authoritarian rule, a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Koreans </ORGANIZATION> want full democratic rights and freedoms, the spokesman said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> began his <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> pilgrimage in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Saturday. About 1,000 dissidents and radical students staged an anti-government rally at <ORGANIZATION> Sogang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to urge the pope to speak out on human rights abuses in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. An equal number of riot police surrounded the campus, but made no move to halt Saturday's protest. The students dispersed peacefully after demanding the release of jailed dissidents, including South Korean clergymen charged with visiting <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> for unification talks. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> after for the first time flying across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and sending greetings to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a sign of remarkably improved Vatican-Soviet relations. He expressed hope he would soon visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He immediately took up the issue of Korean reunification, which has divided the influential <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Addressing himself to the `` dear people of <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said: `` In the face of the tragic division which continues to separate your own people, do you not have the urgent mission to prove to a world torn by mistrust, strife and hatred that mankind does have the resources to end division and war, and to forge an enduring peace?'' The <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, divided in 1945, is the site of one of the world's most bitter ideological confrontations. The capitalist South and the totalitarian North, which fought to a bloody stalemate in the Korean War, clash frequently and maintain huge armies along their 150-mile border. They still are technically at war since no peace treaty was signed at the end of the Korean War in 1953. A heated debate broke out in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community after a dissident priest visited <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in July to escort home a radical college student. The two claimed the trip was to promote reunification, but the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government called it an illegal contact with an enemy state. The priest and student were arrested when they crossed back across the border. Three other priests were jailed for organizing the priest's trip without government approval. After <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, the pope travels on to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, and then to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. He is to return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> Oct. 16. The trip is the Polish-born <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s 44th foreign pilgrimage.

 A Burmese student group Sunday said the demands of two Burmese hijackers that democracy be returned to their homeland were `` identical to those of the people of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>.'' `` We regard this -LRB- hijacking -RRB- as a reaction to the current situation in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> where freedom of speech is totally impossible,'' said a press release from the <ORGANIZATION> All </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> said it would not repatriate the students, who hijacked a Burmese domestic flight with 83 others aboard then threatened to blow up the plane if their demands for reform were not met. The Front is the major representative of students who fled central <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> to fight for democracy from camps along the country's borders after the military brutally crushed a student-led uprising there last year It claims that nearly 5,000 students and other dissidents are living in 24 frontier camps under the protection of various ethnic minority groups also battling the military-led government. `` Their demands are identical to those of the people of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, and these are the demands we have been relaying the world with our tears and blood since the brutal military takeover in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>,'' said the release, seen in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. An official media report from <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> Sunday said the hijacking was settled successfully because of good relations between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. A Radio Rangoon broadcast gave details of the hijacking Friday by the students, who diverted a <ORGANIZATION> Fokker </ORGANIZATION> 28 domestic airliner to <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and held 83 people hostage for about 10 hours before surrendering to <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials. The students are being held in military custody, but <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials have said they would not be repatriated. `` We will not hurt them. They will not be sent back to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>,'' Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Tienchai </PERSON> <PERSON> Sirisunpan </PERSON> said in a news conference. `` The Burmese government also does not want them back. So far they have not asked for asylum in any country.'' Although <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has friendly relations with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, it does not have an extradition treaty with the military government in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. `` As I understand it, they want to let the world know what has happened in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, especially the life without freedom of <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> citizens,'' <PERSON> Tienchai </PERSON> said. The hijackers demands included the release of political prisoners, lifting of martial law, freedom of the press and the formation of an interim government with persons nominated by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the radio broadcast said. The hijackers also wanted the release of opposition leader <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, the `` governing of the people leniently'' and `` ordering soldiers back to the barracks.'' A military junta seized power in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> in September 1988 following a nationwide uprising to demand an end to a quarter century of authoritarian rule. The military has promised general elections next year, but in July placed under house arrest its leading opponent, <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, and has arrested several thousand other dissidents, according to Western sources. The two students initially threatened to blow up the aircraft with what <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> officials say was a homemade explosive. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is one of the few nations which has tried to establish friendly ties with the military regime and has shown particular interest in exploiting <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s rich natural resources, including teak and fish. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s powerful military has been at the forefront of efforts to develop closer ties.

 East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> told Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Saturday he would stick to his hard-line course as police battled thousands demonstrating for reform on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary. Scores were arrested and dozens injured by police who punched, kicked, beat and dragged away protesters in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and at least three other cities, witnesses and television reports said. One Western journalist reportedly was detained. An estimated 10,000 people joined the protests. Some 5,000 demonstrators, many shouting `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>,'' crowded into the Alexanderplatz square in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> late Saturday. The Soviet leader, whose reform policies have made him a hero to many East Germans, ended his two-day visit Saturday evening and headed back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Plainclothes police and uniformed riot officers used force to disperse the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> demonstrators. Police bashed one man's head against a wall. Other protesters were kicked by security police, dragged along the ground to side streets and taken away to jails. Some <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> residents watched the violence from apartment windows. They waved sparklers to show support for the demonstrators. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>, a reporter for the British newspaper Observer, earlier said authorities detained three Western journalists. But a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> later said only <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> of the Sunday Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was held. The report could not be confirmed with East German authorities. In the most widespread protests to hit <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in years, clashes also were reported in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>. Also Saturday, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said there were signs <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would ease emigration restrictions. A West German newspaper said the plans were intended to clear out those who have criticized conditions in their Communist homeland. The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans has deeply embarrassed the aging leadership in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> during weekend anniversary celebrations. However, the official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said that in three hours of talks, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Gorbachev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will adhere to `` the basic values'' of socialism. `` The hopes of bourgeois politicians and ideologues who are aiming for reforms heading to bourgeois democracy and on to capitalism are built on sand,'' <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will consistently follow the proven course for the good of the people, in the unity of economic and social policies, continuity and renewal,'' he said. While making clear his aims for communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> also expressed support for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s reforms. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the meeting took place in an atmosphere of `` traditional friendship.'' A day earlier, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> urged <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to work with `` all forces in society.'' <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeated to <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> saying that `` he who is late is punished.'' Asked whether that referred to the East German government's repeated rejection of reforms, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said: `` No, we were talking about our experiences But journalists do interpret things.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the issue of the refugee exodus did not come up in the session he attended, the second of two. About 4,000 protesters battled police Saturday in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, according to witnesses and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network. The witnesses said there were numerous injuries and arrests but it was not clear how many. Police, carrying truncheons and wearing riot helmets and shields, waded into the crowd of protesters and beat them at random, witnesses said. Groups of 10 to 15 policemen were seen chasing demonstrators, who offered no resistance but shouted `` No violence,'' `` Shame on you'' and `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>!'' the witnesses said. About 2,000 demonstrators battled police and soldiers overnight in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and an unspecified number were injured, witnesses said. It was the fourth night of violence in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>. Hundreds of police officers attacked the demonstrators, who responded by hurling bottles and other objects, witnesses said. They said the street battles lasted for several hours. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said Saturday in a TV interview there were signals <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was about to ease emigration restrictions for its citizens. The West German <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonntag </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> was planning `` a massive expulsion of annoying citizens.' It is thought that more than a million people have asked to leave <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, although the government has not provided any statistics. Western tourists were barred from <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for a third day. New barriers were put up overnight at the Checkpoint Charlie crossing. A disturbance broke out at the checkpoint Saturday when a man with a crowbar hacked and hammered at the new metal barriers from the Western side. A crowd of about 200 people on the western side taunted East German guards watching the disturbance, and pelted them with pieces of metal, cans and clumps of dirt. The guards did not react. Tanks, rocket transporters and goose-stepping East German soldiers paraded down <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Karl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boulevard </ORGANIZATION> early Saturday in a celebration of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s founding on Oct. 7, 1949. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> observed the military display. The military nature of the parade drew a protest from Western allies <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, who called it a `` provocation as well as a violation of the city's demilitarized status.'' ADN said the parade showed the country's determination `` to always protect what the workers have produced in four decades.'' But the government had difficulty portraying the nation as a socialist success. More than 47,000 people have fled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since mid-September, across <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s western border or through West German embassies in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Many have complained of repression and a low standard of living. Bavarian border police said Saturday that 662 East German refugees arrived in the West German state over the past 24 hours, all through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> opened the border Sept. 11.

 A Mirage 2000 fighter jet crashed and exploded Sunday during a final acrobatic maneuver on Indian Air Force Day, killing the pilot who had attempted an extra roll, officials said. No one on the ground was killed, but some of the 2,000 spectators suffered sprained ankles or bruises running to or from the site, they said. The silver delta-winged aircraft of French design was completing a climb known as a `` Vertical Charlie'' when it plunged to the ground about 300 yards from a reviewing stand at <LOCATION> Palam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Military and civilian dignitaries, journalists and other guests had watched the parade of 650 enlisted men and an aerial display. The pilot, identified as Wing Commander <PERSON> Ramesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, the 39-year-old commander of the Mirage squadron, was killed instantly, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Chief Marshal S.K. <PERSON> Mehra </PERSON> said. He told reporters the accident apparently was caused by `` an error in judgment.'' <PERSON> Mehra </PERSON> said the sky was hazy and may have disoriented <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>. The plane was about 18 feet from the ground when the pilot tried the maneuver, he said. The Mirage was completing the final flyby during the parade marking the 57th anniversary of the Indian air force and honoring its 115,000 officers. Air Marshal <PERSON> N.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Suri </PERSON>, vice chief of the air staff, said <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> was only supposed to perform three rolls in the finale. Instead, the officer said, he attempted four. The plane made a steep climb, then descended making three loops and rolls, he said. After failing to complete a fourth roll, the pilot was unable to pull out of the descent and the plane hurtled to the ground, he said. Some spectators gasped and several air force wives ran toward the burning wreckage. The aircraft slammed into the ground, exploded and bounced three times through fuel tanks, igniting a huge fireball. Several vehicles parked in the area were badily damaged by the burning chunks. The Mirage is capable of flying up to 1,460 miles an hour at an altitude of 65,600 feet. The Indian air force bought 49 Mirage 2000 planes between 1982 and 1986.

 Tamil guerrillas abducted 18 journalists from their newspaper office and said they would be put to work on a new Tamil publication, a reporter who fled during the raid said Sunday. The armed militants burst into the <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> offices of <LOCATION> Eelanadu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s oldest Tamil language newspaper, on Thursday, the journalist said in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. He said he was one of five reporters who bolted to freedom before the abductors drove away with the reporters. The journalist asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety. `` I want to go back to <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION> and my newspaper,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> office of Eelanadu, which means <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> in Tamil, confirmed the attack but gave no details. The journalist said the gunmen belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which is supported by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and opposes the largest Tamil militia, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>. According to the journalist, the abductors said they were going to publish a new newspaper called <PERSON> Viduthalai </PERSON>, which means liberation in the Tamil language. He has provided reliable information in the past. The <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> are fighting Indian peacekeeping troops sent to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> to disarm them in 1987. The Liberation Front and other Tamil militants accepted the Indian-brokered peace plan. The Front and the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> once jointly sought independence for the Tamil minority in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, where the government and military are dominated by the Sinhalese majority. The ethnic violence in Tamil-dominated northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> has claimed more than 11,000 lives in the past six years. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> closed Eelanadu and two other Tamil newspapers in <LOCATION> Jaffna </LOCATION>, 180 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, on Sept. 20 after the publications carried paid advertisements commemorating the second anniversary of the death of a Tiger rebel leader. In February, the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> blew up <PERSON> Eelanadu </PERSON>'s offices after the newspaper carried stories that the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> considered pro-Indian. Eelanadu, which was founded 30 years ago and has a circulation of 10,000, resumed publication in May with a skeleton staff.

 Rickshaw drivers struck for eight hours Sunday to protest traffic rules, and police patrolled the city to prevent violence. Most motorists stayed off the streets fearing unrest, but none was reported. Government offices remained open, staffed by employees who were able to walk to work. Privately owned banks and businesses shut down. The bicycle-powered rickshaws are the most common form of transportation in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million people. The drivers were protesting efforts to outlaw unlicensed rickshaws. Only about a third of the capital's 100,000 rickshaws are licensed. The strikers also protested a rule barring them from certain streets, including one running past <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>'s two luxury hotels. The ban forces them to pedal a mile or more out of their way to reach their passengers' destinations. About 200,000 men and their families depend on rickshaws for their livelihood.

In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, businesses were closed by a general strike, the first of a three-day shutdown ordered by the uprising's PLO-backed underground leaders to step up the revolt against Israeli rule of the lands.

The center-left <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>'s partner in the coalition government, urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s offer. But the policy-making inner Cabinet vote produced a 6-6 tie along political lines, which amounted to a rejection of the Egyptian offer. <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> school principal and another reported choice of <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> for the talks, said he was shocked that <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s offer was rejected. `` The decision will bring waves of violence and extremism,'' <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON> said. `` The blame is on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayyash </PERSON> predicted more violence in the Palestinian uprising if there were no progress toward peace. The revolt, which begins its 23rd month Monday, already has led to the deaths of 585 Palestinians and 40 Israelis. `` Palestinian moderation has its limits. If there is no achievement, then our people will go back to extremism,'' <PERSON> Saftawi </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. Members of Likud maintained, meanwhile, that the inner Cabinet vote did not halt progress toward peace. `` The peace process ... does not depend on one vote in the Cabinet,'' said <PERSON> Ehud </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, the minister in charge of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> affairs. He told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that the government could still agree to meet a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation if the members were acceptable to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. His Likud colleague, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, blamed last week's rejection on the `` stubbornness'' of Labor in forcing a vote on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal. He said the vote should have been put off until after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> received an expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to assist in forming a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation to the peace talks. But <PERSON> Shahal </PERSON>, energy minister in the coalition <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> never requested a delay and came to Friday's meeting with only a vague notion of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might propose. `` If there is an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> proposal, which we have n't heard explicitly from the foreign minister ... this could rescue the political situation,'' he said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, speaking on the radio in a Yom Kippur address, called Israelis `` seekers of peace'' but said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has survived only through armed might. `` The army ... has proved to our enemies and the whole world that it is impossible to defeat us,'' he said.

 When then-House <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON> asked for help from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in June 1985, an agency official asked <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> whether he should get it. `` Absolutely!!!'' was her short, but emphatic, answer. And when Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> wrote <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> about a problem in his state not long before an important vote, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> swung into action. `` This looks like trouble,'' she wrote an aide. `` We need <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> too much. ... Please call him, tell him that we'll do whatever we can.'' But when <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> wanted her boss, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, to accompany him to a housing project devastated by a hurricane, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> frowned at the request. `` Respectfully decline,'' she wrote. Those episodes, detailed in more than 20,000 pages of <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s files, are but three of hundreds of glimpses of the politics of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, and of the power <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> held as <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s close aide <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who had no experience in housing and only a brief stint in government before coming to work at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, is a central figure in the congressional investigation of favoritism and mismanagement at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. Like <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, she has refused to testify by citing her right against self-incrimination. Her files show she was also a central figure in agency affairs, keeping <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> apprised of important developments, endorsing projects she liked and cracking down on work that did n't satisfy her. `` You all must bear down _ no more garbage for -LRB- <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s -RRB- signature,'' she said in a July 1985 note to three <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who worked on a letter for <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` He deserves better work from his assistants. Review my notes and do four Hail <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>'s.'' When a request from someone who could help <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> _ like <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION>, whose committee controlled the agency's budget _ reached <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s desk, she made sure it was handled quickly, often sending critical notes to aides who had not responded to the requests sooner. She was just as keenly aware of the other side of the political fence, rejecting <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> appearances with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and another prominent black, South African Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, both of whom had major differences with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Her files, released last week under the Freedom of Information Act, show she was swamped with requests for help from developers, consultants, local housing officials, city councilors and mayors, and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. For some, she arranged meetings or telephone conversations with <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. For others, she made sure their proposals were routed to the proper agency official, sometimes adding her endorsement. `` Please give these people all the help you can,'' she wrote to a deputy when sending him a proposal for a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> grant, which was later approved. On occasion, she even delved into the realm of social director _ securing <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tour passes for then-Columbus, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> Councilor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> in 1983 and an invitation to a dinner in honor of former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> for one of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s former law partners in 1985. `` My family and I enjoyed the tour very much,'' <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> said in a thank-you note to <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. Although she wrote flowery letters to some of the most powerful people in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> took a jab at many of them in a note to an aide who had sent her a copy of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s magazine's 1985 list of the capital's `` Social 400,'' which did not bear her name `` With the exception of <ORGANIZATION> Ron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> & amp; <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> -RRB-, I would n't be seen with any of them!'' she wrote. Among others on the list: <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Cabinet secretaries <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, several <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices and dozens of senators and representatives, not to mention the richest of the rich. Her notes also show signs of the sense of humor friends and colleagues often recall. `` Ba Humbug! I'm not giving back anything!'' she scribbled on a memo detailing policy against accepting gifts from government vendors. She also was fiercely protective of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, keeping a close eye on HUD-related news accounts and once warning a public affairs aide not to include in an internal newsletter some derogatory questions employees had submitted for <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. Among them: `` Why do you stay in a job that you wanted to leave after the election when the president is attempting to eliminate your key programs?'' and `` Would you like to live out the rest of your life in a deregulated nursing home?'' When she sent a copy of the questions to <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, she scribbled one of her frequent one-word notes: `` Incredible!''

<HEAD>From Alpha to Omega, Fraternities Debate Merits of Pledging</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An anti-hazing campaign aimed at countering the image of Greek rows as gin-soaked `` Animal Houses'' appears to be gaining this fall on campuses from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>. Worried by their image, as well as the possibility of lawsuits, fraternities around the country are moving to eliminate hazing. Some want to eliminate pledging, the practice of having a period between the recruitment of a member and his formal initiation when hazing is most likely. In August, two of the nation's largest fraternities, <PERSON> Tau </PERSON> <PERSON> Kappa </PERSON> <PERSON> Epsilon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Zeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tau </ORGANIZATION>, decided that the most effective way to end hazing was to ban pledging altogether in their chapters. <PERSON> Kappa </PERSON> <PERSON> Delta </PERSON> <PERSON> Rho </PERSON> also approved a long-range plan that includes a move to no pledging by 1995. Phi Sigma Kappa amended its constitution to allow for experimentation with non-pledge programs. Alpha Epsilon Pi introduced new membership education programs. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interfraternity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which represents fraternities at 900 college campuses, weighed in with an anti-hazing campaign of its own in September, stressing that the image of fraternities everywhere was suffering from hazing incidents that harmed pledges physically or psychologically. `` It's not a concern for decreasing membership,'' said <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brant </PERSON>, executive director of the Indianapolis-based council. `` We're just really fed up with the perception that silly and dangerous things occur on the college campus, and fraternities are sometimes associated with those things.'' `` What has empowered us in making our case to fraternities is that we are painfully aware that the stakes have been raised in legal liability,'' <PERSON> Brant </PERSON> said. Fraternity brothers on many campuses still resist the idea of ditching the time-honored practice of putting new members through physical or mental ordeals before their formal initiation, despite excesses that have led to 40 deaths and hundreds of injuries in the last decade nationwide. `` I really do n't think you can form any sort of loyalty to a house without pledging,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Colafella </PERSON>, a sophomore initiated last month into <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The oneness that you show with the brotherhood, the thing you have in common, is the trials and tribulations that got you there.'' Some 400,000 undergraduate men and 250,000 undergraduate women belong to Greek organizations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. After a slump in membership from 1965 through the 1970s, Greek organizations have grown steadily over the last decade. Hazing has continued at some campuses this fall, including one notorious case at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>, where Beta Theta Pi pledges were abandoned bound and naked last month on the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Rust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly black school, with `` KKK'' and a racist epithet painted on their chests. But many fraternities are looking for better ways to initiate members. At <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION>, for example, Theta Xi is dropping pledging this fall and will instead require candidates to complete educational programs to acquaint them with active members and the mores of the house. <ORGANIZATION> Phi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sigma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> will scrap pledging and replace it with four weeks of informal rushing, said chapter president <PERSON> Darrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoyama </PERSON>. The house is recruiting prospective members by making friends and inviting them to the chapter. Those who decide to rush have to pass a test on the fraternity's traditions, history and rules. `` I think it's a lot more positive,'' <PERSON> Aoyama </PERSON> said. `` How can you expect the person to be your friend after you treat him like dirt?'' But Tau Kappa Epsilon member <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Koh </PERSON>, whose fraternity will abolish pledging in two years, said: `` The most disgusting thing in the world is to get rid of pledging. It no longer becomes a fraternity, it becomes a club. If you ask anybody, their pledge semester was the funnest.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION>, where 28 percent of the 16,000 undergraduates belong to one of 46 Greek organizations, ZBT President <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said his group is following the anti-pledging program this fall as laid out in a 400-page manual issued by the national fraternity. But some brothers do n't understand why they ca n't do the same things that were done to them as pledges, he said. The chapter has about 100 members. `` It's like if you've been swinging a golf club one way all your life and all of a sudden this guy comes up to you and he says you're doing it wrong and you have to change,'' <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said. `` You're going to have trouble changing your swing. At <ORGANIZATION> Tulane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, where 32 percent of male and 40 percent of female undergraduates belong to Greek organizations, ZBT President <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Randman </PERSON> said the no-pledge rule is `` just about the only way a fraternity can go these days.'' The tighter rules, he added, spare him from `` looking over my shoulder and worrying as much as I might have been in the past when people had been able to run pretty much free.'' <PERSON> Randman </PERSON> said the pledge semester has been replaced with a four-week educational period during which older members work to make the freshmen part of the group and a cohesive class unto themselves. `` Since my freshman year it has changed a lot,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Switek </PERSON>, a senior and president of <ORGANIZATION> Bones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fraternity </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest at <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION>, where 58 percent of undergraduates join fraternities or sororities. Now, school officials insist that such organizations give details of their rush plans. `` A lot of people thought what they had to go through was humiliating and did n't want others to have to go through the same thing,'' <PERSON> Switek </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Israelis Pray and Fast On Day of Atonement</HEAD>

 As night fell Sunday, Jews throughout <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> marked the start of their holiest day, Yom Kippur, with fasting and prayers of penitence. Traffic on the nation's highways and streets came to a halt, commercial flights were suspended and the border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and bridges to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> were closed. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> and television and the army radio ceased broadcasts, leaving the country without communications for the solemn holiday, which ends at sundown Monday. Although most Israelis are secular, Yom Kippur is widely observed and many flock to the nation's almost 8,000 synagogues for prayer services. It is traditional for Jews to refrain from taking food and water during the 24-hour holiday. Jews beg God for forgiveness and pray for life and peace during Yom Kippur, also known as the `` Day of Atonement.'' It is traditional for men to wear a white robe, called a kitle, symbolizing purity, during holiday services and to refrain from wearing leather shoes as a symbol of humility. Israeli families often take advantage of the quiet by walking down major roadways to synagogues. In past years, cars that ventured out on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> streets were sometimes stoned by religous zealots. Appeals were broadcast on the radio to allow ambulances to pass freely. Tens of thousands of Jews traditionally gather at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site. The wall is the last remnant of the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D. Many Jews spend the entire 24-hour fast day praying at the site. Early Sunday, some orthodox Jews went to markets to carry out the ancient rite of kapparot. Waving live chickens over their head, they prayed that their sins would be transferred to the sacrificial chicken. Afterward, the chickens were slaughtered and given to the poor. Yom Kippur ends the 10 `` Days of Awe'' that begin on <PERSON> Rosh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashana </PERSON>, the Jewish New Year. Jews believe that during the period God decides each person's destiny over the next year. The Days of Awe are traditionally filled with prayer, and many Jews greet each other by saying `` May you be inscribed in the Book of Life.'' This Yom Kippur marked the 16th anniversary of the 1973 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, which began when Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a suprise attack on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Fierce battles were fought on the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> and in the Sinai desert and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> armies briefly threatened to invade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> itself. Every year at this time, bereaved families lay wreaths and flowers at the gravesites of the almost 3,000 Israeli troops who fell in the war. Israeli newspapers on Sunday printed reminiscences and commentaries about the war, and many families placed notices in newspapers memorializing relatives who died as soldiers. One of the first communal settlements in the country, <PERSON> Kibbutz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizra </PERSON>, put an ad in several papers listing seven members ages 19 to 48 who were killed in the war. `` Nearly everyone had a close friend or relative that was killed,'' said kibbutz secretary <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenbald </PERSON>. `` Until today, we have still not recovered.'' In a special broadcast to the nation, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> paid tribute to those who fell. To prevent a repeat of the suprise attack and halt any guerrilla infiltrations, the military placed forces on high alert Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> began a three-day strike to coincide with Yom Kippur and step up the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule of the territories. Monday marks the beginning of the 23rd month of the rebellion. The army announced Saturday that travel between the occupied lands and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be barred during the holiday.

 A fighter jet crashed and exploded in a giant fireball at ceremonies honoring the Indian air force Sunday after the pilot apparently misjudged the plane's altitude and tried an extra acrobatic maneuver, officials said. About 2,000 military and civilian dignitaries, journalists and other guests watched in horror as the French-designed Mirage 2000 plunged to earth about 300 yards from a reviewing stand, killing the pilot. No one on the ground was killed. Some spectators suffered sprained ankles or bruises while running either toward or away from the burning wreckage. The silver delta-winged aircraft was completing a maneuver known as a `` vertical <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON>,'' the finale of a 20-minute aerial display of 22 of the air force's supersonic fighters, transport and training aircraft. An inquiry was ordered to determine what caused the crash, the first major accident at an Indian military airshow. The pilot was identified as <PERSON> Ramesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON>, the 39-year-old commander of the Mirage squadron. Air Force Chief Marshal S.K. <PERSON> Mehra </PERSON> told reporters the accident apparently was due to `` an error in judgment.'' <PERSON> Mehra </PERSON> said the sky was very hazy and <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> may have miscalculated the jet's altitude. When the pilot started to pull up, <PERSON> Mehra </PERSON> said, the plane was about 18 feet from the ground. If the jet had been 12 feet higher, <PERSON> Bakshi </PERSON> probably could have made it, he said. `` He was one of our most experienced pilots,'' <PERSON> Mehra </PERSON> said. The Mirage was completing the final flyby of Indian Air Force Day, marking the 57th anniversary of the Indian air force and honoring its 115,000 enlisted men. The ceremony was held at the military section of <LOCATION> Palam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, and all civilian flights were halted during the show. The aircraft slammed into the ground, exploded and bounced three times through fuel tanks on the ground, igniting a giant fireball. Two buses caught fire and several trucks and other vehicles in the area were badly damaged by burning chunks of debris. The Mirage is capable of flying up to 1,460 mph at an altitude of 65,600 feet. The first Mirages came off the assembly line in 1966. The Indian air force acquired 49 Mirage 2000 fighters between 1982 and 1986. The jets are considered an essential part of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s fleet, which includes other French-designed aircraft and some of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most sophisticated planes, helicopters and fighters Military experts from <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries have rated the skills of <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> air force pilots among the world's best. But they gave them low marks for aircraft maintenance. At least 30 accidents, most involving the Soviet-made MiG-27 fighters, have occurred in the past four years.

<HEAD>Concern Over Aging Airliners Bringing New FAA Action</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is preparing orders that will force airlines to regularly strip the interiors of their aging jetliners for corrosion inspections. Rules are also being considered to require all new airliner models to undergo pressurized tests on a sample aircraft that would batter the fuselage with the equivalent of two lifetimes of takeoffs and landings. These and other steps to ensure the safety of airliners that are increasingly used long past their designed lifespans were presented at a three-day industry and government conference last week. More than 300 aviation experts at the second annual International Conference on Aging Aircraft viewed slides of deteriorating jetliners, discussed an array of sophisticated detection equipment and exchanged horror stories, including the supposed discovery of a dead frog in a corrosion-prone jetliner section now referred to as `` the guppy pond.'' With the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet of passenger jets exceeding 12 years old and expected to grow older as the demand pushes airlines to refurbish rather than retire their oldest models, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials disclosed plans for new `` airworthiness directives'' to deal with corrosion in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, 737, 727 and 707 jetliners. The orders are expected next month, to be followed in February 1990 by similar directives affecting <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas-built </ORGANIZATION> jets and later for other aircraft, said <PERSON> LeRoy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Certification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directorate </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> `` There are no plans for mandatory retirement ages, but the cost will be going up in maintaining aging aircraft,'' <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> said. The corrosion orders are based on the work of an industry-government task force that already has triggered sweeping changes in the way older airliners are kept safe. Both industry and government officials stress that none of the steps indicate that airliners now in service are unsafe but are an effort to ensure against failures before dangers arise. Since the task force was set up at the first aging airliner conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the industry-backed <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> 16 months ago, the government has ordered mandatory replacements of parts on jetliners as they reach a set number of takeoffs and landings. Previously, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> ordered repetitive inspections, with replacements required only when problems were found. Those orders focused primarily on problems related to metal fatigue as an airliner is pressurized for flight and depressurized upon landing. The new directives, which are expected to be adopted in other countries where U.S.-built airliners fly, will require carriers to set up their own anti-corrosion programs, with inspections on various sections of each airliner at intervals ranging from three to eight years. Corrosion is more closely related than fatigue to chronological age, the quality of care the airliner is given, the environment in which it is flown, and conditions within the aircraft. Frequent coffee spills in the galley or regular hauling of fish or animal products in the cargo hold, for example, can accelerate corrosion. No airliner model is immune to deterioration, said government scientist <PERSON> Pin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>. `` Multiple-site damage is not isolated to one manufacturer or one model but may appear anywhere in the aging fleet,'' he said. Both <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> have conducted extensive tests on selected models to determine how many takeoffs and landings an airliner can undergo without damage. A DC-9 fuselage went through the equivalent of more than 200,000 flights with `` no evidence of multiple-site fatigue damage,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagemaier </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> engineer. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said rules requiring such testing for all new aircraft models are being drawn up and could affect future design. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has been calling for such tests to set design service life for airliners. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> proposes that any extension of the service life be certified only after a tear-down inspection of a representative aircraft. J. <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marceau </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> corrosion expert, said more than 75 percent of corrosion problems been solved in new passenger planes rolling off the assembly line. `` We have the majority of problems licked with new design philosophies,'' he said. The new corrosion orders will classify damage at three levels, including the earliest signs, localized damage and extensive deterioration. `` An airline will have to open its planes up, inspect, repair anything that's found, report the findings to the government, apply corrosive-prevention compounds and then close it up,'' said <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> aging aircraft program manager at the certification office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. `` The goal is to require inspections frequently enough that eventually we wo n't find anything but level-one corrosion,'' he said. The orders could prove costly to some carriers, but <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said most major airlines already have anti-corrosion programs and the required inspections could be done along with other mandatory work. The goal is to find an inexpensive means of quickly checking whole airliners for both cracks and corrosion without tearing them apart. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> scientists indicated significant research still is needed, with a number of methods being tested and used in current inspections. But <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said the only acceptable detection device for the mandatory corrosion inspections is likely to be the human eye.

<HEAD>Refugees Raise Question of German Reunification</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dramatic rush of refugees from East to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is causing officials to take a new look at a prospect once considered remote _ the reunification of that divided country. While experts say the formation of one <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is still not in the cards for the near future, it is a possibility that can no longer be dismissed as very remote. Any concrete moves toward reunification are likely to worry people in countries that have twice in this century faced Germans on the battlefield. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> G.H </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> affairs, reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for eventual unification in testimony before a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee last week, but added that it must be approached with caution because of `` a history in which the unification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> led to instability and war.'' `` The reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> raises the prospect of major changes on the continent, and therefore is something we have to look at very carefully,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Affairs subcommittee on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> `` We have kind of paid lip service to it without really thinking about the implications of it,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I think a lot of countries have done that.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments have long been on record in favor of reuniting <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which was split into two countries after the Allied victory in World War II and the onset of the Cold War between East and West. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said in an interview, `` A lot of people in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, most West European countries, have strong emotional reservations'' about reunification. `` They have n't had to deal with those reservations until very recently.'' Like others interviewed, this official said, `` My own expectation is that reunification is still a good many years away.'' But he added, `` If we had been talking a couple of months ago, I would have said it was very, very remote. The fact that things are moving in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has obviously changed the picture.'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is going to come about in 1990, but it is clearly going to be put on the agenda now and discussed much more.'' So far this year, more than 120,000 East Germans have reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where they are granted automatic citizenship. The exodus has been helped by the decision of the reformist regime in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to open its borders. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> has spoken recently of the possibility of a German confederation, a step short of complete unity. <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahmer </PERSON>, deputy mayor of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, asked about reunification on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' Thursday, said, `` We do n't see reunification in that we would form one state again, but I think that we must come closer ... I think that we will come together on the way to -LRB- a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' But East German historian <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Prokop </PERSON>, asked on the same program whether unification was in prospect, replied, `` Absolutely not. It's a dream of the ... reactionary forces in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' Faced with reform movements in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the Soviets are anxious to keep <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in their orbit. The country has a standard of living that is the envy of many of its East Bloc neighbors, although it remains far below <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s. Experts said one of the major obstacles to unification is the absence in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of a strong opposition such as the Solidarity union which has formed the new government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or the movements that are bringing about broad political reforms in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` I think we are far from a place where this East German regime or its likely successors are going to move in that direction,'' said <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnenfeldt </PERSON>, Berlin-born guest scholar in foreign policy studies at the liberal-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> counselor. `` <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, in this situation, I do n't think has very many good choices,'' said <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. `` There seems to be no way out,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, director of foreign policy and defense studies for the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Still, said <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, `` We see the possibility for the first time of revisiting the German question in a real kind of way. I would have said a year ago, ` Not in my lifetime.' I am beginning to think, given how swift the events were in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and what has happened with the refugees, that it could happen a lot sooner than a lot of people think.'' <PERSON> Sonnenfeldt </PERSON> said the recent developments `` certainly have put that subject on people's agenda again.'' `` If one means re-establishing the previous German <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>, even in a somewhat smaller territory, I think that is probably not in the cards for any time soon,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said. `` I think there is a lot of concern in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> about the reconstitution of something that resembles the previous <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that existed from 1871 on and especially in the Hitlerian period,'' he said. `` I think in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this is less of a factor, but I am sure there are particular groups in this country who would have strong feelings about it.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, `` It raises maybe concern, but concern only in the sense that we are not sure where it might end up. And it could end up in a number of different ways, some of which could not be in our interest.''

<TEXT>
 A newspaper advertisement offering interest-free home improvement loans for Hurricane Hugo victims targeted residents of the wrong <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The Sears ad ran last week in the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> and The <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. The storm caused some flooding and power outages in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, but the real damage was in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` Due to the recent damage caused by Hurricane Hugo, we will now offer 0 percent financing,'' the ad began. It went on to tell customers they did n't need to wait for insurance checks to begin repairing their homes and that the loans did n't need to be repaid for three months. The ad listed a telephone number for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> `` I think it's pretty obvious in this case it's the wrong <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Emerson </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an advertising salesman for the West Virginia-based <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> newspapers. He said the paper was partly to blame for not spotting the error on the page, `` but then again, they send a camera-ready -LRB- ready-to-print -RRB- ad, an insertion order, and we just schedule it,'' he said. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> of the Sears store in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mall </ORGANIZATION> said the ad was probably placed by someone in the <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> district, while the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> stores are part of the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> district. `` We do n't know at this point how it got in the paper here,'' she said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> officials said they did not know whether local stores would honor the ad. <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> store manager <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said he could not comment without speaking to someone in the main office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<BYLINE>Christopher Columbus Did What? ^By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Columbus Day poll suggests one-fourth of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> college seniors either never heard or do not remember the childhood ditty: `` In 1492, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> sailed the ocean blue.'' In addition to finding that one in four do not know <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> made his famous landing in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> prior to the year 1500, the Gallup Poll suggests considerable ignorance of other basic facts about history and literature. Nearly 60 percent did not know the Korean War started when <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was president, 58 percent did not know that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> wrote `` The Tempest'' and nearly a quarter believed a famous saying from <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> is part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution. `` If the students' answers were to be graded, more than half of those tested would have failed,'' concluded the survey, which was conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>. Armed with the survey results, <ORGANIZATION> NEH </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> called Sunday for colleges and universities to revise their curricula so undergraduates study `` essential areas of knowledge.'' In a booklet titled `` 50 Hours,'' she outlined a suggested core curriculum for college students. Responding to her admonition, several college presidents essentially told the <ORGANIZATION> NEH </ORGANIZATION> chief _ in more or less polite terms _ either to mind her own business or that she was behind the times. Here are some of the Gallup Poll highlights: _ 24 percent of the college seniors surveyed thought <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> landed in the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> some time after 1500 _ 42 percent could not place the Civil War in the correct half century _ 58 percent did not know that <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> was the author of `` The Tempest,'' but 95 percent knew that <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Twain </PERSON> wrote `` The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. _ 58 percent did not know <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was president when the Korean War began Fourteen percent thought it started when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was president. _ 55 percent could not identify the `` Magna Carta. _ 23 percent believed that <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>' phrase, `` From each according to his ability, to each according to his need,'' is part of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Constitution According to the survey, 39 percent of the college seniors failed the 49-question history section. On the portion of the survey devoted to literature, which consisted of 38 questions, 68 percent of the students failed. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said many colleges and universities allow students to earn bachelor's degrees without taking courses in history, literature, science or mathematics and urged trustees and administrators to support faculty members who are working to strengthen general education requirements. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s core curriculum suggests study in five basic areas of knowledge. The first area, 18 semester hours on cultures and civilizations, would start with a one-sememster survey course on the origins of civilization in general to be followed by two semesters of Western Civilization and one of American Civilization and then two, one-semester courses to be chosen from among the following: African Civilization, East Asian Civilization, <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civilization </ORGANIZATION>, Latin American Civilization and South Asian Civilization. The other four areas of basic study: foreign language, 12 hours; concepts of mathematics, six hours; natural sciences, eight hours; social sciences, six hours. The courses, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said, should be taught in small classes and in an integrated fashion, so that, for example, students reading <PERSON> Descartes </PERSON>' philosophy in a Western Civilization course are reminded of his contributions to mathematics. She also suggested that the classes be taught by the college's most distinguished faculty. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>, dean of faculty at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, criticized the <ORGANIZATION> NEH </ORGANIZATION> for recommending a `` superficial, rigid, and impractical'' college curriculum. He added that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> this fall began a general education curriculum with an emphasis on history and literature. `` A reform that relies so heavily on the traditional western civilization course runs the risk of a dangerous superficiality,'' said <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>. `` The Western Civilization course tries to ` do everything' and demands for its success the mythical ` Renaissance man' as teacher. History should be taught by broadly educated historians and literature by professors of literature.'' <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> said, `` It is encouraging to notice how much the report mirrors the curricula revisions that have taken place'' at his school. Similar sentiments were echoed by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBieggio </PERSON>, who said the school already has gotten an revised curriculum approved by the community and board of trustees. <ORGANIZATION> Elton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruins </ORGANIZATION> of <ORGANIZATION> Hope </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said, `` Hope never gave way to current fads of dropping core curriculum. We've always believed it is very important For many years we were probably considered old-fashioned by a lot of schools.'' The Gallup survey included 33 questions taken from a 1986 NEH-funded survey of 17-year-olds and five questions from examinations that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> administers to prospective <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizens. Grading the 87-question survey on the standard `` A'' to `` F'' scale, where scoring less than 60 percent correct constitutes a falling grade, 55 percent of the students would have earned an `` F.'' An additional 20 percent would have received a `` D.'' Only 11 percent of the respondents would have earned an `` A'' or `` B.'' The Gallup survey of 696 seniors was conducted between April 4 and April 27, using a self-administered test booklet. It had a 4 percent margin of error. The participating students attend 67 four-year American colleges and universities, both public and private.

 Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> criticized the government's schooling of Native Americans on Sunday and called for a study that he said `` could prove revolutionary for Indian education.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> used the 21st <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, to call for a `` federally directed gathering campaign'' and a special task force `` involving the participation of Native American citizens and educators'' to analyze the problems that Native Americans face with education. A copy of his speech was released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said the results of the survey he called for could have the same impact as the a 1983 government general education report that `` shocked the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public and led to the education reform movement that has come to many areas of the country.'' `` I see this developing into an ` Indian Nations At Risk' study, which will follow the path laid out by the landmark study of the national education structure, ` A Nation At Risk,''' said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. The education secretary said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> has agreed `` that we must move in this direction and the two departments, Education and Interior, must work together to address the needs in Indian education.'' <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> are the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's only Hispanic Cabinet members. The education secretary, a Texan like President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was first appointed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as the first Hispanic to the Cabinet. Briefly recounting the history of Native Americans, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said, `` Long before the appearance of the Anglo on the shores of the North American continent, you nations had instituted systems of education. `` The first treaty signed with the newly independent <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1794 by the <LOCATION> Oneida </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tuscarora </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION> tribes provided for Indian education,'' he said. `` The respect for knowledge held by Native Americans makes the failures of effective education policies for the Indian nations these past two centuries all the more tragic,'' said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, noting an article that described `` the history of Indian education -LRB- as one -RRB- of crossed purposes and unfulfilled hopes that is still unfolding today.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study of high school sophomores found that from 1980 through 1986, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alaskan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natives </ORGANIZATION> dropped out at more than double the rate for the whole test group. Native American students are likely to be labeled handicapped or learning disabled, the study said. Eleven percent of Indian sophomores in public and private schools were enrolled in special education programs and 36 percent were classified as having some form of handicap. In comparison, 9 percent blacks and 7 percent of Hispanics were in special programs. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said the 1980 census found only about 8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> 25 years and older had completed four years of college. He said a recent study revealed that nearly three out of four American Indian college students do not earn degrees. The statistics are due partly to the government's failed attempts to at first assimilate Native Americans and then to urbanize them, he said. Now, <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> said, the federal government is trying to replace assimilation with self-determination. He said these efforts are being bolstered by the administration's education initiatives like choice _ allowing parents to decide where to send their children to school _ and school-based management, where principals, teachers, parents and students set their own curricula, agendas and plans. He said the study he wants must provide a complete review of government programs that affect Indian education. The focus will be on the cost effectiveness of current efforts, as well as developing cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and the Education Department.

<HEAD>Democratic Senators Vow to Protect Child-Care Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders seeking to expedite passage of a giant deficit-reduction bill expressed concern Sunday that a proposed expansion of child-care benefits might be lost in the process. `` Child-care legislation is of the highest priority in this <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ a far higher priority than a capital-gains tax cut,'' which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told reporters. `` We do n't want that to fall between the cracks.'' The child-care issue apparently was the main one raised in a private meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders of both parties. As recently as Saturday, the biggest questions facing similar meetings were how Republicans could win the capital-gains tax cut that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants and how Democrats could defeat capital gains and substitute expanded Individual Retirement Accounts. Whatever the issues, the only agreement was that meetings would resume Tuesday in an effort to see if hundreds of provisions unrelated to deficit reduction can be stripped from a bill whose main purpose is deficit reduction. Finishing the big deficit bill is the major business facing both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> during the upcoming holiday-shortened week. However, the House may get to Senate-passed flag legislation by the end of the week. Unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> completes action by Oct. 16 on the deficit bill, the Gramm-Rudman law will trigger automatic across-the-board cuts in most spending programs. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> already has passed its deficit bill _ a package loaded down with such extraneous issues as repealing catastrophic health coverage for retirees; restoring the Fairness Doctrine that requires broadcasters to air all sides of an issue; extension of several expiring tax breaks for a variety of interests, and a broad new initiative to help lower-income working parents. The House bill also includes a capital-gains tax cut. The cut can not be considered totally extraneous because it would increase tax collections and reduce the deficit in the next three years but lose money for at least two years after that. A similarly bloated bill is awaiting action in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. It contains a different child-care plan but no capital-gains tax cut. Instead, Democrats added to the package an expansion of tax-deductible IRAs for all workers. Leaders of both parties have decried the tendency to load up the deficit-reduction bills with unrelated amendments. Now, to avoid disruptions that the Oct. 16 automatic spending cuts might bring, they are looking for a way to strip away the amendments and leave a relatively `` clean'' deficit-reduction package. If the effort is successful, it likely will require that a new bill be originated in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to include the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> expansion, the child-care initiative, dozens of other tax provisions and _ if the Republicans have their way _ a capital-gains cut. `` We do n't have an agreement yet but everybody in there today thought we should get one,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> told reporters. There was no explanation of why so much attention was given the child-care issue in Sunday's meeting. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said only that in a caucus Saturday, several Democrats insisted that the child-care initiative not be lost in efforts to trim the deficit-reduction bill. Child care is a popular issue with both parties this year, although there are differences on the form in which aid should be channeled to low-income working parents. The bill written by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> involves only three tax credits, with no increase in federal grants to states. The tax-credit approach traditionally is the one favored by Republicans. However, it is no secret that some liberal Democrats are uncomfortable that most of the debate on deficit reduction has been focused on the capital-gains cut, which would benefit chiefly those making more than $ 100,000 a year, and on expanded IRAs, which are aimed mostly at those between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000. Talking about child care allows Democrats to shift the focus to families in the $ 25,000-a-year range. Involved in the discussions Sunday in addition to <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> were <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and senior Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Tenn </LOCATION>., and senior Republican <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who heads the

 Nearly six months after the brutal rape of a Central Park jogger, the 29-year-old woman is recovering and sending messages to a group of fellow runners who are helping make the park safer for everyone who uses its green expanse. Police have beefed up park security and volunteers are patrolling the park, offering partners for runners and bringing groups of them together for safer exercise. `` This is how good comes from bad,'' said <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Road Runners Safety Program. The jogger, an investment banker, was attacked by a mob of teen-agers as she ran alone in the northern part of the park, late in the evening of April 19. When police found the woman hours later, she was in a coma and had lost three-quarters of her blood. Paramedics did not expect her to live. She remained in critical condition until May 1, when she appeared to raise her eyebrows as her name was called and raised her hand. She was walking a bit when she was moved June 7 to <LOCATION> Gaylord </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. By midsummer, she reportedly was classified as a 7 on a recovery scale of 1 to 8 Patients must reach level 8 to live independently. She was able to read novels, relearn basic math skills and call colleagues at <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brothers </LOCATION>, where she had worked before the attack. <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Brass </PERSON> said last week that the jogger was `` making good progress, doing well.'' She would not elaborate. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Runners </ORGANIZATION>, said he had never met the injured jogger but received communications from her through a mutual friend. `` I get little messages from her that she jogs a little bit at <LOCATION> Gaylord </LOCATION> and that she hopes someday to run the marathon,'' said <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>. `` She's inspirational to anyone _ not just runners,'' said <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>. `` She came through a horrendous experience and evidently she's recovering.'' Six youths have been indicted in the attack; hearings are scheduled for Tuesday although no trial date has been set. The case focused the energy of the city's legions of joggers who were unwilling to surrender the huge park, which stretches 2 -LCB- miles long and a half-mile wide through the center of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Runners </ORGANIZATION> launched its safety program, in which 200 men and women take turns walking or running along a course in the park in shifts from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. The joggers carry lightweight radios and wear bright orange vests. `` They are the eyes and ears of the Central Park community,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` The police ca n't be everywhere; citizens have to take responsibility.'' The volunteers have used the radios to report bicycle accidents, stone-throwing incidents, a car accident and a sexual assault; last month, a man who allegedly fondled two female joggers was arrested 15 minutes after they flagged down a Road Runner volunteer for help. `` There is a very positive feeling among people in Central Park toward the people in the orange vests. ... It really boosts the community morale in Central Park,'' Ms. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was preparing covert action to seize <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> during a coup attempt last week but the uprising collapsed before the plan could be executed, top officials said Sunday. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the decision near the end of a failed coup last Tuesday, and the order was conveyed to the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>, said Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the White House national security adviser. `` The message that was sent was that if there were an opportunity to do this, without risking bloodshed and significant loss of American life, and to do so without open military involvement, then he was free to go ahead, the commander on the ground was free to go ahead,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Meet the Press.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that at the outset of the coup, he told <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON> to be prepared to use peaceful means to take custody of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but the chance never came. `` After the Panamanians had contacted us and told us ... that they had <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> but that they would not give him to us, I made it clear that our commander on the scene was authorized to get him if he could, without using military force, and that he should develop an option or a plan to use military force to get him,' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said on the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` Face the Nation.'' `` We never made the decision to use military force, that would have involved going in against the rebels and taking <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from them. I never thought that was a very good idea, but we told to him to be prepared in case he got the order to do so. Shortly after that, the coup fell apart,'' said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. The order to ready non-uniformed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces for a covert action to grab <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was first reported in Sunday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Although that report did not attribute the decision to the president, <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> said, `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally was responsible what ever guidance was sent down, yes, personally ordered whatever guidance was sent to General <PERSON> Thurman </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said top presidential advisers believe they acted correctly during the failed coup, despite criticism from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces should have helped the rebels or to intervened to seize <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges. `` There is nothing like 20-20 hindsight. Given what we know now about what was actually happening on the ground, then, I think I would not change what we did,'' Scowcroft said on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program, `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' Nearly a week after the incident, it was still not 100 percent certain that the rebels who seized <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters ever had custody of the strongman, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said, and they told the deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commander in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, that they would not hand him over. `` The rebels never asked us, indeed when we had that one meeting with General <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, we asked them to give him, and they said, ` No,''' said Scowcroft. `` At that point, we became fairly certain, although we did not know for sure and still have no positive proof <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was there. We had pretty good assurance that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was in fact there,'' and the decision was made to use non-uniformed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to grab him, said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. The indication later Tuesday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was at his headquarters about 600 yards from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> command center `` changed the calculus of what we were prepared to do,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has told reporters that he was never in custody and `` the last thing he has said was that, no, he was never there,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. Throughout the coup, said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the administration was in `` the fog of war. ... You are operating without a full deck of intelligence information.'' Changes will be made to avoid a repeat, he said, but did not spell out what steps were planned. `` We're not happy,'' <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said. `` We certainly hope <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will not remain in power. ... He is a dangerous symbol. `` Our procedures, and in some cases some organizational things, ought to be improved as a result of it, and we will be doing that,'' he said. Although the rebels said they did not want open <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help, they did ask American forces to block two of three overland routes to the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s headquarters. `` The plotters came in and said, ` we do not want American help. We do not want our action tainted by being involved with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. All we want you to do is just sort of keep the reinforcements from these two roads,''' Scowcroft said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces deployed to block the two roads designated by the plotters, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decided that further use of uniformed <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops to aid the rebels was too dangerous, <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> said. `` The two roads that we blocked, the causeway and the bridge over the canal, are ... bottlenecks. They are easy to isolate. They are areas within our exercise area. ... Clearly, they are they are things that can be done within our general treaty authorities,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, referring to the 1977 pact turing over the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> to the Panamanians. `` The third route is very different. ... It is down through the heart of old <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, multiple routes, crowded city, to do that, and outside the area where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops move and exercise, that have been the overt exercise of military force, perhaps into a fire fight, to block them in the heart of a heavily populated area,'' Scowcroft said.

 The son of the late singer <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Darin </PERSON> is suing <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 10 million, alleging the restaurant chain copied his father's singing style in the `` Mac Tonight'' commercials.

The commercials feature a tuxedoed man with a smiling quarter-moon head, seated at a piano and belting out the hamburger jingle. The suit alleges the character's voice and gestures resemble those of <PERSON> Darin </PERSON>, who died in 1973 at age 37 of heart problems. The suit was filed on behalf of <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> <PERSON> Darin </PERSON> _ the singer's son and only heir _ and the <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Darin </PERSON> <PERSON> Testamentary </PERSON> <PERSON> Trust </PERSON>. <PERSON> Darin </PERSON>'s upbeat version of `` Mack the Knife,'' a song from the 1928 German musical `` The Threepenny Opera,'' sold 2 million copies and won <PERSON> Darin </PERSON> two 1960 Grammy awards. The suit seeks an injunction halting the McDonald's commercials, $ 100,000 in general damages and $ 10 million in punitive damages. Also named as a defendant is the advertising agency of <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> and Colombatto in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> canceled the remaining six weeks of its never-opened fall season Sunday after striking orchestra members overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer, the company's lawyer said. Members of Local 802 of the Associated Musicians of Greater <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voted 56-4 against the four-year proposal, the union announced Sunday. They have been on strike since Sept. 13 _ what would have been the season's opening night. In addition to the orchestra members, 300 to 400 performers and backstage personnel are idled by the strike, said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppenheimer </PERSON>, the opera's attorney and lead negotiator. `` The human loss is obviously significant and very regrettable,'' Oppenheimer said. Equally important, he added, is `` the cultural loss to this community.'' The contract voted down Saturday would have guaranteed the musicians 29 weeks of work per year, the same number of weeks as the previous contract, and raised wages and benefits 6 -LCB- percent each year, <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> said. The opera initially sought to cut the minimum work year to 23 weeks. Union spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> said members believed the deal did n't go far enough in improving wages and benefits. Under the old contract, orchestra members made $ 755 per 19 \ - No new talks were scheduled but both sides said they probably would meet soon, in hopes of saving the opera's spring season. The opera company was established in 1943.

 Nearly four centuries after explorer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> sailed up the river that bears his name, a replica of his ship, the Half <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, will journey down the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on its maiden journey. The new Half Moon, with a crew of 20, will set out downriver on its shakedown cruise this coming Saturday, making an overnight stop in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, who conceived the project, announced Saturday. The crew will then sail it down the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on a two-week cruise to the ship's new home at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on the western side of Pamlico Sound, <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> said. Plans for future voyages are undecided, he said. The Half <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> was built to honor the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>' contributions to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s 1609 voyage up the river, when the English explorer was working for the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The 85-foot, 120-ton replica is a little different from <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>'s `` Halve Maen. This Half Moon features such non-authentic features as an emergency engine and contemporary navigational equipment. `` You play a fine line with the historical thing,'' said <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, citing constraints such as <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> regulations, `` but it's as historically accurate as it can be.'' The ship originally was set to embark on a tour of several Northeastern ports on July 5. But the June death of the ship's architect and chief builder, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who fell from the mast of another ship, forced a change of plans `` We had blueprints ... but it did n't say what some of the sizes of the parts were, or the colors,'' <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> also had to hire people to do work that <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> would have done for free, boosting the cost from $ 1 million to about $ 1.2 million, he said. <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> said he hopes to pay for the Half Moon by charging admission at a planned visitor center in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a cheering audience of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> women Sunday that he has appointed more women to senior positions in his first nine months than any president before did in a full year. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> interrupted a three-day holiday weekend at Camp David to fly here by helicopter for a self-congratulatory address before 2,200 of the party faithful at the biennial convention of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Women. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boasted that the Republican party `` understands the heartbeat of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people'' and is `` the only party that delivers on its promises.'' He made no reference to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and last Tuesday's abortive coup there. Critics have accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of failing to act decisively to aid rebel officers seeking to overthrow strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his right hand bandaged from minor surgery three days ago, instead crowed about successes on several fronts, from arms control with the Soviets to curbing pollution and rebuilding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools He praised the 140,000-member federation for mounting a candidate recruiting program called Project'90. `` Part of governing is making sure that in the Executive Branch the best are chosen to serve. So we've sought out the best _ and our record of appointing talented and qualified women to important offices proves it,'' the president told the women at a luncheon in the Baltimore Convention Center. `` We've appointed 139 women to senior positions in this administration. ...'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` That's more women appointed in our first nine months than any previous administration managed in any given year.'' `` I frankly believe that's a great step toward good government,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said the 139 included: _ 88 women nominated or announced for senior positions requiring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation; _ 21 to presidential appointments not requiring confirmation; _ 30 to deputy assistant secretary posts in Cabinet departments, also not White House personnel director <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said last month that 20 percent of the posts requiring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation have gone to women. The old record for appointing women to posts requiring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation was 72, set by President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> women were winding up their 25th biennial convention. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who also addressed their last convention in 1987, said, `` We promised <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> peace and prosperity and we're keeping that promise.'' He cited his recent call at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for a ban on all chemical weapons, as well as his proposal to drastically reduce conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and what he called `` steady movement'' toward long-range nuclear arms treaty with the Soviets. The economy has just entered `` the 83rd month of uninterrupted economic growth,'' and nearly half a million black Americans have found jobs in the past two years, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his administration has also made headway on the environment, in staging the recent education summit and in the struggle against drugs. The crowd gave some of its biggest cheers to First Lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whom the presidential affectionately introduced as `` the silver fox.'' The couple flew immediately back to Camp David from <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> after the 15-minute speech. The Bushes were spending the Columbus Day holiday at the presidential retreat before returning to the White House Monday afternoon. On Thursday <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be out on the hustings in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, trying to help Republicans retain the congressional seat of the late Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, R-Miss., and wrest the mayoralty of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from the Democrats

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is waging a full-blown damage control operation over the botched Panamanian uprising, struggling against a torrent of criticism, confusion and shifting explanations by the White House about the events and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response. The failed coup against Panamanian strongman Ge. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was regarded within the White House as the first crisis test for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and officials at the highest level were distressed by mistakes in intelligence gathering, coordination and other problems. `` We're not happy. Our procedures, and in some cases some organizational things, ought to be improved as a result of it, and we will be doing that,'' White House national security adviser Brent Scowcroft said Sunday on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> program `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said that `` given everything that was available to us then, and given what I know now, I still think we made the right decision.'' Paraphrasing the president, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said that `` with 20-20 hindsight, I ca n't think of anything I would do differently than what I did.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was adamant in defending his decision not to intervene militarily to unseat <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I'm not just being stubborn but as I look at all the information I would n't have made a different decision then,'' he said last week. Aside from being a learning experience, the episode was a dramatic reminder of the limits on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> influence in other countries. It was a painful experience for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had encouraged the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> to rise up against their leader but then decided to stay on the sidelines, refusing to authorize action by any of the 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not hide his frustration that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was still in power. `` Disappointed that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s still there? Yes I am,'' he said. Republicans joined Democrats in flaying the administration. In one of the toughest criticisms, Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, called the administration's handling of the coup as `` an incredible stain on us'' and called White House statements a `` weak-kneed explanation for failure.'' The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., criticized the administration Sunday for not planning in advance what aid it would give Panamanian military officers who might attempt a coup `` Every time there has been a witness before our committee, we have asked again and again and again, if we start to take action, are we prepared to see it through?'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> became president, every single word of authority that he had requested from the intelligence committee and every single penny that he has requested from the intelligence committee relating to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, he has gotten and gotten with my support,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. Scowcroft immediately challenged <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>'s contention, but declined to give specifics, saying the details were secret. `` Senator <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> over the last year, his contribution to such things, leaves me kind of astonished that he would say that,'' said <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. `` We did not get everything we had wanted.'' Much of the congressional criticism of the president's handling of the crisis stemmed from the shifting administration version of events. Did rebel forces ever offer to turn over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>? <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and Scowcroft on Sunday all repeated administration assertions that the rebels refused to hand over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and even questioned whether they ever had him in custody. But late last week administration officials acknowledged that a cable was sent to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> saying that the rebels wanted to give him up. The word ` want' should have read ` wo n't,' officials insisted. Did the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> take part in the coup attempt? The White House at first insisted there was no involvement, then acknowledged that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops were deployed along key access routes, at the rebels' request, to block forces loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from reaching his headquarters. `` They would have been stopped,'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, when asked if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces would have intercepted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> reinforcements. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also recanted his original claim that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had not been in touch with coup leaders before the uprising. In fact, he said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had advance discussions with coup leader Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials originally said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been reluctant to take direct action in the coup because of doubts about <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON>, who was known as a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> confidant and had helped put down an earlier coup. On Sunday, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> repeated that he at first feared the coup was `` setup.'' <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> was killed in the coup, perhaps by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> himself. In retrospect, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We think it -LRB- the coup -RRB- was legitimate now.'' Confusion is endemic to such situations, he said. `` It's because that's the nature of coups,'' he insisted. `` There is conflicting information. This whole thing happened in a six-hour period and -LRB- there are -RRB- people running all over ... It's the ambiguity of the coup itself, as is true of all coups, that caused the conflict of information.

 In 1953, Soviet tanks and troops brutally put down an East German workers' uprising. But in 1989, pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> chant `` <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gorby </LOCATION>, help us!'' Many of the nation's 16.6 million people view reform-minded Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who visited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> over the weekend to mark the nation's 40th anniversary, as a sign of hope for democratic change. But the communist leadership in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> will hear nothing of it, despite the growing exodus of East Germans who have fled to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> in the past month seeking more freedom and economic opportunity. The official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> called the weekend protesters troublemakers who had been chanting `` slogans against the republic'' _ referring at least in part to the cries of `` Gorby!'' East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> Saturday dismissed the protesters' demands and said their hopes were `` built on sand.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told the 77-year-old <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> of a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> saying that `` he who is late is punished'' and urged the East German leader to consider reform. By the end of the day Saturday, more than 15,000 people had taken to the streets in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and five other cities in the biggest protests in 36 years. In 1953, it was the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> that crushed demonstrations and killed at least 267 protesters. More than 100 others were later executed for their role in the uprising. Angered by economic hardship and increased productivity quotas, workers in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> walked off the job on June 16, 1953. The following day, more than 12,000 protesters took to the streets in the city, and demonstrators also marched in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and other major cities. Soviet military commanders stationed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> declared a state of emergency and sent in troops to quell the protests with tanks and guns. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> at the time was still under direct Soviet domination, even though the state was formed in 1949. Communist authorities called the uprising `` a coup attempt supported by Western agents.'' Until recently, mass protests had been a rarity in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. This weekend, the protesters were emboldened by a Soviet leader _ rather than wary of possible <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> intervention. And although an estimated 380,000 Soviet troops remain stationed on East German soil, this time it was East German police who put down the demonstrations. Witnesses and media reports said police chased, kicked and punched demonstrators. They also said hundreds of protesters were arrested and injured. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit was friendly and cordial, there were other signs of change between the two countries. When Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for the 30th anniversary celebrations in 1979, his picture was on the front page of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION>. Ten years later, there was no <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> picture, and there was no customary live television coverage of his arrival.

 A leading Lebanese Moslem legislator said Sunday that talks on ending his country's civil war were deadlocked and that a `` more vicious war'' could break out unless Christians surrender some political power. <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who represents the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an alliance of 18 Syrian and Iranian-backed Lebanese factions, told reporters that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> will not withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> until the Christians agree to political reforms. `` We're at a dangerous crossroads,'' he said after 63 Lebanese lawmakers failed to meet for the third straight day because of deep divisions on the central issue of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military presence in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and reforms proposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The 33 Christian and 30 Moslem legislators have been in the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> resort of Taif since Sept. 30 to discuss proposals to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The 22-member Arab League is sponsoring the meeting. <PERSON> Khatib </PERSON> said the meeting was a `` historic and golden opportunity'' that should not be lost. `` The alternative is a renewal of the war, and this time it will be a more vicious war because the weapons are going to be more vicious,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> has proposed that Syrian troops withdraw over two years from Moslem sectors of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in the east. A new Lebanese government then would negotiate future Syrian military deployments. Lebanese Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, has demanded a complete Syrian pullout within six months. The Syrians, who consider <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> vital to their security against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, have made it clear they will not withdraw before the Christians agree to share power equally with Moslems. They have also linked withdrawal of their 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from a border strip in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The Israelis have refused to budge despite <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> pressure. <PERSON> Youssef </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>, a Lebanese <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member, said consultations in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> were deadlocked for the past three days by what he called a `` tug of war'' between Moslems and Christians. The Christians, dominated by the Maronites, have held most key posts in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s government, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, judiciary and army since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. They were considered the majority then. But Moslems now make up an estimated 55 percent of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> country's 4 million population. The Syrians moved in under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate in 1976, the year after the civil war broke out. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> claims they abrogated that mandate by openly siding with the Moslems. The Syrians insist they have never been asked to leave. But the Christians claim the Syrians ignored two formal requests by former presidents <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarkis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, although outgunned and outnumbered, launched a `` war of liberation'' against the Syrians in March. That touched off six months of fierce artillery battles that killed more than 900 people before an Arab League-brokered cease-fire took hold Sept. 22. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s political problems are further complicated by the two rival governments that have ruled since September 1988; one is led by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and the other by acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem. King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> has been in contact with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> in an effort to break the deadlock. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has made no public comment. But <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> was quoted by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Al-Seyassah </ORGANIZATION> daily Sunday as saying that his side considers the cease-fire as a `` permanent peace'' rather than just a truce Fahd, <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> form the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> mediation committee that is trying to end <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war, which has killed more than 150,000 people. A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> circulated to reporters in Taif Sunday backed the lawmakers' meeting and praised their `` courageous efforts.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Botswana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed this diamond-rich nation since independence in 1966, retained a comfortable majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, according to partial returns Sunday. The party captured all 19 districts where final results were available for the elections, and it appeared set to add to its majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Prior to Saturday's balloting, the party held 28 of the 34 seats. The left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Botswana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> was expected to retain at least four of its five seats. The <ORGANIZATION> Botswana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lost its lone seat. This peaceful, southern African nation is one of only a few on the continent to hold regular, multiparty elections. Saturday's polls were the sixth since <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 23 years ago President <PERSON> Quett </PERSON> <PERSON> Masire </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> retained their comfortable majority on the strength of <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s surging capitalist economy, which has grown at least 10 percent annually throughout the 1980s. Diamonds from the <LOCATION> Kalahari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>, along with cattle ranching, account for most of the wealth in this thinly populated desert nation of 1.2 million. When <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> gained independence it was among the world's 20 poorest nations, with a per capita annual income of less than $ 100.

At a time when many African nations are crippled by huge foreign debts, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s government has spent cautiously and has foreign reserves in excess of $ 2 billion, enough to pay for more than two years of imports. <PERSON> Masire </PERSON>, president since 1980, has avoided expensive public works projects and concentrated on small-scale development. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> argued that <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s wealth has not reached the ordinary workers and called for an increase in public spending and the creation of more social programs.

 A military jet apparently malfunctioned shortly after takeoff from an aircraft carrier, and three crewmen were killed when they ejected before it crashed into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Sunday.

 Azerbaijani railroad crews defied a national ban on transport strikes Sunday and again stemmed the flow of desperately needed supplies to rival <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Reports conflicted, however, on how much food, fuel and building supplies were reaching the Armenian republic. `` Our drivers are striking and demanding guarantees of their safety'' in response to gunfire and stoning attacks on several trains Saturday night in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> activist <PERSON> Shahin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadzhiev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gadzhiev </PERSON> identified himself as a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Other members of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> denied that train traffic had been halted. `` The trains are running, but the attacks on them are also continuing,'' <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the Azerbaijani capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, reported late Sunday that 37 trains had been dispatched from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> over the past day and a half, but it said `` extremist forces are still hindering the normal functioning of the route.'' About 400 trains with a total of 60,000 cars have been reported idled on main lines in the southwestern region of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Soviet legislature imposed a temporary ban on strikes in such key sectors as transport and energy Tuesday after President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> warned that stoppages could ruin the economy and lead to anarchy. It also ordered the ministries of defense and interior to restore rail traffic between the two feuding <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republics. Troops moved in to protect the trains, and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media said Friday the two-month blockade that crippled <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was over. But the measures failed to quell the prolonged ethnic feuding over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the fertile region claimed by both <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Christian Armenian enclave has been part of Moslem-dominated <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> since 1923. Nineteen months of unrest over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> has left 117 dead, thousands injured and more than 2,000 homes and apartments destroyed, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. In the disputed region, five people were wounded in clashes Saturday and an epidemic of viral hepatitis threatened the population, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` Mutual hostility blinds the participants of the conflict with dark malice and suppresses their reason,'' the official news agency said, noting that reports from the region increasingly resemble dispatches from war zones. Airlifts `` are the only thing preventing mass starvation'' in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which has a predominantly Armenian population of about 160,000, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said a highway bridge on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Stepanakert </LOCATION>, was blown up early Saturday, cutting off additional areas Ungathered grape crops are rotting in the field, armed attacks against villages continue and ambulances can not respond to calls because they have no gas, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Armenian activist <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Popoyan </PERSON> said Sunday that <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> was still hit by food and fuel shortages, although they were not as severe as in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. He said the few shipments that made it through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> were sabotaged. They either contained damaged materials or cisterns filled with water instead of fuel. `` Everything that arrived is no good,'' he said in a telephone interview from the Armenian capital of <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. `` That the blockade was stopped at all is a myth.'' <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials and reporters for state-run media in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> were unavailable Sunday for comment on the blockade. About 80 percent of Armenian rail traffic runs through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. The Azerbaijani blockade has virtually halted reconstruction work on Armenian areas destroyed by the massive earthquake last December that left 25,000 dead. <PERSON> Gadzhiev </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> is demanding Azerbaijani control of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, accused Armenians of attempting to impose their own blockades on <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. He said Saturday's bridge explosion in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was aimed at the Azerbaijani village nearby. The power supply to part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> also has been interrupted by <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s unrest, <PERSON> Gadzhiev </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>

<TEXT>
 Spring 1990 will mark the rebirth of flower power, at least in the fashion world. <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, who opened the Italian spring-summer ready-to-wear shows Sunday with his <ORGANIZATION> Emporio </ORGANIZATION> line, called on the young to recall the hippie dress code of their parents _ gypsy skirts and shawls, vests, tattered jeans, oversized shirts and jackets, clumpy sandals. For beach boys and girls, <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> drew inspiration from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> with fishnet and burlap his-and-her sarongs and diaper shorts. Italian beaches have long bade farewell to the bikini of the 1960s, giving way to whole suits for women and surf shorts for men. <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> takes the look a step further by delving into grandma's trunk for those Great Gatsby striped tank suits A gasp went up among Americans attending the early morning show in the theater of <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>'s downtown palazzo at the parade of bare-breasted woman surrounded by bare-chested men, all wearing <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>'s jeans. Europeans, accustomed to topless bathing, did n't bat an eyelash The blazer king likes his jackets long and light, with a curved front like a tulip petal, reminiscent of designs several seasons ago by <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON>. There was a touch of <PERSON> Gigli </PERSON> too in the faded pastel shades of the collection and the rounded uneven hemlines of skirts and dresses. For summer <PERSON> Armani </PERSON> hikes his hemlines way above his demure winter length. Lightweight pantsuits with ample jackets and baggy trousers and a series of cool cotton jumpsuits are sure to attract summer city dwellers. Another fashion favorite of the younger set, <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON>, also showed Sunday morning. What attracts the young in <LOCATION> Moschino </LOCATION> is his irony toward fashion and the fashion world at large. During his shows he likes to hide his own beautiful clothes under exaggerations of other designers' embellishments Thus he once based an entire show on headgear from stovepipes to teddy bears, mocking <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacroix </PERSON>. At every show he makes a point of ladening his evening wear with heavy gold chains, a Chanel trademark. <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON> also likes to poke fun at people who live by labels, often sewing his own label on the outside of an outfit. Last season he designed a jacket with the words `` very expensive jacket'' stitched on the back in gold letters. For spring-summer 1990, <PERSON> Moschino </PERSON> also flirt with the new hippie trend in a series of multicolored gypsy skirts, jeans outfits and Mexican-style long vests, but the bulk of his collection was based on an evening look of basic black and gold. His most astonishing outfit was a three-piece suit _ jacket, brassiere and short skirt _ in glimmery gold fabric, with lavish gold jewelry and a gold chain belt. His most ironic style was a floor-length black chiffon gown with the letters VIP in gold down the front, with the V incorporated in the neckline. Over the next five days, forty of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s top ready-to-wear designers, including <PERSON> Armani </PERSON>, <PERSON> Versace </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Krizia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Biagiotti </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Missoni </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fendi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ferre </PERSON> will present their styles for next year's warmer weather. Along with beautiful clothes the fashion crowd will be treated to a night at the famed <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> house for a performance by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Bolshoi theater.

 A hummingbird that mysteriously ended up thousands of miles north of its normal range will be making the trip south by airplane, but its fate is still uncertain. The 3-inch Costa's, believed to be a year old, spent the summer and early fall feeding on fuchsias at a home on the edge of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. Other types of hummingbirds make their way to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, but the Costa's breeds in the southwestern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and usually heads to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> this time of year. The bird normally travels only as far north as <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` He's so cute. He's like a member of the family,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergt </PERSON>, whose bushes became the bird's adopted home. No one is sure how the hummingbird, with plumage of green and violet, got to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Zoo hummingbird specialist, said the bird most likely was ushered north by a weather system. Other possibilities are `` some kind of strange thing going on in his body,'' and there's even a remote chance the bird, which periodically goes into a dormant state, was on a household plant that got packed for a journey to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bergt </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Derril </PERSON>, grew concerned about the advance of winter and its possible toll on the hummingbird after it lingered week after week about 20 feet behind their home, so they called in the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Batten </PERSON>, information officer at the agency's office in <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, already had plans Tuesday to head through <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, for a seminar and decided to take the bird along in a shoebox-size container. He said he will release the Costa's in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> if a relay flight and escort to a point farther south can not be lined up. <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said she does n't know how the bird will fare in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> or whether it will fly south from there on its own. Mrs. <PERSON> Bergt </PERSON> said she also was worried. `` He could get hurt. He could not survive the shipping,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bergt </PERSON> said. `` But he has a better chance than he will have here.''

 Two fellow correspondents and I were following a column of several hundred pro-democracy marchers down a narrow street in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> early Sunday when riot police surrounded the protesters. Just as we realized we had been cut off, the police charged us, separating the column into small groups. One of the groups ran into a doorway and then into a courtyard where more police jumped out to grab them. One of the marchers was able to duck into an open doorway. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsumoto </PERSON> and I followed him in. We ran upstairs where we were hidden by a family that had seen us fleeing. The family concealed us for three hours at great personal risk. Police knocked on their door many times, threatening to break it down if they did n't open it. They refused. Our other colleague _ -LRB- <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ was arrested and taken to a police station in a suburb. We later found out that he was questioned for six hours and released. He told us that up to 1,000 people may have been arrested Saturday night and early Sunday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and that many were beaten while being detained. A fourth Western journalist _ <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Sunday Observer correspondent <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON> _ got away somehow. The demonstration started with about 7,000 people Saturday afternoon and continued with interruptions until around 1 a.m. Sunday. By then the police had brought in water cannon and used them on the few hundred people still left on the streets. The family that sheltered us consisted of a man in his 40s, a woman in her 30s and their child about age 10. The couple asked that their names not be published because of possible harassment by security forces. As we talked we heard screams outside of protesting crowds when the water cannon went into action, and police boots stomping on the cobblestone streets as police scattered marchers. Our host, who clearly was risking his job by hiding us, was deeply sad. `` It's a horrible shame that Germans are beating up on other Germans out of fear of change,'' he said. `` We need to discuss our problems, but what kind of discussion can you have when rubber truncheons are the strongest argument our government can offer?'' Both parents said they were white-collar workers and are intensely interested in current affairs. Their large apartment was filled with books on various topics. Tens of thousands of despairing East Germans have left their homeland for the West in the past two months, and there is a growing pro-democracy movement that is unwanted by the country's hard-line leaders The <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> couple was concerned about where their country was headed, and that violence might soon erupt again. The family offered us food, but we were too nervous to eat. We did accept their offer of some red wine and later, tea. The husband went over to a window, inspecting the backyard to see if there were any police there. There were none. But police were still milling around in front of the house. He said we would probably be able to get out safely if we left through a backdoor and walked through the backyard to a side street. We decided to try it and thanked our hosts for their help. I met up again with <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> on Sunday morning at the Grand Hotel, who said he was ordered to leave <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. He said he was n't beaten while detained but he was handled roughly until the police found out he was foreign correspondent <PERSON> Millar </PERSON> was first taken to the prison at <LOCATION> Ruemmelsburg </LOCATION>. Because the prison was already full he was then taken to a large detention facility at <LOCATION> Marzahn </LOCATION>. I escaped the beatings and arrests and have little to show as battle scars except a wrist sprained in a successful tussle with a state security agent for my tape recorder.

<HEAD>Automatic Fire Alarm System May Not Have Worked in Nursing Home Blaze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 There's evidence an automatic fire alarm system may not have worked when a blaze broke out last week at a nursing home, killing nine, authorities said. A preliminary investigation of the fire indicates the system _ which also is supposed to automatically close the building's fire doors _ never sent an alarm out of <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Convalescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, city Fire Marshal <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. The fire department instead heard about the blaze via telephone calls. `` There seems to be some confusion on whether the fire alarms worked correctly,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> McKain </PERSON>, vice president of the home. Nine of the home's 160 residents were killed and 98 injured Thursday when a 78-year-old patient accidentally tossed a match on his bed while smoking cigarettes in his second-floor room, in violation of the home's rules. The man was among those who died. `` It looks like the main alarm had not been tripped,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. He said Sunday that investigators were trying to determine if fire officials or anyone else reset the alarm after the blaze. The possible alarm malfunction also may have prevented fire doors in the nursing home from closing, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. Fire doors are ordinarily kept open with electric magnets until tripped by fire alarms, <PERSON> McKain </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said Sunday that investigators were still determining whether the fire doors did indeed fail to close. The fire was confined largely to one room, but thick smoke surged through other parts of the building, and most of the deaths were due to smoke inhalation. The automatic alarm system is linked to <ORGANIZATION> MGI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is supposed to relay calls to the city fire department. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> MGI </ORGANIZATION> officials had not indicated whether the alarm reached the company. Investigators planned to look at the company's records Monday, he said A woman who answered the telephone Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> MGI </ORGANIZATION> and refused to give her name said only one employee was authorized to answer questions about the fire, and he would not be available for comment until Monday. Two of the injured nursing home patients remained in critical condition Sunday at <ORGANIZATION> Sentara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, nursing supervisor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dadell </PERSON> said. A third was in serious condition and seven others were in satisfactory condition, she said. Firefighters were called to the nursing home by four telephone calls from employees to the emergency 911 line, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. But he stressed that firefighters were able to respond quickly. `` The fire still was confined to one room,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said Sunday. `` In a facility like that, if we can do that, we did good.'' The brick nursing home was not required to have fire sprinklers because it was built 20 years ago, but <PERSON> McKain </PERSON> said fire sprinklers will be added within six months. The nursing home had passed two state inspections this year and held fire drills each month. <PERSON> McKain </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Hillhaven </ORGANIZATION> held monthly fire drills as required by regulations, and a staff training session on evacuation techniques was held about two hours before the fire. Patients who were not injured in the fire were taken to other nursing homes.

 <PERSON> Claudio </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON>, musical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION>, was chosen Sunday to succeed the late <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> as chief conductor of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic orchestra. <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON>, 56, was selected in a secret ballot by the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic orchestra's 120 musicians and accepted the post in a telephone conversation, <PERSON> Anke </PERSON> <PERSON> Martiny </PERSON>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s chief cultural official, told reporters. <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON>, who will be only the fifth chief conductor in the 107-year-old state-subsidized <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philharmonic </LOCATION>, was not considered among the favorites for the post. Other musical luminaries, such as <PERSON> Lorin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barenboim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Riccardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Muti </PERSON>, were initially thought to have better chances in the musicians' first direct balloting for a new leader. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, who headed the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic for 35 years, died July 16 at age 81. The brilliant and revered maestro stirred millions of people with his music and was perhaps the world's most honored and prolific conductor. Austrian-born <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> resigned his `` conductor for life'' post in April after contract differences with the orchestra. <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, is considered among the world's top conductors and has made guest appearances with the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic since 1966. No date was immediately set for him to take up his new position, since he is still bound by contract to the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> opera. <PERSON> Martiny </PERSON> said negotiations `` will not be easy.'' But she added: `` A great musical future is opening up for <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON>, a member of an artistically inclined family, began studying piano, composition and conducting at <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>'s conservatory at age 16. He also took cello and organ courses, and his teachers included Viennese conductor <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Swarovsky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON> quickly rose to prominence in the 1960s, won prizes and led several European and American orchestras. Then he returned home, where he became chief conductor at <ORGANIZATION> Milan </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scala </ORGANIZATION> opera in 1968 and later musical director. He has been the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION>'s chief guest conductor since 1982, and he has long worked with the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philharmonic </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Symphony Orchestra. He has been musical director at the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opera </ORGANIZATION> since 1986. <PERSON> Abbado </PERSON> is known for his recordings of modern composers like <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartok </PERSON>, as well as innovative productions of operas like <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdi </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON>.'' In public statements, he rebelled against what he considered bourgeois hesitation to accept modern classical music though he was avowedly apolitical. He staged free concerts for Italian workers, saying he wanted to reach out to new audiences.

 Hard-line opponents of reform said Sunday that the national <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, dissolved by delegates to a party congress, still exists and its fate must be decided by its entire membership. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> delegates on Saturday voted to dissolve the party, saying `` its history ... has ended.'' The Communist Party, officialy called the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is to be replaced by the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, according to the congres resolution. Reform leaders said the new party would be similar to Western European socialist parties. It was the first time in the Soviet bloc that the leadership of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has decided to dissolve the organization. The move represents an attempt to draw support for multiparty national elections scheduled for June at the latest. But a ranking Communist conservative defied his party's decision Former Politburo member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> said Sunday the old party remains in existence until its entire rank-and-file decides on its fate. <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON>, ousted from the party Politburo by reformers several months ago, said, `` The membership still has to decide, and if the majority or a large section of the membership decides that they are members of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, then I am with them.'' He spoke in an interview on state television and did not elaborate. Another conservative, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribanszki </PERSON>, said he would organize a plebiscite among the 720,000 members of the old party to allow them to declare their party affiliation. `` The decision made yesterday was a great step backward in the history of the Hungarian left-wing movement,'' said <PERSON> Ribanszki </PERSON>. `` It's not the Leninist principles that were wrong but the way they were implemented.'' The hard-line <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> <PERSON> Society </PERSON>, named for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s former leader, announced plans to found a new Communist Party. Politburo member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Barabas </PERSON> suggested the courts may have to decide. <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Barabas </PERSON>, a reform member of the Politburo, was asked if the new <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could be considered the legal successor to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and he said the courts may have to decide. Some legal experts at the congress told reporters the new party was the legal successor because it was a child of the congress _ the old party's most authoritative body. The new party has invited into its ranks all members of the old party who agree with its principles. The new party's platform backs parliamentary democracy with competing parties and components of private ownership in the national economy. Vice Premier <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Medgyessy </PERSON> urged the successors of the dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to stop interfering in government business as <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> prepares for its first free elections in 41 years. <PERSON> Medgyessy </PERSON> told reporters he would like to see a `` government of experts'' run the country until the elections. He also indicated he believed to many conservatives may be allowed into the new party, saying, `` I am not convinced that the so-called cleansing -LRB- of ranks -RRB- that is necessary actually has happened.''

 State and federal investigators seized a mine company's log books, memorandums and computer printouts in their probe of a coal mine explosion that killed 10 miners last month. Agents of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> acted Friday and Saturday on search warrants issued by a judge for <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenster </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION>, said the company already had turned over most _ but not all _ records sought by investigators He said the company would have turned over the remainer if investigators had gone through proper channels. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnie </PERSON>, a special investigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said in a sworn statement submitted to a court Friday that workers removed a cinder-block barrier inside the western <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> mine about 15 minutes before the Sept. 13 explosion. That action disrupted air currents, creating dangerous levels of explosive methane, <PERSON> Finnie </PERSON> said. Pyro Mining said Saturday in a statement that the company did not violate federal mine-safety laws by making a ventilation change in the mine the day of the explosion. The company did not elaborate. Last month <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Siler </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Costain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, parent to <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION>, said a barrier was indeed taken down the morning of the explosion, but after the fatal blast, not 15 minutes before. And he contended that its removal could not have been a factor, even if it came before the accident. The company also denied <PERSON> Finnie </PERSON>'s allegation that employees apparently tore pages out of mine record books before giving the books to federal officials the day of the explosion. Investigators have said the explosion occurred after a spark _ possibly from a welder's torch or electrical equipment _ ignited a dangerously high concentration of methane.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> assessed the political damage Sunday of his pardons for military officers accused of human rights violations and found both support and angry criticism. `` President <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> had the courage to untie one of the most dramatic Gordian knots of Argentine life,'' <PERSON> Clarin </PERSON>, the country's largest newspaper, commented in an editorial `` This is not to say the presidential measure will be a balm that miraculously cures all wounds,'' it said, but `` he worked inspired by the common good.'' Other expressions of support came from members of the conservative Union of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s third biggest political party; a Roman Catholic bishop, military figures and <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. But human rights groups and leftist politicians and newspapers denounced <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> for pardoning 39 officers accused of kidnapping, torture and murder in the `` dirty war'' against suspected subversives during the 1976-83 military dictatorships. Thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> pamphlets were distributed saying, `` The killers and coup makers of today will be the repressors of tomorrow.'' At least 8,960 suspected leftists were arrested, never seen again and presumed executed, according to a commission appointed by former President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> whose election in 1983 ended military rule. Human rights groups put the total number of victims who disappeared at 30,000 or more. Congressman <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Storani </PERSON> of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, second in size behind the Peronists, accused <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> of appeasing the armed forces `` in case their intervention is necessary'' to quell protests against his economic policies. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, a 59-year-old former provincial governor, was held under arrest for nearly five years following the March 1976 military coup that ousted President <PERSON> Isabel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peron </PERSON>. He was elected president last May and took office on July 8 amid triple-digit inflation and rising unemployment. Opponents of the pardons said <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s action was too much in favor of the military. `` It is legitimite to desire that society be reconciled with itself. But this is not the way,'' <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Duhalde </PERSON>, director of the leftist newspaper `` <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sur </ORGANIZATION>,'' wrote in a column. `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has committed a grave error ... that in the end may devour him,'' <PERSON> Duhalde </PERSON> wrote. Reconciliation `` can never be based on forgetfulness ... putting on the same level victims and aggressors, killers and killed, martyrs and hangmen.'' Also pardoned were 174 officers accused of participating in three rebellions against <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> and three officers _ including ex-army commander and president <PERSON> Leopoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galtieri </PERSON> _ who were jailed for mishandling the 1982 Falklands War with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Capitol Hill Pay Raise In The Works</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While House leaders do n't like to publicly use the words `` pay raise,'' they are quietly shaping a scenario under which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can vote to increase its pay with bipartisan accord and the blessing of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Still smarting from the political fiasco last February under which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was forced by public outrage to reject a 51 percent raise, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leaders have agreed on a set of conditions for the next attempt to raise lawmakers' salaries. Foremost among them were that there will be a recorded vote and that the increase in pay will be coupled with a phasing out of speaking fees members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> receive from interest groups. The agreement, as outlined by a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership source who insisted on anonymity, also includes a demand for active White House support and a commitment from party organizations to refrain from using the pay vote as a political issue. Of course, there is no way individual challengers to members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> can be forced to refrain from making a vote for a pay raise a political issue. Rank-and-file lawmakers earn $ 89,500, and leaders get more. Any pay plan would likely also include raises for federal judges and top federal executives who also came out losers when the last pay raise was rejected. Congressional leaders in both houses have publicly kept mum about their plans for the politically explosive issue. `` We seldom whisper the words -LRB- pay raise -RRB-, except in closets, cloakrooms and bathrooms,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leadership source, speaking only on condition he not be named. But behind the scenes, there is movement. A bipartisan <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> task force has presented <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders a proposal for raising congressional pay up to 35 percent over two years _ an increase that would apply to the next <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal, never formally announced, would be coupled with a phaseout of honoraria _ the speaking fees often paid by groups seeking to influence legislators. There also would be changes in <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics rules and laws, including a tightening of financial disclosure, travel and outside income from professions and boards. Separate Republican and Democratic task forces have considered the issue in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but have not made any proposals and appear willing to let the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> move first. Republican leaders will accept those conditions, but also would like to tie a pay-ethics package to reform of campaign finance laws, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> source said. Congressional task forces are also trying to work out an agreement on that issue, but have not yet done so. `` Last time, the Republicans backed out at the last moment,'' the Democratic source said. `` This is going to be coming out of a bipartisan task force'' headed by Reps. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif. and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, R-Ill. House members were angry early this year when the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> quickly took a position against a pay raise, but privately expressed support for a raise without a `` Both sides need good assurance they will deal with it in the same spirit,'' the Democratic source said. In January and February, he said, `` The public felt something was cooked up that was n't being put on the record. This would be straightforward.'' The Democratic source predicted, `` Before the end of the session we will have some sort of ethics package on the floor. But it's not axiomatic that an ethics package would have to include pay and honoraria.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> source said chances for bipartisanship are much better, now that <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wash </LOCATION>., has replaced <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, as speaker Republicans have given <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> credit for hearing Republican views while <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was considered more partisan. `` Bipartisanship in this current climate is realistic,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> source said. `` Bipartisanship in the previous climate was not realistic.'' The House bore the brunt of the criticism last January when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> maneuvered for an immediate pay raise after members privately egged him on. Leaders initially wanted to let the 51 percent raise recommended by the presidential commission become law automatically, but at the end of January, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> abruptly switched tactics and decided to allow a vote. Both chambers overwhelmingly voted last Feb. 7 to reject the increase. Common Cause President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON>, whose congressional watchdog group pushed last January for a pay raise coupled with a phaseout of honoraria, said his organization would be active again in favor of both. The group's major interest has been elimination of honoraria, which <PERSON> Wertheimer </PERSON> called `` one of the most corrupting and corroding forces in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> source, close to the Democratic task force in that chamber, said `` We're not in this tricky procedural thing where you can play games. It has to pass both houses and be sent to president. Before, there were a lot of opportunities for mischief.''

 Gov. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> called Sunday for churches nationwide to join an adopt-a-family program to help <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> victims of Hurricane Hugo. `` We'll be back,'' <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said. `` With the spirit now in this state, with the help of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and with the help of God, we'll rebuild and we'll re-establish and we will endure. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> urged churches in other parts of the country to contact <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> affiliates for the names of families in need of assistance.

<HEAD>Suburban Chiefs of Police Want Credit for Cocaine Raid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chiefs of five small police departments have protested what they consider undeserved credit given to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police for the seizure of a record 19 tons of cocaine. At stake, the chiefs said in a letter to local newspapers and television stations, is due recognition of their efforts and shares of the $ 12.4 million in cash confiscated with the cocaine on Sept. 28. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that his department could expect up to $ 2 million of the $ 12.4 million for its role in the seizure. But police chiefs in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> played a minor role in the raid on a warehouse in <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION>, providing backup security while their investigators and federal agents searched the warehouse. Officers from five smaller departments and two federal <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agents did surveillance work that led up to the raid, the chiefs said. `` We feel that those cities that were actually responsible should get the credit, and along with that comes the money,'' <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Saturday. `` <ORGANIZATION> LAPD </ORGANIZATION> will get a share but certainly not the $ 2 million that Chief Gates spoke of.'' The chiefs also complained about the amount of attention local media devoted to Gates' role in the affair. Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police, said the media repeatedly ignored Gates' frequent praise for the smaller departments. Federal drug officials have not announced a formula for dividing up the money seized in the <LOCATION> Sylmar </LOCATION> drug bust, but said the money was deposited in an unidentified downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> bank. In most cases, a hearing is held before the assets are distributed to law enforcement agencies. A federal magistrate determines how much, if any, of the assets represent ill-gotten gains and should remain confiscated. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said the city would abide by whatever formula is used by the federal government.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> Monday after challenging <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s president to move his country toward full democracy and praying for reunification of the two Koreas. `` The Korean nation is symbolic of a world divided and not yet able to become one in peace and justice,'' the pontiff said Sunday, speaking alternately in Korean and English at an outdoor Mass attended by 700,000 people. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> told the vast throng of the faithful of his desire to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and he offered prayers for the people of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s communist nations, including <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, just 30 miles from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> At an earlier meeting with President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> presidential mansion, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> challenged the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leader to make every effort to eradicate any traces of authoritarian rule, a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who said there had been big steps toward democracy since he first visited <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> five years ago, told <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Koreans </ORGANIZATION> want full democratic rights and freedoms, according to <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>. `` This present visit enables me to note the strong desire of all your people to proceed along the way to ... a prosperous and tranquil civil life and to generous and fruitful cooperation with the other nations of the world,'' the pope told <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>. A statement by the presidential palace said the two leaders discussed the international situation and relations with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but it made no reference to domestic political issues. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has made considerable progress toward democracy in the past two years, and most Koreans agree they now have a large degree of political freedom. But the government still imposes restraints on left-wing and other radical groups, and hundreds of anti-government dissidents have been jailed for political activity in recent months. The vast crowd at the outdoor Mass waved white Korean flags and wept as the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> arrived at the immense asphalt plaza in southern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to celebrate the end of the 44th <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eucharistic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Many worshipers arrived before dawn. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> offered prayers for the people of communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, calling them `` our brothers and sisters.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> broke relations with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in 1957 and recognizes only its own `` <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>,'' which names its own bishops. The Vatican estimates there are 2 million Chinese loyal to the pope. A choir of hundreds sang hymns in <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> as the pope walked along a red carpet toward a four-story-high stage and altar, tiered with thousands of red, white, yellow and pink flowers and flanked by white, yellow and blue banners. Plainclothes South Korean security agents carrying attache cases containing machine guns ringed the stage and 11,000 police were deployed on the outskirts of the plaza. Those who attended the Mass had to go through metal detectors. About 2,000 priests, aided by 2,000 women in traditional Korean gowns, served Communion while 1,200 white doves were released as a sign of peace. Prayers were offered in Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, German, French, Korean, English and other languages. Cardinal <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said in his welcome that the church issued an invitation to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to send delegates, but they did not come. `` This indicates that the division of the mind is more painful than the division of land,'' he said. The Korean peninsula, divided in 1945, is the site of one of the world's most bitter ideological confrontations. The capitalist South and the communist North, which fought to a stalemate in the Korean War, are still technically at war and maintain huge armies along their 150-mile border. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> offered a prayer for reunification of the divided peninsula, a theme he stressed at two services Saturday. The pope arrived in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Saturday. After his visit to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, he will travel to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> island nation of <LOCATION> Mauritius </LOCATION>. He is to return to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> on Oct. 16.

<HEAD>Oakland Athletics Going to The World Series</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> won their second straight American League pennant on Sunday, beating the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jays </ORGANIZATION> 4-3 to win the divisional playoffs in five games. The Athletics, with the best record in baseball the last two seasons, will open the World Series at home next Saturday against the winner of the National League playoff, either the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cubs </ORGANIZATION>. Before Sunday night's game, <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> had a 2-1 lead over <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in the best-of-seven playoff. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> outpitched <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Stieb </PERSON> for the second time in the American League series as <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> became the first team to win consecutive league titles since the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> each did it in 1977-78. <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Rickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> stole the series and was named Most Valuable Player. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> got on base 14 times in 23 plate appearances andof the creditworthiness of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> or another credit-rating firm would be an important boost for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should it try to tap the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market as part of its modernization drive. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> returned to foreign bond markets for the first time in 70 years when it sold a debt issue in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> in January 1988. Since then it has sold five more bond issues in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, mostly to banks, for a total of about $ 850 million worth of borrowing, according to S & amp; P. But it has yet to attempt a bond issue in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. One reason is that it must first settle about $ 193 million worth of bonds sold by Czarist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to help finance <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> participation in World War I. After the 1917 revolution, the new Soviet government repudiated the bonds and has yet to make good on them. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, the Soviets are barred from selling bonds here until they settle this old debt. A 1986 settlement with <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> over a similar Czarist bond offering bodes well for negotiations now under way with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds, S & amp; P said. The credit rating agency said many problems stand in the way of assessing the investment risk of Soviet bonds. Among them are the unreliable and incomplete nature of Soviet government statistics, lack of comparability between some Soviet and Western economic data, and the lack of firm figures on total Soviet borrowings in the West. `` Right now, analyzing the Soviet economy is a game of estimations,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P analyst. `` It's a new frontier to some degree.'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> declined to comment on whether <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials have agreed to cooperate with a credit analysis should <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P decide to do one. But, he said, `` It's a little difficult to obtain that information without being able to talk to the government about it.'' A credit rating is important because it helps investors determine the chances that their money will be repaid when a bond come due. It also gives them an idea of the rate of interest they should require to tie up their money. Ironically, the attempts of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to restructure his nation's economy, called perestroika, could harm the country's once-sterling credit standing among Western bankers, who have loaned it money since the early 1970s. With perestroika has come instability and an economic downturn. `` The system that was in place gave bankers a lot of confidence in the Soviet government's ability to repay their obligations,'' <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> said. However, he said, it appears that much of the Soviet government's ability to adjust the nation's balance-of-payments figures in order to repay foreign debt remain in place. A book published earlier this year is skeptical of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s recent Western borrowing. `` The Coming Soviet Crash: <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s Desperate Pursuit of Credit in Western Financial Markets,'' contends that Soviet economic statistics are extremely unreliable and that assumptions about the nation's ability to repay its debt may be erroneous. The author, <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> researcher <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelton </PERSON>, also criticizes the popular belief that the West is accelerating <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms by loaning money. She contends that instead of reducing military spending or making other tough economic choices, the Soviets are looking abroad for the cash to pay for perestoika while preserving their military might. S & amp; P's chief competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has not rated the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> either, but it recently released a credit study of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, another East bloc nation undergoing economic liberalization. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> also has been selling bonds in the West. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s analyst <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Bemmelen </PERSON> said obtaining the required information about <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> took longer than the time spent for similar evaluations of Western nations. But he said his company is confident about the results. Though there were problems in obtaining government data about the domestic Hungarian economy, he said, `` most of the determinants of the creditworthiness are really in its relationship to Western countries.'' That type of information is available from several sources, he said, including international banks and exporters and importers. But <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Bemmelen </PERSON> said he could foresee additional problems in rating the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, such as valuing its huge gold holdings. The Soviet government does not disclose that amount.

<HEAD>Car Bomb Kills Senior Police Officer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A car bomb exploded Sunday in a town near <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, killing a senior police officer and wounding his wife, police reported. They also said <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police found a bomb hidden in a prison where most of the inmates are suspected terrorists and the explosive device was part of an escape plan. There was no claim of responsibility for the car bomb in <LOCATION> Lisburn </LOCATION>, 8 miles west of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said the explosion killed Superintendent <PERSON> Alwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and slightly injured his wife. The spokesman was unable to say if the <ORGANIZATION> Harrises </ORGANIZATION> were in the car at the time or if the car was parked or moving. Area residents said the victims were on their way to church when the bomb went off. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 51 and a 33-year veteran of the force, was the third senior policeman killed in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> this year. He had been on sick leave with a heart ailment. Two other high-ranking officers, Chief Superintendent <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Breen </PERSON> and Superintendent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, were shot to death by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in March as they crossed the border after a meeting with police in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> police said they found a four-pound bomb made of the plastic explosive Semtex hidden in a toilet at the high-security <LOCATION> Crumlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> prison, which holds about 500 prisoners. Most are awaiting trial on terrorism charges. A police investigator said, `` There is no doubt that this was a serious escape attempt and we are extremely relieved to have foiled it.'' During four hours of violence in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Saturday night 15 vehicles were hijacked and many were burned, police reported. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province where Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics 3-2, with the predominantly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The 20-year-old conflict has claimed more than 2,700 lives.

<TEXT>
 Comedian <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> says the staff of Republican mayoral candidate <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> is so `` incompetent'' that it's hard to know if `` they're running a campaign or they're running for their life. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> resigned under pressure from the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> campaign Sept. 27 after remarks that the rabbi-turned-comedian made about blacks and Jews were published in the Village Voice. `` I never saw a more incompetent group of people in my life,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> says of the <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> campaign staff in the Oct. 16 issue of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> magazine. `` They look like they do n't know if they're running a campaign or they're running for their life or they should be running for a bar on Second Avenue.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> as saying Democratic mayoral candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> `` looked like a black model without a job'' and that Jews vote for blacks because they `` are sick with complexes.'' In the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> magazine interview, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> complained about what he called a double standard that finds <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> guilty of racism when the candidate links <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` Yet when <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> connects <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, he's considered a political fighter,'' he said But <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said that `` twenty years ago, the white people were racists and the blacks were the victims. Today, it's exactly the opposite.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, star of the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> series `` Chicken Soup,'' also lashed out at Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and Jewish leaders. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s criticism of <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s remarks are `` like a Nazi calling a Jew a bigot,'' he said. `` Jews are professional victims who practically beg their persecutors to keep persecuting them,'' he said. Jewish leaders `` do this out of their own sick fears, their own persecution complexes.''

 Riot police attacked demonstrators in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Sunday, driving thousands of protesters from a pro-reform rally at a church and from a sit-in on a major avenue, witnesses reported. A number of people were injured and at least 30 people were detained in the police actions Sunday in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, witnesses said. No official reports were given. Paramilitary troops and police with attack dogs forced demonstrators into sidestreets as the protesters shouted `` We want freedom!'' and `` No violence!'' Residents held candles out their windows in support of the demonstrators. It was the second day of violence between police and anti-government demonstrators. Hundreds of people were arrested during demonstrations in the capital and five other major cities Saturday, which marked the communist country's 40th anniversary. About 5,000 people had been in or near <LOCATION> Gethsemane </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> during a pro-democracy vigil and an estimated 2,000 people staged a sit-in on the nearby Schoenhauser Allee after authorities blocked them from joining the church vigil, witnesses said. Thousands of the activists left the church area after successful negotiations between church officials and police to begin letting the demonstrators through police lines, witnesses said. Many then joined the protesters on the Schoenhauser Allee. However, police moved in to drive demonstrators into sidestreets several times, beating many of them with truncheons and clubs and using trucks with steel-mesh barriers in front, witnesses said. Many apartment dwellers lighted candles in their windows and on balconies to show solidarity with the demonstrators. A middle-age man who watched the action from his apartment window said: `` It's getting worse and worse. Someday soon, rocks and Molotov cocktails are going to fly.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> accused the Western news media of encouraging Saturday's protests. It refused to renew the visas of dozens of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> journalists who were in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> for the two-day visit of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that ended Saturday. The reporters were told to leave the city when their visas expired at midnight Sunday. Hundreds of injuries were reported as police swinging truncheons repeatedly charged demonstrators in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Saturday and early Sunday. Police punched, kicked, beat and dragged the protesters away, and roughed up Western journalists covering the demonstrations. At least one Western reporter, <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Millar </PERSON>, was detained for six hours. The East German protests were the largest since a workers' uprising was put down by Soviet forces in 1953 <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies have made him popular among many East Germans and protesters chanted his name and called for his support. Despite the growing unrest and the exodus of thousands of East Germans to the West, East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said during talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> Saturday that he would stick to his hard-line course. Also Sunday, a group of pro-democracy activists announced they had formed a <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The party's charter was signed by 43 people in <LOCATION> Schwante </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The group's charter calls for a `` rigorous democratization of state and society'' and says the party wants to `` work with all democratic initiatives, groups and people in our land.'' Leaders of the group indicated they would not immediately apply for the party to be legalized. A prominent reform group, Neues Forum or New Forum, was recently banned by the communist government. New Forum says it has grown from its original 30 members to more than 11,000. An estimated 15,000 people joined in pro-reform demonstations over the weekend in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Potsdam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jena </PERSON> and <PERSON> Plauen </PERSON>, according to West German television and witness accounts. The <ORGANIZATION> Hessischer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio station in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said 700 protesters had been arrested in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> alone, although witnesses said the number could be more than 1,000. Lutheran church leaders called for the release of the detainees and appealed for calm. ARD, a West German television network, showed television footage of helmeted East German police in riot gear charging demonstrators in the historic city of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, hitting them with truncheons even after the protest had been broken up. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> the official East German news agency called the protesters `` troublemakers.'' There were strong indications of support even from those who did not take to the streets. Apartment dwellers rushed to their balconies to urge on thousands of protesters with sparklers, cheers and applause. In a crowded, smoke-filled bar, a young <PERSON> East </PERSON> <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> shouted `` Happy Birthday police state.'' For three hours early Sunday, <PERSON> AP-Dow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> reporter <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Reichlin </PERSON> hid in the apartment of an East German family after he was chased by police when trying to cover the protests. The family risked prison sentences by refusing to open the door to the police. For the fourth straight day Sunday, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> barred Western tourists from entering <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Tourists were turned away after being told `` it is not possible today'' with no further explanation. The exodus of tens of thousands of East Germans via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> deeply embarrassed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s leadership during the weekend anniversary celebrations More than 48,000 East Germans have fled to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Sept. 11, when <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> defied its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> ally and opened its western border. From early Saturday until early Sunday, 941 East Germans reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, all via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, West German officials said.

<HEAD>Jewish Theater Vandalized in Reprisal for Convent Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A vandal threw paint on windows and walls of the Jewish State Theater over the weekend in an attack linked to the dispute over a Roman Catholic convent at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, police reported. The vandal painted the message, `` This is for the convent.'' Worshippers saw the damage as they arrived Sunday night to mark the beginning of Yom Kippur, the most solemn Jewish holiday, at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s only synagogue that is next to the theater. Police said the blue paint had been splattered on the building Saturday. The theater, created by the state shortly after World War II, presents plays in Yiddish, preserving a cultural remnant of what was once one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most vibrant Jewish communities. `` A lot of nasty and unexpected things have happened recently,'' said Rabbi <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Joskowitz </PERSON>, a survivor of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> who emigrated this year from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to serve as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s only rabbi `` Synagogue windows have been broken in <LOCATION> Lublin </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Czestochowa </PERSON>,'' he said. The rabbi said the violence was a result of controversy over the convent of Carmelite nuns on the perimeter of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> concentration camp in southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Franciszek </PERSON> <PERSON> Macharski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> agreed in 1987 to relocate the convent, but a 1989 deadline was not met and the Polish church said the agreement was not valid.

 A fire apparently ignited by an incendiary bomb broke out on a bus in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> Sunday, authorities reported. They said seven people were killed and at least seven were injured.

The bus driver, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Pataquiva </PERSON>, told the radio chain <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> that a man and a woman apparently left a bomb in the back of the bus and it exploded moments after they got off. Police said seven people were killed and seven injured, but local news reports said seven were killed and eight injured. `` Apparently the fire was caused by an incendiary bomb,'' a national police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. She did not elaborate. Police earlier said the noon fire appeared to have been caused by a short circuit in the vehicle's electrical system.. Radio station <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> reported that a policeman at the scene said the fire apparently started in a five-gallon plastic container of gasoline in the back of the bus No one has claimed responsibility for scores of bombings in Colombian cities since the drug traffickers and government declared war on each other in mid-August after the assassination of a presidential candidate. The killing was blamed on drug traffickers. Before Sunday's bus explosion there had been 148 bombings that killed at least 10 people and wounded 164.

 Communists at a historic congress have proclaimed their party's death and the birth of a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> aspiring to Western democratic ideals. But the difference between the old and the new remains unclear. A document approved overwhelmingly by the congress Saturday terminated the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ called the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ and proclaimed the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> its successor. It was the first time a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party formally terminated its existence. The move was part of preparations for the first free national elections in 41 years. On Sunday, the party daily <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> appeared without its customary title-page citation from the Communist Manifesto: `` Workers of the World Unite.'' Instead of the usual masthead proclaiming <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> the central paper of the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, Sunday's edition simply identifed it as a `` socialist paper. Although the congress document sought to define ideological and practical differences between the old and the new party, senior officials differed over what that really meant. Party Chairman <PERSON> Rezsoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, true to his role as a moderate, said the document served `` the rebirth of our party as a new left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' But Deputy Premier <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Medgyessy </PERSON> was less optimistic that the congress had managed to bury the repressive Leninist past and create a party in the Western democratic tradition. Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was truly new, he told reporters Sunday: `` I do n't see the signs of that, although I honestly would have welcomed it.'' Since the congress opened Friday, radical reformers have insisted that orthodox Communists would have no place in the new party. But members of the old party are also members of the new party _ at least temporarily. `` I am not convinced that the so-called cleansing -LRB- of ranks -RRB- that is necessary actually has happened,'' <PERSON> Medgyessy </PERSON> said. Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, a key reformer, told the <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> that any new party would have no room for `` those with blood on their hands'' from past Communist exceses. Membership is not automatically transferable. The position paper said those wanting to join the new party would first have to state their intentions in writing. But drastic language that would have barred Communist conservatives was watered down out of fears the majority would reject the document. The paper stated instead that the new party wants to `` call in its ranks all those who agree with its platform, agree with its ground rules.'' Such ambiguity has resulted in the unsual development of former Politburo member <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> _ among the most vehement opponents of reform _ asking to join the new party Saturday, just hours after he declared himself ready to be `` tied to the stake'' for his Communist beliefs. <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON>, whose moderate views make him the most acceptable candidate for the post of party president, told <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> he was welcome. It was a graphic demonstration of the new party's difficulties in breaking with the past <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> later confounded conference participants by declaring he wanted the issue of a new party put to the vote among all members of the old party. He said in the meanwhile, he would remain a member of the old party. In another indication that some orthodox Marxists feel the new party is not substantially different from the old, <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoch </PERSON> told the congress the <PERSON> Berecz </PERSON> faction was dissolving `` because we have accomplished our goal'' of saving the ideals of the old party. But there are striking differences, on paper at least, between the old and the new. The document condemned the old party's Stalinist excesses, stating that its successor `` separates itself from the crimes, -LRB- and -RRB- the principles and methods that were proven wrong'' during the 41-year tenure of the Communists that included the failed 1956 uprising _ the Soviet bloc's bloodiest revolt. The <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` wants to contribute to the development of a ... multiparty system parliamentary democracy,'' the document proclaimed. While expressing support of some state ownership, the document also called for private enterprise with minimal controls. Despite formal loyalties to Marxism-Leninism and the proletariat, the old party had gradually moved toward greater liberalism under former leader <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>. Amid growing dissatisfaction with the pace and extent of reform, <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON> lost his post in May 1988, opening the way to sweeping changes. The preponderantly reform-minded leadership allowed political opposition to flourish for the first time since the Communists consolidated power in 1948. It went even further in February, agreeing to hold the first free elections in 41 years and promising to abide by the results. The elections are scheduled for next June at the latest. The new party is expected to reveal its true nature well before then, as it elects local officials in the next few months. EDITOR'S NOTE _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahn </PERSON> is based in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and has covered East European affairs for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> since 1981.

 Another outbreak of violence struck this country at war with drug lords Sunday as fire blamed on a bomb killed seven people on a bus and the body of an army secretary was found riddled with bullets. There were no immediate claims of responsibility, but the attacks came in the midst of a 7-week-old war that drug traffickers and government officials have been waging. Also Sunday, there were accusations and denials over allegations that President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government explored possibilities of a truce with the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. The driver of the bus in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Pataquiva </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> RCN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> that a man and a woman apparently left a bomb in the rear that exploded moments after they got off. Police said seven people were killed and seven injured, but local news reports said seven were killed and eight injured. `` Apparently the fire was caused by an incendiary bomb,'' a national police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. She did not elaborate. Radio station <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> reported that a policeman at the scene said the fire apparently started in a five-gallon plastic container of gasoline in the back of the bus. Police said they found the body of Mrs. <PERSON> Nury </PERSON> <PERSON> Veelasquez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, private secretary of the commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, shot 18 times. Unidentified men dragged her from a taxi in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Friday and took her with them in their car, police said. Police said they found her body next to a car near the town of <LOCATION> Marinilla </LOCATION> about 8 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Authorities said they had no motive in the crime, but the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> has been active in confiscating property of suspected drug traffickers. Before Sunday's reports of violence, 148 bombings and other attacks blamed on drug traffickers killed at least 10 people and wounded 164 since Aug. 19, when the traffickers declared war on the government. The government declared an anti-drug crackdown Aug. 18, the same day leading presidential hopeful Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was assassinated. <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON>, a former interior minister, said in reports published Sunday that he acted as a go-between in truce negotiations between the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel and the government before the anti-drug crackdown began. The new interior minister, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON>, denied that the government had talks with drug traffickers. `` The government received a proposal and immediately answered ` no,''' he told reporters outside the presidential palace moments after being sworn in, replacing <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON>. Also sworn in Sunday was <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Salazar </PERSON> <PERSON> Manrique </PERSON> as minister of justice and <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Danies </PERSON> as communications minister. The report of the negotiations was published Saturday in the <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, an opposition-owned newspaper. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> backed the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> account in interviews published by two other <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspapers, <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Espectador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Valleho </PERSON> served briefly as interior minister in the 1970s when the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was in power. It is now in opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> report, the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel was ready to abandon its cocaine-processing business, turn over its arms, laboratories and airstrips and help the government fight other drug traffickers. In return, the traffickers asked for amnesty and guarantees not to be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION> said in the interviews that indirect negotiations that began in September 1988 between the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and the government ended after <PERSON> Galan </PERSON> was killed. Police said <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member slain while addressing a campaign rally, was killed by drug dealers. La Prensa's initial story Saturday on the purported negotiations between drug traffickers and <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government was seen as a challenge to the credibility of the president's declared battle against the cocaine barons. La Prensa claimed Barco had approved the contacts with the traffickers. `` This is going to generate a huge national debate,'' <PERSON> Fabio </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON>, an opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> senator, was quoted by <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Espectador </PERSON> as saying. `` It seems to me that the government continues to handle matters with a double morality.'' <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> has said repeatedly he will not negotiate with the drug barons. He has issued decrees allowing the extradition of drug traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the seizures of their property. Colombian authorities have already extradited one alleged <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel kingpin and have siezed hundreds of properties allegedly belonging to the cartel. Two of La Prensa's main owners are <PERSON> Misael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastrana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Belesario </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentancur </PERSON>, both former presidents and members of the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 The second of four voter-registration days for February's elections proceeded without incident Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Opposition representatives in one city said, however, that they would file a complaint about irregularities. Officials earlier had said they hoped to register 500,000 voters Sunday, but they had no figures available late in the day because information was incomplete from the 4,934 registration precincts. They said figures should be available by the middle of the week. In <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, 55 miles west of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, a representative of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said by telephone the group will present complaints about alleged registration irregularities committed by electoral officials. There were no immediate details. Before elections take place Feb. 25, officials hope to register 1.92 million Nicaraguans age 16 and older. Voter registration is taking place during the four Sundays in October. The government said more than 370,000 people registered to vote last Sunday on the first day of registration. It said registration was hampered in some rural areas last Sunday because of rebel activity, but no such incidents were reported this time. Soldiers were stationed at voter registration locations in rural provinces where anti-government guerrillas have been active, the government said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported three rebels and one government soldier were killed Saturday when insurgents attacked a military patrol in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nisperal </LOCATION>, 130 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Rebel attacks have been sporadic this year since a cease-fire was signed between the government and rebels known as Contras. Five Central American presidents agreed in August to resettle the Contras, most of whom are based across the border in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. In return, the Nicaraguan government has promised free elections and political reforms. The Contras have been fighting the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> since 1981. They claim the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' shift to the far left betrayed the revolution that ousted conservative President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in 1979, ending 42 years of family rule.

 Wildlife specialists squared off Sunday for a bitter fight over how to keep <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s fast-dwindling elephant population from vanishing forever into ivory piano keys and chess pieces. Delegates from more than 100 countries will meet until Oct. 20 at the biennial conference of the Convention on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fauna </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>, known as CITES. The conference began Sunday with strategy sessions and formally opens Monday. Although they will also consider the smooth-coated otter, the salmon-crested cockatoo and a Noah's Ark of other species, attention is focused on pachyderms and their valuable ivory. By some reckoning, the great lumbering African elephant, for many an unmatchable symbol of the wild, will survive mainly in zoos by the turn of the century.

 It is perhaps no small irony that a highly sought Japanese auto plant was built on a road known as the <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> Memorial Highway, memorializing a bitter <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defeat to the Japanese on a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> peninsula and the resulting `` death march'' in which thousands died. Or is it? The <LOCATION> Bataan </LOCATION> highway signs are down because of road improvements, but there are no plans to change the name of Ind. 38, the address of <ORGANIZATION> Subaru-Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is bringing as many as 3,200 jobs to the <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> area, Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Riehle </PERSON> said. `` It's a reminder, at least in my style of thinking, of the horrors of war,'' <PERSON> Riehle </PERSON> said. Do n't forget it was the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that helped rebuild Japanese industry after the destruction wrought by World War II, he said. `` You can say their success has been our success, too.'' The success or failure of the joint venture wo n't be known for years, but already <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> has succeeded in recruiting what will be its largest employer after <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, in spurring other development and in laying the groundwork for future expansion of the city. `` Projects that had been planned for some time in the future are being looked at and perhaps expedited,'' said <PERSON> Riehle </PERSON>, who has been mayor 17 years. Those projects include a 33 percent upgrade in the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant and extension of a 24-inch water main southeast of the city into an area that basically doubles the infrastructure for business. `` It gave the county a whole new system of expansion,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quick </PERSON>, a local property broker. `` Retailers are starting to look at this area much more closely.'' Ms. Quick is co-developer of <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, a 247-acre retail, office and warehousing development planned along Ind. 26 east of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> and a couple of miles north of the Japanese auto plant. The project predates the plant, but Ms. Quick can not ignore her new neighbor. `` The car plant was just great for us.'' Ms. <PERSON> Quick </PERSON> said she and others in the community believed at first there was no need for a huge auto plant that might upset the balance of an already thriving community with an unemployment rate of 3 percent. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the leader of local development efforts, said the joint venture offered the local economy diversification and high-paying jobs with good benefits. `` These are the best manufacturing jobs we could go after,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` It gets into fairness or equity. Not everybody wants to be a software engineer.'' The <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> area has lost many other jobs recently, including about 600 at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> and 250 each at <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> operations, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` Economic development is not a game. It is a deadly serious business, with human, family impacts. The deaths are not the issue; births are the issue. If you're creating jobs, your community will continue to prosper,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Nonetheless, the plant also has stirred some fear and prejudice. The Rev. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Malmgren </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, said the arrival of the plant fueled unfounded rumors that Japanese were buying a local country club to indulge their passion for golf. They were uglier aspects, too. Some people who got jobs at the new plant were isolated by former co-workers, <PERSON> Malmgren </PERSON> said. `` I think the big thing is fear that gets played on _ fear of the unknown, fear of things we have no control over,'' <PERSON> Malgren </PERSON> said. `` I do n't really believe the arrival of the Japanese is the issue. The issue is change that can no longer be handled. `` The Japanese became a lightning rod.''

 The Organization of <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday it will hold talks in December with the European Economic Community.

<HEAD>Arab Oil Producers Advised To Escalate Oil Exploration</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Arab petroleum-producing countries were urged by experts Sunday to increase exploration in order to boost reserves and prevent shortages in the next century. Current Arab oil reserves plus recoverable reserves and anticipated discoveries can satisfy oil demand until 2020, said <PERSON> Abdul-Aziz </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Wattari </PERSON>, assistant secretary-general of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. `` But a gap between supply and demand will then occur unless new reserves are discovered to help meet the accelerating demand for energy from hydrocarbons,'' <PERSON> Wattari </PERSON> said in an inaugural speech of a four-day seminar in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>. The four-day seminar on `` Deep Formations in the Arab Countries: Hydrocarbon Potential and Exploration Techniques,'' is the first of its kind in the Gulf and was organized by <ORGANIZATION> OAPEC </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Abu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dhabi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wattari </PERSON> told over 70 participants that world energy consumption has been increasing in recent years and was expected to continue rising in the coming years `` Increases in oil production and reserves should match that. And some oil experts forecast that oil production will peak at 75 million barrels per day in the year 2010,'' he said. Daily world oil output currently is 62 million barrels, of which the Arab world accounts for roughly 18 million barrels. He urged <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states to make use of new advanced exploration techniques developed in Western countries. <ORGANIZATION> ADNOC </ORGANIZATION> General Manager <PERSON> Sohail </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Mazroui </PERSON>, backing <PERSON> Wattari </PERSON>'s call, said expanded oil exploration was `` essential in order to guarantee the continuation of petroleum supplies at their current level. Experts believe there will be an increased global dependence on Arab oil as reserves of other oil-producing nations will vanish in the future.''

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> promised Sunday that the union's bitter strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will continue until a contract is reached. `` How long are we willing to go? One day longer than <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> told a solidarity rally attended by 1,500 miners and retirees and their families. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> has been striking <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> since April in a contract dispute over health and insurance benefits. Miners from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> attended the rally pledging to continue selective strikes against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> and other companies the union says supplies the nation's second largest coal exporter.

But <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the union has enough money to continue the strike. `` We have ample resources to take care of our strikers indefinitely,'' said <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>.

 Top Kuwaiti officials on Sunday urged major industrialized nations to play a key role in resolving the debt problem of the Third World. <PERSON> Abdul-Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Atiqi </PERSON>, adviser to the emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and a former oil and finance minister, accused the industrialized nations of `` fraudulence'' and warned that the `` political aspect'' of debt was being overlooked. <PERSON> Atiqi </PERSON> addressed a symposium attended by about 400 prominent economists and bankers from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which consists of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. Market solutions to the international debt crisis is one of the topics being discussed at the symposium, which focuses on the impact of globalization of markets on the <ORGANIZATION> GCC </ORGANIZATION> countries. `` What the creditor rich countries are proposing for resolving the debt crisis is nothing more than fraudulence aimed at shackling the states of the Third World and absorbing their resources,'' <PERSON> Atiqi </PERSON> said. `` The rich countries did not grant loans to poor developing countries out of compassionate motives, but rather for winning them as subservient states that rotate in their orbits, to become markets for their goods and test fields for their weapons of destruction,'' he added. The emir of <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, has launched an initiative for alleviating the indebtedness problem of the Third World, a plan Atiqi called more favorable.

He also called for an international conference on resolving the international debt crisis.

<HEAD>Generic Drug Maker Complies With FDA Call To Recall Medication</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pharmaceutical maker on Sunday voluntarily began the recall of a generic antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections a day after the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> requested the action. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> contends that <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Copiague </LOCATION>, cheated on product safety tests when it submitted the drug, nitrofurantoin, for <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, president of the company, said in a statement that the recall of the 100 mg capsules was in response to questions raised by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> is concerned first with the ongoing well-being of the people who use our drugs,'' <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said. `` The charges that have been made against this product and our company warrant this cautious move on our part while we investigate to determine where the truth lies.'' An <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> investigation found indications that <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> substituted the brand name drug Macrodantin for its generic version in tests three years ago to win approval of the generic product, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbit </PERSON> said. `` We believe that this occurrence is not of <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s doing,'' <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said, adding that the product tested by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> was not the same product it provided for laboratory testing. Because of the evidence of a substitution, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> contends it is not possible to determine whether the <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> product is equivalent to the brand-name product, which is made by <ORGANIZATION> Norwich-Eaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceuticals </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>, which is the largest of the generic drug makers under <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny, won approval for its generic version of nitrofurantoin in June 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION>'s product is the only generic drug approved as therapeutically equivalent to Macrodantin, although other dosage forms of nitrofurantoin are available. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> also is investigating other generic drugs made by <ORGANIZATION> Bolar </ORGANIZATION> as part of its probe of more than a dozen generic drug companies in the wake of allegations of fraud and corruption within the industry and <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s generic drug division.
