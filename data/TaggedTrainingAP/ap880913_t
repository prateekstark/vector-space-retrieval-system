<HEAD>AP Board Approves 4.4 Percent Assessment Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The board of directors of The Associated Press approved unanimously a 1989 general assessment increase of 4.4 percent for newspaper and broadcast members. The increase takes effect Jan. 15, 1989, for <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,463 newspaper and 5,700 broadcast members. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> board chairman and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, noted that the increase was below inflation estimates of 5 percent to 5.5 percent for next year. `` The increase continues the recent trend of assessment adjustments less than the general rate of inflation,'' he said Tuesday. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said `` stringent cost controls and new revenues from nonmember sources'' enabled the board to restrict the increase to 4.4 percent and still fund major service improvements now under way. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed operating and capital budgets were examined by the board on a detailed, line-by-line basis. The budgets provide for expansion of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s news staff, mostly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to help meet the needs of <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s 28 percent increase in newspaper membership over the past five years, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said. The budgets also provide support for the new high-speed PhotoStream and GraphicsNet systems, as well as for total replacement of editing systems in all domestic bureaus. The general assessment increase will be combined with the fifth step of the phase-in of the circulation-based newspaper formula for those not yet on card with the new formula, which was adopted in 1985. Changes in circulation will also be reflected in the new assessment for each newspaper member. Each member will receive exact figures on the assessment change in October, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>School Board President Says He Lies To Uncover Leaks</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES throughout with mayor removing board president,
comments from Hollis new conference.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> removed the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> president on Tuesday after he admitted lying to board members as a way of finding out who leaks stories to the media. <PERSON> Meldon </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, who was appointed by the mayor to a one-year term as board president in December, will remain on the board. The mayor appoints the nine board members, who serve as volunteers. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, an attorney, admitted earlier Tuesday that he used poor judgment in planting three different versions of a story to track down news leaks and said that he would resign if the mayor asked him to. `` Whether or not I retain the public confidence ... is ... a matter for the public to decide, for the mayor to decide and for the school board to decide,'' <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> called <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>' actions `` a terrible mistake in judgment.'' `` My view is that the public can tolerate an official being wrong on an issue,'' <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said. `` What people generally find intolerable is an official lying to them.'' Tape recordings of <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>'s remarks Monday to the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a political club, show he said he leaked false information to school board members `` to see if they were lying to me.'' `` I know who's doing the lying,'' he said in the speech. `` I know who it is. I feed them the lies, then they run out and lie to the press.'' <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said Tuesday he could not recall using the word `` lie'' in describing the way he released information on how candidates for school superintendent would be interviewed earlier this year. He said he believed leaks were undermining the selection process, because some candidates threatened to withdraw if their candidacies were made public. He said he had become a political target and the object of news leaks because of his attempts to uncover favoritism in the awarding of grants in the school system. Board member <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON> said Tuesday that he was bewildered by <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>' remarks. `` I think there's something wrong with the man. I do n't even know what he's talking about,'' <PERSON> Gutman </PERSON> said. `` The whole thing is getting uglier and uglier. We are trustees -LRB- with -RRB- the most important responsibility in the city.'' Some board members, <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said, `` walk out of meetings and tell you we have a deal and then before I can get to my office the press is calling me asking me ` did you all decide so and so.' `` I know who they are. I know who is doing the leaking. I know who is doing the lying. That's OK. It will be taken care of in time,'' <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> acknowledged dissension within the board. However, he took issue with an article in Monday's editions of The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun, which said the school board was in a revolt. Problems arose last spring between <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> and board members when they were prevented from participating in the selection of a new school superintendent. Problems resurfaced in July when <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON> decided to hire a new executive director and several board members said they felt the full board should have voted on the post.

<HEAD>House Of Reptiles Will Be Limited To Four Snakes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A new law prompted by <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s slithering, squeaking menagerie is forcing him to get rid of 146 of his snakes. Responding to neighbors' complaints about living next door to a house filled with 150 snakes _ and several hundred rats and mice needed to feed them _ the municipal council voted Monday to limit to four the number of snakes or rodents in a household. `` They do n't belong in a residential neighborhood; in an urban setting, 150 of anything is too much,'' said <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keryluk </PERSON>. `` I would n't want to live next door to a house where I know there are snakes or rodents in large numbers.'' <PERSON> Keryluk </PERSON>, co-chairman of the council committee that proposed the bylaw amendment, said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> keeps his reptiles and rodents in cages. `` The concern in the neighborhood is about the rodents or the snakes breaking loose,'' he said. `` What if an uncaring person were to break into his house and kick some of the cages apart?'' <PERSON> Alf </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who lives across the street from <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, said he complained about the snakes 2 -LCB- years ago after he found one in his yard. `` It was over 6 feet long and had a head about the size of an orange,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` It was sunning itself half on the wall of my patio and half on the ground.'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> has a large variety of snakes, but <PERSON> Keryluk </PERSON> said he believes none is venomous. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> did not return messages left on his home answering machine. The amendment to the animal regulation bylaw, which excludes pet stores and schools, also prohibits venomous snakes.

 <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON> and others hook pilots and engineers to monitors while they fly. They hope to see whether crew members make more mistakes when such physical signs as body temperature and heartbeat suggest they are less alert. Much of that data is still being collected and analyzed. But <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON> said it's clear that by the third night of such schedules as the San Francisco-London-Seattle tour, the cockpit crew becomes increasingly lethargic. Dr. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Carskadon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> has shown in the laboratory what <PERSON> Graeber </PERSON> sees in the cockpit: The effects of lost sleep accumulate over time. `` Most people, particularly those who are trained as pilots are, can cope with the effects of chronic sleep deprivation fairly well most of the time,'' she said. `` But ... a vulnerability is set up that puts them at risk for catastrophic events to occur.'' Experts say that when people are tired, they become sloppy. Motivation flags, inertia sets in. They take short-cuts and ignore small details. Flying a big plane, however, is mostly a matter of paying attention to small details _ setting instruments, following checklists, getting weather reports, watching dials. `` It's the errors of omission that occur because of lapses in attention that are the hallmark of fatigue-related accidents,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Such omissions would include not `` noticing an indicator that's not right, anticipating a problem before it occurs, thinking many steps down the line,'' he said. Sometimes pilots and flight engineers fall asleep. On long cruises, especially over oceans, this is not terribly dangerous as long as someone in the cockpit stays awake. But sleep is contagious. The sleep experts say their research has turned up many tales of entire crews nodding off. Another concern is micro-sleep, a shadowy state in which people are half asleep. With the brain waves of sleep intruding on those of wakefulness, people in this condition can continue to perform duties while only vaguely aware of what's going on around them. `` It's much worse than being, frankly, fully asleep, because they can continue to carry out routine tasks,'' said <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON>. `` If they were truly asleep, someone else at least might notice.'' These problems occur, in part, because jet travel ignores the circadian timekeeper, the product of millions of years of evolution on a planet rotating once each 24 hours. Each day, the clock oversees a symphony of changes in body temperature, alertness and hormonal secretions, all of them geared to roughly a 24-hour cycle. For most people, the daily swing reaches its low point from 3:30 to 5 a.m. This is when they are sleepiest. There is another, less pronounced, valley of drowsiness in the afternoon from 4 to 5. The body temperature is also lowest at these times. Consider the pilot who leaves <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on a late-night, cross-country flight. Even if he slept during the day, he's likely to feel sleepy early in the morning as his body temperature falls. By the time he checks into a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hotel, his body temperature is rising again _ his body clock is telling him to wake up. Even though he is tired, sleep is difficult. He awakens feeling ragged and has to fly again. `` The pilot who flies across multiple time zones faces the problem that his body continues at the old time zone,'' said <PERSON> Dinges </PERSON>. `` He is forced to try to sleep when his body clock wants him to be awake and to be awake when his body clock wants him to sleep.''

<HEAD>Meese Attorney Says Ethics Office Impugns Former Attorney General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A lawyer for <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> says the former attorney general's reputation has been impugned unfairly by a <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> memorandum on <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that declares that `` simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the mark of public service.'' Ethics office director <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said Monday that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> failed to meet federal ethics requirements by hanging onto $ 14,000 in telephone stock and by assisting longtime friend <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>'s based his memo on the results of a criminal investigation completed this summer by independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> declined to prosecute <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, he concluded that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> probably broke federal conflict-of-interest laws twice by handling matters affecting the telecommunications industry at the time he held the phone stock. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> declared he had been vindicated because he had not been prosecuted. But <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said: `` A major purpose of this memorandum is to remind and inform that simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the mark of public service.'' The critique was sent to ethics officers in the federal government. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, said in a statement: `` We are dismayed'' by <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>'s memo, that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s `` integrity and reputation have been unfairly impugned.'' <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> `` apparently read the McKay report,'' but not the rebuttal to it filed by <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers. In it, they said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s behavior had met the highest ethical standards. <PERSON> Rocap </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> had rejected a request to meet with <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s attorneys. A letter last Wednesday from <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s lawyers said the findings would be based on `` undisputed facts'' and that the request for a meeting was therefore being denied. <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> also may have violated a presidential executive order on ethics and accompanying regulations, a question under review by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s office of public responsibility. The executive order says federal employees should avoid any action which might create the appearance of, among other things, using public office for private gain, giving preferential treatment or adversely affecting the confidence of the public in the integrity of government. `` There is no more clarion standard ... than that which exhorts an employee to avoid any action that adversely affects the confidence of the public in the integrity of the government,'' <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> said. `` While Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s personal reputation could not but have suffered as a result of this investigation, the public's confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> has also suffered One need only look at the well-publicized personnel resignations in the department to see why this standard is at issue.'' Concerned over the impact <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure was having on the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> resigned in protest in March. <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> promised in 1985 when he became attorney general to sell the phone stock because it presented a potential conflict of interest. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> listed the stock on subsequent financial disclosure forms as having been sold. In reality, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, without informing the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the ethics office, transferred the stock to his financial manager, <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, who is under indictment along with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> attorney, on charges of racketeering in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> finally retrieved the stock and sold it last year after he came under criminal investigation. In addition, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s agreement with the ethics office stipulated that he would remove himself temporarily from any matter involving <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a longtime friend of the attorney general who had represented him in an independent counsel's investigation in 1984. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was owed legal fees as a result. But during the period <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had agreed to recuse himself from involvement with matters concerning <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> telephoned then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to arrange a meeting for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> in connection with a proposed $ 1 billion Iraqi oil pipeline. `` This office did not accept Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s ethics agreement lightly, does not accept his failure to comply with it lightly and will not accept other nominees' agreements lightly in the future,'' <PERSON> Nebeker </PERSON>'s memo said. `` These agreements serve an important purpose not only for the individual involved but for the public. This investigation of Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> is a stark example of the results of inattention to such an agreement by an official.''

 Today's federal rules for pilot rest and duty hours come out of the era of the DC-3, when propeller-driven airliners droned along at speeds less than 200 mph and took eight hours to fly from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Revised in 1964 and again in 1985, many of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulations </ORGANIZATION> differ little from rules first issued in the 1930s. Crews for large airlines on domestic routes ca n't be scheduled to fly longer than eight hours between required rest periods. They ca n't fly more than 30 hours in seven days; 100 hours a month and 1,000 hours a year. Crews may exceed the eight-hour limit if their scheduled flights are delayed by weather, traffic or equipment problems. Commuter airline pilots may fly 34 hours in 7 days; 120 hours in a month and 1,200 a year. Crews must be given at least nine hours' rest in a 24-hour period. However, that can be cut to eight hours if the next rest period is increased by two to three hours, based on an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> formula. Three-member international crews can fly up to 12 hours a day; they must get 18 hours' rest if they fly more than 24 hours in 72 hours or 20 hours within 48 hours. Larger crews can fly longer; two-member crews can fly only eight hours between rest periods. However, the rules do n't speak to duty hours _ measured from the time a pilot reports to the airport, usually an hour before first takeoff, through the day's schedule including sitting on the ground between flights, to departure after the final flight. Such reckoning can stretch a crew's time on the job to 16 hours. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> limit their pilots' hours by calculating duty time, the number of takeoffs and landings, the time of day and the number of time zones crossed None of these factors is considered under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commercial regulations. The latest <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rules are the result of so-called `` regulation by negotiation.'' Union and airline representatives met in 1983-84 with <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials and a mediator to work out minor changes in domestic rules. These rules are often used by airlines and their unions as a baseline for schedules stricter than government guidelines. `` Our own rules go on beyond the FAR -LRB- federal air regulations -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hof </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight operations. `` We find the FAR is a place to begin.'' <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> strongly denies federal regulations run second in safety to union contracts. `` Our standard is not the thinnest ice you can skate on,'' he said. Yet in 1975 an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigation of a series of Pan American crashes in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> raised questions about the adequacy of <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. Dr. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON>, then chief of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s Aeromedical Applications Division, suggested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulators look to the factors that the Europeans use to set flying limits. `` It was the feeling at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to leave it up to the unions to negotiate relative to their airlines' specific type of flying,'' said <PERSON> Mohler </PERSON>, now head of aerospace medicine at <ORGANIZATION> Wright </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seemed to make sense, up until deregulation.'' With deregulation, airlines stretched into new markets, added new routes and faced new competition. Efforts to cut costs and keep fares low put pressure on various parts of the industry, including the pilots. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Airline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the average pilot flies 13 percent more each month today than 10 years ago. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> says he has an open mind to change. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is supporting fatigue research being done by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> on several airlines. `` I do n't know of any carrier that wo n't voluntarily do all they can to ensure efficiency in the cockpit,'' he said. `` But I do n't believe we know all that we will know about this phenomenon As we understand it better, the scheduling, I think, will reflect that.''

<HEAD>Consumer Group Attacks Proposed Change on Hot Dog, Sausage
Labeling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A consumer group says it will fight to retain federal rules requiring food processors to acknowledge when finely ground bone is used in hot dogs, sausage and other meat products. <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, decried an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposal issued Monday that would require that such ingredients as ground bone be included on package labeling only when the material exceeds 10 percent of the meat portion of the finished product. Under current regulations, so-called mechanically separated meat or MSM can comprise up to 20 percent of the meat portion of certain products, which include hot dogs, luncheon meats, sausage, scrapple, canned spaghetti with meat sauce and other items. But labels must state that the product contains MSM. The department said that if the new proposal is adopted, <ORGANIZATION> MSM </ORGANIZATION> used in meat and poultry products `` would not have to be listed in the ingredients statement on the label as long as it does not exceed 10 percent of the meat and poultry portion of the finished product.'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said the proposed rule change was `` politically motivated'' by the outgoing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, which he said could have made the proposal long ago. `` They want to get all of the junk and crud and sleaze done before they leave -LRB- office -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> said. He said his Washington-based consumer group would challenge the proposal during the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> hearing process. MSM is produced by putting the bones and attached meat remnants of a slaughtered animal through a grinder and forcing the mixture through sieves. Although most of the bone is strained out, some small particles _ about the size of black pepper flakes _ wind up with the salvaged meat in the final mixture. Mechanically deboned meat has been approved for use in certain foods since 1978. However, the industry complained that the stricter initial regulations called too much attention to the finely ground bone, and the product failed to gain widespread use. Department officials said the proposal to allow up to 10 percent <ORGANIZATION> MSM </ORGANIZATION> in products without labeling `` reflects a petition submitted to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'' by four processors: <ORGANIZATION> Bob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Odom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sausage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Owen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sausage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The proposed change in regulations will be open for public comment until Nov. 8. Those can be sent to: Policy Office, Attn: <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, Hearing Clerk, <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, Room 3171-S, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20250.

 An unlikely coalition of wealthy housewives and cattlemen is spearheading opposition to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s first nuclear power plant The plant, <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, has been a pet project of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for more than 20 years. But the party, which lost ground to the opposition in the July 6 general election, announced soon afterward that it was delaying the plant's startup. `` After July 6, nothing is the same,'' said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON>, a founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Mothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veracruz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, one of several groups that have been working to get the plant mothballed or converted to non-nuclear fuel. The coalition of urban housewives and cattle ranchers fighting the project includes members of the governing party. `` A social consciousness is growing in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. One point is nuclear energy,'' said regional planner <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, who just finished a book critical of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>. `` In it you will see a new face of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' Many residents in <LOCATION> Xalapa </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, oppose the plant, which is located 40 miles outside the city on a winding road dotted with roadside stands laden with local honey, cheese and fruit. Thick stands of sugar cane carpet the steamy coastal plain where white power pylons march down to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the green lagoon that gave its name to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s first nuclear plant. Inside the 13-story Unit One containment building, uranium fuel rods wait in a dry concrete pool next to 657-megawatt reactor from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The men who are building the plant say they are confident of its safety and are ready to turn on the first of two reactors. `` The first unit is ready. It's a political decision now,'' project spokesman <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Luna </PERSON> <PERSON> Lastra </PERSON> said recently. Critics say the reactor, made by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and its containment building are dangerous and obsolete. The <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which had a reactor of the same design, is being converted to coal fuel. The owners sued, alleging the reactor design was flawed, and won an out-of-court settlement of more than $ 78 millon. The Union of Concerned Scientists says all similar plants should be phased out because the containment building could leak radioactive materials. `` The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has concluded there is a 90 percent chance that it -LRB- the containment building -RRB- will break if there is a meltdown,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON>, a nuclear safety engineer, said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> is all that is left of a grand plan for a nationwide network of 20 nuclear plants. The idea died when oil prices plunged, but <PERSON> Laguna </PERSON> <PERSON> Verde </PERSON> lived on, despite a price tag that rose from $ 263 million to $ 3.5 billion. The project was announced in 1968. Construction began in 1973, and for years the project moved quietly along, providing thousands of jobs. Opposition to <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> began in April 1986 after the nuclear accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, another founder of Mothers of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION>. The explosion and fire at the Soviet plant killed 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation around the world. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electricity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> countered criticism of <LOCATION> Lagunda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> with a public relations campaign, but the opposition kept growing. Mothers of <LOCATION> Veracruz </LOCATION> turned a group of traditional Mexican housewives into a feisty band of activists that sent telegrams to public officials, organized phone banks and printed booklets about nuclear energy. `` Waking people up, waking people up. That's been the hardest thing. To make them realize you can do something,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Labastida </PERSON> said. Local cattlemen joined in, some even offering to help pay to turn <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> into a non-nuclear plant. Last year, cattlemen and housewives blocked traffic by linking arms across the road leading to the plant. The plant has two reactors, one ready to be started up. The governing party did n't say how long it would delay that procedure.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should develop new proposals for U.S.-Soviet conventional arms control talks in case Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> succeeds in cutting back on military spending, says a key congressman. The plans should be prepared even though there's no indication <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has yet been successful, said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` A central element of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ` new thinking' is that the Western threat can be reduced by political means _ that is, arms control _ which then reduces Soviet defense requirements,'' the report said. `` For <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, arms control can cut the size of the Western threat and a revised military doctrine can scale back the military's response to that threat,'' it said. The panel's defense policy subcommittee concluded Monday that `` to date, there have been no significant, identifiable changes traceable to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to scale back defense spending.'' The study by the Democratic-run panel was based on a series of hearings, including testimony from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and other experts in government and private industry. Republican members of the panel issued a dissent, disputing the majority's implication that the Soviets may be moving away from what the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> legislators said is a drive to achieve nuclear superiority over the West. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called for economic and military reforms aimed at shifting more spending into consumer goods and away from the huge Soviet military structure, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> noted. `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform agenda for the military is driven primarily by domestic concerns, not military or strategic factors,'' the study said. `` The equation is simple: In order for his economic reforms to succeed, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> must shift resources from the defense sector to civilian use.'' The current five-year plan began in 1986 and was developed before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power in March 1985, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said at a news conference. Some changes may be seen in the Soviets' next five-year plan, he said. `` There is a growing consensus among the experts that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> intends to shift some of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s economic capacity from military to civilian use,'' said <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>. `` What the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ought to be doing is probing. ... We should move cautiously and carefully, but we should move,'' he said. `` We need some concrete proposals in conventional arms.'' He was referring to the long-stalled talks aimed at reducing non-nuclear weapons and troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The upcoming `` year we're looking at is a critical year,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` It's too bad the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is in transition.'' As the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration winds down, no new proposals are likely. In addition, a new administration will take six to eight months to prepare its plans, no matter whether Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is elected president, <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have a difficult time estimating Soviet military spending, since the Soviets do n't publish details about their programs. The Soviets appear to be spending about 18 percent of their gross national product on defense, compared to about 6 percent for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the study said. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> GNP is much larger. Soviet military spending increased about 2 percent annually in the decade before <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power, and has increased about 3 percent in each of the past two years. The study cited the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces -LRB- INF -RRB- treaty, which includes strict verification procedures and bigger cuts in the Soviet arsenal than in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stockpile of weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> minority, led by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., the ranking Republican on the committee, criticized part of the report `` This report accepts, without the slightest qualification, the idea that the Soviet leadership has accepted the implications of nuclear parity _ implicitly meaning that the Soviets reject the concepts of superiority, pre-emption, first use and victory,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> members said. `` The apparent justification underlying this assumption appears to be a decade of both Soviet public statements and arms control activities. However, neither can be taken at face value as evidence of a meaningful transformation in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear doctrine,'' the dissent said.

<DATELINE>BANCHHARAMPUR, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the past two weeks, the 15,000 people of this town have been living in flood waters. They say they have received almost no help from the government, although the town is only 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the capital. Even in normal times, <PERSON> Banchharampur </PERSON> is isolated, like thousands of other towns and villages in this country that is now three-quarters submerged by overflowing rivers. There are no roads connecting the town to the outside world. The trip from <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> takes five hours by motorboat across winding rivers and through inundated rice paddies. Most people in <LOCATION> Banchharampur </LOCATION> are weavers or landless farmers who have not been able to work since the flood waters from the <LOCATION> Titash </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reached their houses Aug. 29. <PERSON> Firoz </PERSON>, who delivers goods from the market when it is n't flooded, and his wife <PERSON> Hana </PERSON>, said they tried to get medical help for their 7-year-old daughter <PERSON> Rahima </PERSON>, who had a fever. `` Government medical workers came here once, but the crowd was too big and they left before we could see them,'' <PERSON> Firoz </PERSON> said. Townspeople said eight people drowned or died of diarrhea or dysentery caused by drinking contaminated water. He said his family had received 4.4 pounds of free rie from the government, and had to borrow money from other villagers to buy more. A grain seller named <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> said he had only two baskets of low-quality rice to sell. The government and foreign relief agencies are struggling to reach millions of marooned flood victims by helicopter and boat. But with at least 65,000 villages spread across 55,000 square miles _ an area the size of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> _ the task is slow. On Sunday, fresh vegetables reached Banchharampur by boat from unsubmerged fields 12 miles away, but the prices had soared by as much as 175 percent since the floods began June 13. <PERSON> Sattar </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> and their three children normally eat 4.4 pounds of rice a day. Since the flood, the family has been getting by on 2.2 pounds or less of rice a day, <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> said. She uncovered a tin cooking pot, displaying an inch of rice in the bottom. `` This is all we have left. We have no more money,'' she said, speaking in Bengali through an interpreter. The family has purchased rice with <PERSON> Sattar </PERSON>'s last earnings as a porter, and money from the family's only salable item _ a chicken <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> managed to save when they abandoned their straw house, where the flood water has reached the roof. `` We stayed in our house until the water got as high as <PERSON> Saliha </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> said, drawing her oldest child close to her. <PERSON> Saliha </PERSON>, wearing only a pair of cotton shorts and a jewelry stud in her nostril, stood about three feet tall. <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> _ who like many Bangladeshis does n't have a family name _ said she did not know her daughter's age, but the girl appeared to be about 10. <PERSON> Alia </PERSON> said her family took refuge with 20 other people in one room of a hostel built for college students, where the water was 18 inches deep. The families piled wooden benches on top of each other in two tiers, creating a wobbly wooden platform above the water. The highest path through the village is a foot under water. Some people are living in houses where women wade waist-deep in water to cook food on boards propped just above the water. But life in the village went on. The government-run bank was open, although the few customers stood ankle-deep in water. At the deed registry office, clerks sat on platforms above the water with a black goat tethered in their midst.

<HEAD>Even Without Biaggi, Congressional Office Carries On</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> office for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 19th Congressional District, phones still ring, mail comes in, letters go out. The only thing missing is a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Until Aug. 5, the district was represented by Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, a Democrat who for nearly 20 years represented the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and part of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, who was convicted of racketeering last month in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> trial, resigned rather than face almost certain expulsion by his colleagues. But even without an elected representative, the work of the congressional office goes on. House rules provide for keeping offices running in the event that a member resigns, dies or is expelled. Constituents still get some services; what they do n't get is their own advocate who can sponsor and vote on legislation and perform work in committees. In the case of <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s constituents, they lost their voice in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> last year when <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> agreed to stop voting on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor after being indicted for accepting illegal paid vacations. He later was convicted of that charge in a separate trial. Deputy Clerk <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> said that when a vacancy occurs in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, `` The clerk of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> becomes in effect the supervisor or manager of the vacant offices until a successor is elected.'' The clerk usually selects one of the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> member's senior staffers to run the office, <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s longtime administrative assistant, was appointed to run the office upon the congressman's departure. `` We are carrying on the way that not only <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> would expect of his staff and the years of experience that we have, but also using our own standards of what we believe we should do,'' <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON> said he still talks daily to <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, who has returned to the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, and that the business of the congressional office inevitably comes up. `` I do n't know if there are rules about discussing business,'' <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON> said. `` ... His advice and guidance and counsel, do I still need it for what I do everyday? Absolutely, sure.'' <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> said such communications are to be expected, and voiced confidence that <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON> `` understands his role and what he's doing. <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON> said he has no sense of role reversal during conversations with <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. `` Every time I speak to him ... in a philosophical way, even if it is n't in a literal way, I'm stll speaking to my boss,'' he said. Even the hurdle of sponsoring legislation is not insurmountable without an elected representative. If the appointed administrator believes some problem requires legislation, `` He can talk to the other members of the delegation from that particular state and ask them to support the issue,'' <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> said. `` These are not unusual situations,'' <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> said. `` We have had vacancies for various reasons over the years.'' Ten seats, including one belonging to the delegate from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>, have been vacated since the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began almost two years ago, <PERSON> Colley </PERSON> said. Most of those seats have been filled through special elections. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has called no special election to fill <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s seat, so whoever is elected on Nov. 8 wo n't begin serving until January 1989. Chances are good that <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> will be re-elected to the seat he vacated, but he has said he would not serve. If he wins, it is expected that he would quit again and a special election would be held.

<HEAD>USDA Estimates Show Huge Losses In June, July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The huge losses to 1988 harvests came mostly in June and July, when drought and searing heat shriveled corn and soybean yields across much of the nation, new <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates show. Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the department's chief economist, said total grain production this year is expected to drop to 191 million metric tons, down 31 percent from 1987. Total supplies of grain for 1988-89, which include inventories at the beginning of the season, are forecast at 366 million tons, down 24 percent from last year. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday that `` crop development now has progressed to the point where production can be forecast with a reasonable degree of confidence.'' The corn yield, for example, was estimated at 78.5 bushels per harvested acre, down from 119.4 bushels last year, the largest drought-induced reduction in yield on record, he said. From 1965 to 1987, the September estimate overstated corn production on nine occasions and understated it on 14 occasions, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. In the case of soybeans, the September estimate overshot final production in 12 years and understated it in 11. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said rainfall in the last month `` has improved the conditions of pastures and ranges, although more precipitation is needed to restore them to normal.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he is holding to an earlier prediction that consumer food prices will go up an average of 3 percent to 5 percent this year, with about 1 percent of the rise caused by drought. A further increase is expected in 1989. The new <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates showed the corn harvest, which is under way, is expected to be at a five-year low of 4.46 billion bushels, down 37 percent from 7.06 billion bushels harvested in 1987. Even so, that was down by less than 1 percent from the forecast a month ago. In May and June, before the drought tightened its grip, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> projected the corn harvest at 7.3 billion bushels, based on trends and an assumption of normal weather. Those projections were revised downward in July to 5.2 billion bushels, assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the season. In August, the forecast was lowered to 4.48 billion bushels, the smallest harvest since 1983, when drought and federal acreage curbs reduced output to 4.17 billion bushels. The soybean harvest was estimated at a 12-year low of 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from 1.9 billion bushels produced last year but virtually unchanged from the August forecast. Estimates last spring called for about 1.88 billion bushels, and the July projection was 1.65 billion bushels. Production of all wheat was projected at 1.81 billion bushels, down 14 percent from 2.1 billion produced in 1987 and 1 percent below the August forecast. In May and June, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> forecast this year's wheat output would be up slightly. The July projection was 1.84 billion bushels, and the August forecast was 1.82 billion bushels. Corn is the largest and most important crop grown by American farmers and, as a feed ingredient, is essential to the production of meat, poultry and dairy products. Soybeans, which provide high-protein meal and quality vegetable oil used in food processing, also are vital to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food production. No new estimate of winter wheat production was included. Last month's forecast, which was carried forward into the September report, was 1.55 billion bushels, down 1 percent from last year. New estimates for spring planted wheat included durum, 49.2 million bushels, down 47 percent from 1987 production and the smallest harvest since 1961. The new estimate was also down 10 percent from August. Other spring wheat was estimated at 206 million bushels, down 54 percent from last year and 3 percent below the August forecast. Cotton production was estimated at 14.7 million bales, down 2 percent from August but only slightly below the 1987 crop. The crop was projected at 13.7 million bales in July. Overall, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crop production this year is expected to drop to 88 percent of a 1977 base used as a comparison. That would be the lowest since 1983. Crop production last year averaged 106 percent of the base year. The record was 117 percent reached in 1985, 1982 and 1981.

 A District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police inspector testified that syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> broke a local gun control law when he fired on a backyard intruder in June. Following a pre-trial hearing Monday that included testimony from police Inspector <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said he would rule by Friday on a motion that weapons charges against <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> be dismissed. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 63, has been charged with using an unregistered revolver to wound a teen-ager who was intruding in the backyard of his home. He also has been charged with unlawful possession of ammunition for the handgun. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who has written and spoken frequently on behalf of gun control, maintains that his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, was told by city officials he was not required to register the weapon used in the June 14 shooting. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> testified that he had complained repeatedly to police about trespassers and said that death threats heightened his concern over intruders. The columnist, who contends the police knew he had a gun, said he had warned a police officer that if anyone ever confronted him on his property late at night, he would have to shoot them and he did n't want to do that. The officer, <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chatman </PERSON>, contradicted <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s testimony, saying, `` He never made a statement to me about any action he was going to take.'' <PERSON> Chatman </PERSON> said he'd been to the <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> house between 10 and 20 times in the last few years, all on complaints about trespassers using the pool. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who has worked in the district's gun records division since 1976, said <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> had broken the law that prohibits anyone but the registered owner from using a weapon. He acknowledged that city police officers and federal law enforcement agents are not required to register weapons, but he insisted that only those individuals are allowed to use the weapons. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> added that it is a violation of law for other family members even to touch an agent's weapon. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> does not require agents to register with local authorities weapons used for official duties, according to <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McElhaney </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He declined to say whether a .22 - caliber revolver, the weapon used in the shooting, would normally be approved for use by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a lawyer, testified Monday that he spoke three times with police about whether the weapon should be registered and was told he need n't register it, but never got a written statement on the matter. The senior <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 19, of suburban <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, on the night of June 14 after he caught <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and three other youths taking an unauthorized swim in his pool. If convicted on the misdemeanor weapon and ammunition charges, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> faces a possible maximum penalty of two years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans today released a set of recommendations to encourage full development of Hispanic talent, including a trade policy with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> that benefits businesses on both sides of the border and expanded education initiatives to lower the illiteracy and dropout rates. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> task force on Hispanic affairs said in issuing its recommendations that four advisory committees had examined Hispanic education and literacy, economic development, employment, and health. `` By taking a fresh look at these and additional issues on the threshold of the 1990s, we intend to re-energize and refocus attention on the needs and potential of Hispanic Americans,'' the report said. `` We do not see this potential as different from other Americans. Rather, we want to ensure that Hispanic Americans have access to the opportunities and support systems already available to most Americans for many generations,'' said the committee, led by Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. The task force's recommendations include: _ Expanding national and local initiatives to reduce illiteracy and combat a high Hispanic student dropout rate _ Advocate programs at the federal, state and local levels and in the private sector that provide managerial skills assistance to small minority businesses _ Pursue an aggressive trade policy with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to benefit businesses on both sides of the border _ Improve the recruitment of qualified Hispanics into managerial and professional positions in the private and public sector _ Promote health and disease prevention efforts, with an emphasis on fighting AIDS _ Support better access to bonding and insurance for small firms The committee said it hoped its efforts would boost the nation's appreciation for `` one of our rich cultural treasures _ the American of Hispanic descent. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> is the official caucus of <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators. In addition to <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, other members of the task force are Sens. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pentagon Pursues Development Of Earth-Burrowing Warheads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is pursuing the development of nuclear warheads that would penetrate the earth before detonating and which could be a more effective weapon against Soviet underground command centers. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had authorized development of the so-called `` burrowing nukes'' that have been under study for years. Military scientists are convinced they would be far more powerful against underground bunkers than other nuclear devices that explode on the surface, even if they do n't pack the same explosive power. The new weapon, which is highly classified and the responsibility of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, is formally known as an earth penetrator. The Energy Department disclosed in June 1987 it had begun preliminary development work on the warhead needed for a burrowing missile because it expected the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to request one. According to a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman and other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources, that request now has been formally made. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be expected to step up its work on warhead design while the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pursues missile development and integration work. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodyani </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> last month recommended approval of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> statement on the need for the weapon and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> subsequently approved it. She said the final authorization was dated Aug. 19 `` and approves this program as a new start.'' She would not discuss program details such as funding and anticipated deployment schedules. Another Pentagon official, who insisted on anonymity, said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had directed the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> to provide cost estimates and predicted performance data for a more rudimentary version of the weapon that could be produced by modifying an existing missile or bomb. `` There will almost certainly be an interim earth penetrator,'' this official said. `` But the authorization clears the way for the broad-based research needed to produce a brand new weapon.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration recently has begun spotlighting Soviet construction of underground bunkers, saying it appears the Russians are convinced they can protect their leaders while waging a nuclear war. Earlier this spring, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported in its latest edition of the publication `` Soviet Military Power'' that such construction had been under way for 40 years and the bunkers could `` accommodate thousands of people.'' A burrowing warhead would not have to penetrate more than a few feet before posing an increased threat to a bunker, but `` it's not easy'' to develop a warhead that can withstand the shock of striking and burrowing through the ground, one official said.

 The viewing area from which reporters and spectators have watched 25 space shuttle launches at the Kennedy Space Center will be off-limits to most onlookers when shuttles start flying again because of safety concerns, officials say. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> on Monday announced the new precautions at the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, space facility, citing studies that `` have shown that the danger to persons on the ground is much greater than was understood should an accident occur.'' The restrictions cover the viewing area that overlooks launch complex 39, where space shuttle Discovery is being prepared for space. A press viewing area 3.5 miles from the launch pads has been used by media representatives since the shuttle program began. Invited guests, including astronauts' families, watched from a nearby VIP area, and Kennedy Space Center workers and their families also were able to watch from certain areas. Under the new plans, most nearby areas will be cleared just before and during the launch. Details of the plans were to be explained at a briefing today at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The plan drew protests Monday from Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., who said at the Kennedy Space Center that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, Space and Technology had argued against such a change in a letter sent Friday to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` I do n't think an iron curtain should be placed about the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> when we're getting back into space,'' said <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a member of the committee and chairman of its subcommittee on space science and applications. `` The press has been very much a part of the manned space flight program for 29 years and to arbitrarily say that some of that press has to be excluded is not right,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials said the new rules were developed after studies of the Challenger explosion in January 1986 and the loss of an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Titan 34D the following April. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> range safety officers monitor each launch and have the responsibility of blowing up any rocket that strays out of control. During the Challenger accident, the solid-fueled rocket booster engines broke away and were destroyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> range safety officer. A study of this accident, and of the Titan 34D loss, gave new understanding of the dangers to people near the launch pad, the announcement said. `` Under certain conditions, a solid rocket booster released from the vehicle as a result of an accident would follow an unknown ballistic trajectory rather than begin to tumble on course as had been previously thought,'' the announcement said. Also, the statement said, it was learned that if out-of-control boosters had to be destroyed in flight, `` the boosters fragmented into thousands of pieces and the explosive properties of unburned solid motor propellant were greater than originally determined in laboratory tests.'' `` Because of this new information,'' the statement said, `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> have determined that the prudent action is to minimize the population at the close-in viewing areas.'' Accredited journalists will be able to work in the area `` except for the hours just before the launch and the launch itself,'' the statement said. During the prohibited period, only `` media with an immediate need for the facilities at the press site will be allowed.'' The rest, it said, will view the launch from a site on a causeway. The alternate site will be equipped with a countdown clock, audio commentary and video monitors. About 3,000 members of the media have requested accreditation for the first post-Challenger launch, that of Discovery, which is expected to occur in about two weeks. The exact number that will be permitted at the press site has not been disclosed. The letter to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> from the congressional committee, headed by Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said, in part, `` Although we have no doubt that the new assessments leading to this proposal are well intended, the calculation of such risks is highly uncertain.'' It asked the president to intercede and permit continued access to traditional viewing areas.

 Political jockeying over family issues is taking a new turn in the wake of Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remark that women with newborns should not face loss of their jobs if they take a few weeks off. House Democrats jumped on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comment Monday and urged the vice president to support a family leave bill that both chambers are expected to vote on this month. `` We would welcome your support for and participation in the consideration of the bill so that it may be enacted into law this year,'' five legislators, backed by <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a letter. The Family and Medical Leave Act would require employers of more than 50 to grant unpaid, job-protected leaves to parents of newborn, newly adopted or seriously ill children; seriously ill employees; and workers who must care for sick parents. Democratic nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, a longtime supporter of the measure, reiterated his view in a letter Monday to Rep. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., and Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., two of the bill's chief The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said the bill would `` bring us one step closer to a more humane workplace for all Americans.'' In the letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> and four other <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has opposed the family leave act since its introduction in 1985 by <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` However, the press has reported a willingness on your part to reverse this historically held position and endorse family and medical leave legislation,'' the lawmakers said. Last Friday before a <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> women's group, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> departed from his text and also from the administration's hard-line opposition to government-mandated family leaves. `` Look, we also need to assure that women do n't have to worry about getting their jobs back after having a child or caring for a child during a serious illness,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not elaborate on the remark at the time, but his campaign is developing a more detailed proposal The letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was signed by <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> and Reps. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont.; <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif.; and <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif. <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON> is chairman of a leadership task force on the bill and <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> is chairman of the Education and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in his letter to <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, left no doubt he agrees that job-protected leave should be available to men as well as women and for personal illness as well as a child's medical crisis. `` A father who needs a few weeks to care for his sick son, a worker who has cancer, or a mother who brings home a new baby _ they should not have to sacrifice their jobs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wrote. The House bill, which counts 16 Republicans among its 151 co-sponsors, would require employers to make 10-week leaves available to parents of newborn or newly adopted children. Medical leaves of up to 15 weeks would have to be available. Businesses employing fewer than 50 would be exempt for at least three years. The small business community is fighting the family leave bill on the grounds that it would create hardships for their companies and that the government should n't dictate employee benefits. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, has estimated the bill would cost businesses less than $ 200 million.

 A <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION> man has been charged with murdering his common-law wife although police said they `` do n't even know where to begin looking for the body'' of the woman who disappeared in July <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Tu </PERSON>, 58, was arrested at a <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, hotel on Saturday, a day after <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police charged him with first-degree murder in the suspected death of 42-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tu </PERSON>. Police said scientific and circumstantial evidence led them to conclude that the woman had been slain at the couple's home in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>. `` We do n't even know where to begin looking for the body,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenna </PERSON>, the county's chief of detectives. Police said they interviewed people who spoke of discord in the couple's marriage. Other factors cited by the police were allegations that <PERSON> Tu </PERSON> threw out his wife's favorite love seat shortly after she disappeared, traces of blood found where the love seat had stood in the home and Tu's departure for <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> before he was scheduled to take a polygraph test. Tu, a marketing employee of a real estate development, told friends and relatives in July that his wife had gone to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to help a friend who was ill. Police said the friend reported she had not seen the woman and had not been expecting her <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tu </PERSON>' grown son and daughter from an earlier relationship reported her missing to police on Aug. 10. Tu was questioned by police on Aug. 13 and 14 about his wife's absence and agreed to take a lie detector test, but left the state before doing so. Detectives said Tu was being held at the <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> pending extradition proceedings. The couple had lived together for about 10 years, police said.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> slammed into <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> on Monday with torrential rains and 115 mph winds, ripping the roofs off buildings and spawning flash floods and mudslides. One report said 30 people were killed. <PERSON> Doren </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cayman </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that a lawyer in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> called the radio station and said at least 30 people had died across <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> as the brunt of the storm lashed the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island Monday afternoon. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said his station's correspondent in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> reported that hundreds of families had fled their homes because of rising floodwaters. The hurricane pounded <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> on the southwest coast and <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ocho </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> on the north. In <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, 115,000 people were evacuated from their homes as a precaution in five eastern provinces when <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s winds brushed the island, said <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON>, the government news agency. Authorities in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> said looters stole mattresses from a hospital, the roof was torn off a home for physically handicapped people and a firefighter was hurt when heavy winds blew him off his truck. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said his office was in touch with a meteorological office in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> as the eye of the storm passed over city. On the leading edge of hurricane, winds gusted to 140, he said. `` Then on the trailing edge of the eye wall, there were winds just as strong and they said they could n't see anything outside their windows,'' Sheets said. `` It was quite a frightening experience for them.'' At midnight EDT, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was centered near latitude 18.5 north, longitude 79.5 west, or 135 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION>, the National Hurricane Center reported. `` The hurricane is moving toward the west near 17 mph,'' the center said in a statement. `` This motion will bring the center of the hurricane over or near <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> in the early morning hours Tuesday.'' The <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, south of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, are flat and have few sheltered areas, the center said. In <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s capital with 750,000 people, the initial 30-minute shock of the storm let up as the hurricane's eye moved across the city. Skies brightened, winds died and people waited for an hour before the second blow arrived. Amateur radio operators in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> said they received reports of buildings collapsing and severe power outages across <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Shelby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said he monitored a report from a radio operator staying at the <LOCATION> Wyndham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> seven miles east of <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> `` and the building was shaking badly by his description.'' `` They've been without power in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> since last night for the most part and telephone service has been real, real spotty,'' <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. Another ham radio operator went off the air after reporting storm damage at his house near <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. `` When he got back on the air, he said most of his house had disappeared,'' <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. `` It's been a heart-rending listening to them all day.'' Amateur radio operator <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maragni </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Coconut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said he also received transmissions indicating widespread and heavy damage in <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` They've had the airport with severe damage,'' <PERSON> Maragni </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Monday night. `` They had to evacuate the <LOCATION> Montego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> meteorology center approximately about 8 o'clock this evening -LRB- EDT -RRB-, so I've been unable to get any reports out of there.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebaugh </PERSON>, a National Hurricane Center forecaster, said some hangar roofs blew off at the international airport in <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> and some runway aircraft were damaged. All flights were canceled on the island. Amateur operator <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hialeah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said he has been speaking with other radio operators in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> since Monday morning. <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON> also said he heard a report from <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> saying the top of a city hospital was blown off and the main television station on the island was not broadcasting. `` People were telling me they saw trees and stuff flying around,'' said <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON>. `` But so far I have n't heard of anyone being killed.'' He said reports from the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> indicate widespread blackouts and some damage along coastal areas from high waves. Heaviest damage reports were in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, however. `` The eye of the storm moved right lengthwise down the island,'' Sheets said at 5 p.m. EDT. `` They're getting five to 10 inches of rain -LRB- in <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> -RRB-, and so the mudslides, flash floods and all of that will be continuing for the next six to eight hours.'' Sheets said the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> has a dearth of sheltered areas. `` They're very flat, there's not a lot of places people can go to get refuge,'' he <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said at 9 p.m. EDT that <PERSON> Little </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayman </PERSON> had been evacuated, as well as lower-lying areas of Grand Cayman. `` Everyone is waiting with bated breath,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> in a telephone interview. `` It is calm here at the moment but we are expecting to take the brunt of it.'' <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> airlines was running flights every two hours to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to evacuate as many people as possible before the hurricane hit, said airline spokesman <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Chisolm </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> reached <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> after skirting southern <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Hurricane warnings were issued Monday for the south coast of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> east of <LOCATION> Camaguey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, while warnings were discontinued for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>, a policeman suffered a broken leg when a fence fell on him, another resident was injured when a wall collapsed and a firefighter answering an emergency call was hurt when the wind blew him off the fire truck, the disaster office reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Mona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for paraplegics reported its roof had been blown off. Police reported people were stealing mattresses from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and there was scattered looting in the <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portmore </LOCATION> and <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>. There was an unconfirmed report that prisoners had escaped from <LOCATION> Kingston </LOCATION>'s Gun Prison. <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the office of Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON>, was the crisis center. <PERSON> Seaga </PERSON> said in a radio interview that he would seek international aid. Most of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s 2.3 million people stayed home and boarded up their windows. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON>, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said 40 mph winds from the hurricane prompted authorities to evacuate more than 115,000 people from the eastern provinces of Tunas, <LOCATION> Guantanamo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Holguin </PERSON>. The region is about 90 miles north of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> at its closest point. More than 80,000 head of livestock in that area also were moved to safer ground, the agency said.

 Two clowns who fell in love at a clowns' convention took a shot at tying the knot in a ceremony that was a regular circus `` I take Chubby Cheeks to be my awful wedded husband,'' Sparkles the clown said in the weekend ceremony. `` I promise to love, honor, and bathe him ... And I will not nag at him for eating candy bars, ice cream and cookies.'' The bride clutched fake flowers and sported gold tinsel hair, twinkling gold eyelashes and size 18 shoes. Before the vows, Chubby Cheeks, trembling from matrimonial jitters, tried to make a run for it. `` My mother cooks better than her!'' he shouted as he tried to wobble to freedom in his white baggy pants and oversized shoes. He was headed off and returned to the side of his bride, where he said: `` I take Sparkles to be my lawful-wedded wife, I promise not to eat peanut butter and cookies before going to bed, I will help with the housework, I promise to take out the garbage and hang up my clothes every night, and I promise to visit her relatives without any argument whatsoever.''

The Democratic nominee had just finished railing against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his role in the Iran-Contra affair and promised that a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> admininstration never would sell arms to a terrorist nation.

Instead, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` I do n't question <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s terrorism. He immediately realized his error and, after taking a few seconds to laugh along with his audience, delivered the line from the text.

 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' visit Monday to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> was without a major protest, in stark contrast to an event he held here on Labor Day as part of his fall campaign kickoff. A small group of anti-abortion protesters gathered outside the union hall where <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a speech on national security and a handful also met the Democratic nominee outside a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> television studio. The relative calm came just a week after a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> event in a nearby neighborhood was disrupted by about 100 anti-abortion protesters whose chants drowned out most of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' remarks to residents of a narrow street where he held an outdoor meeting. The advance man who arranged the Labor Day event has since been fired by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign.

 Chicken soup is good for you, according to folklore, but dieticians at <LOCATION> Holyoke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> say it's too salty for a healthy heart and have come up with a broth for the Eighties. Patients at this 250-bed hospital in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> may dine on `` Just What the Doctor Ordered'' low-sodium, low-fat chicken soup. `` A typical 7-ounce portion of dried soup contains 726 milligrams of sodium and the same-sized bowl of canned soup contains 850 milligrams of sodium, while our frozen ` Just What the Doctor Ordered' soup contains 22 milligrams of sodium,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ascolese </PERSON>, food services manager at the hospital, said Monday. The typical restricted diet for a patient with high blood pressure or heart trouble limits sodium intake to 1,000 milligrams a day, he said, so a bowl of commercial soup would just about use up the daily allotment. The chicken noodle soup, as well as a vegetable beef soup, were an outgrowth of the hospital's 2-year-old frozen meal program for recently released patients and the elderly, <PERSON> Ascolese </PERSON> said. The hospital began looking into packaging frozen meals after federal reimbursement regulations were changed in 1984 to shorten average hospital stays, he said.

 At least 14 people were injured Monday when Sinhalese militants attacked a bus in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> during a national general strike called by anti-government Sinhalese, police reported. They said strike enforcers hurled a bomb at the bus, one of the few state-transport vehicles operating, and several of the victims were hospitalized. The driver of another bus was stabbed for defying the strike call and a bus was set afire, according to police. Police and army patrols were deployed throughout the capital. A few shops and banks opened Monday morning but were shuttered by noon. The <ORGANIZATION> Sinhalese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> called the strike to protest the death of lawyer <PERSON> Vijedasa </PERSON> <PERSON> Liyanarachchi </PERSON> while in police custody. <PERSON> Liyanarachchi </PERSON>, 35, died on Sept. 3, nine days after he was arrested in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and accused of being linked to several assassinations.

 Parishioners who once admired their minister of nearly two decades expressed mixed emotions as he went on trial on charges he decapitated a handyman in an attempt to assume a new identity. The Criminal Court trial of the Rev. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> began Monday with jury selection, which is expected to take most of the week. He is charged with first-degree murder and arson, and faces the death penalty. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>'s decapitated body was found in a rolled-up carpet in the burned-out remains of the <ORGANIZATION> Emmanuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pentecostal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oneness </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, 43, preached. `` Two days before this happened we would have given him our last dime,'' said <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 30, who with others in the congregation has been attending weekly services in a borrowed building in nearby <LOCATION> Gallatin </LOCATION>. `` I do n't feel personally betrayed. More let down than anything else.'' `` It's just a lot of mixed feelings about him -LRB- <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> -RRB- right now,'' said <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON>, the victim's ex-wife. `` I hope he can tell the truth so that he will have a chance of getting forgiveness from God.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON> said she and the victim were close to a reconciliation when his body was found June 15, 1987. The congregation, once closely knit, was stunned by the slaying and the church's burning. Some parishioners, though, have stuck by <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>. The congregation numbers about 40. About 20 members have left since the slaying, Mrs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` I think as far as the evidence is concerned I believe he's guilty,'' said <PERSON> Marlane </PERSON> <PERSON> McClanahan </PERSON>, 35, who has not been attending services held by the current pastor, the Rev <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>. `` I'm sad for him -LRB- <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> -RRB-.

Police say <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> tried to fake his own death by putting his belt and other clothing on the headless body, which also was missing part of the right arm and two spots where <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON> had tattoos.

<DATELINE>LAKE WILDWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wind-whipped fire racing through the Gold Rush country of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> foothills Monday destroyed 138 homes and other structures and forced more than 8,000 people to evacuate. Some 4,500 residents of the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> area, where some houses cost $ 1 million, were forced from their homes twice in the past two days as the out-of-control wildfire raged through rugged terrain. Late Monday, hundreds more were ordered from the communities of <LOCATION> Smartville </LOCATION>, Rough and Ready and <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, said state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandino </PERSON>, bringing to 3,500 the number evacuated from that area in two days. Two firefighters were injured and others had to dive for cover as capricious winds drove the fire through timber and dry brush about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, or about 150 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The latest evacuations were ordered after the fire's 70-foot flames jumped a highway and headed southwest, threatening hundreds of scattered rural dwellings. `` There are hundreds here and they are pouring in,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quirk </PERSON>, at the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> evacuation center. `` The school buses are bringing in senior citizens, and there are campers and motor homes in the parking lot.'' By late Monday, the blaze dubbed the 49er Fire had burned an estimated 15,000 acres, or nearly 25 square miles, of western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Flames threatened the high technology <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the county's largest employer with 1,000 workers. Authorities said the fire reached three sides of the company's grounds, and that a storage shed had been burned The <ORGANIZATION> Yuba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> met in emergency session in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION> to declare the zone a local disaster area, and expressed concern that the fire may threaten <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, 20 miles to the west of the fire and the home base of the SR-71 `` Blackbird'' spy plane. The blaze was fueled by drought-dry brush, wood shake roofs and propane tanks which exploded like small bombs in the intense heat, said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakobs </PERSON>. The destroyed structures were valued at $ 9 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Along with 84 homes, 54 outbuildings also were razed, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Westling </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. She said the figure represented only a preliminary estimate of losses and that it could climb higher. Two firefighters were burned when their truck was caught in flames. One suffered leg burns, was wrapped in wet gauze and taken by helicopter to a nearby hospital. The other man was treated at the scene. About 40 men in two fire crews were forced to use their portable fire shelters when wind shifted suddenly and swept the flames over them. Flames engulfed a bulldozer, forcing the operator to wrap himself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge under the vehicle. It was one of 11 fires that destroyed nearly 30,000 acres of timber and brush in five rural <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> counties Monday. Residents of this affluent mountain town of 4,500 people 45 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> and the tiny town of Rough and Ready were evacuated Sunday, and Highway 49 was closed. They were allowed to begin returning home Monday morning, but were ordered evacuated again later. <LOCATION> Smartville </LOCATION>, evacuated later, is about 15 miles west of the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-Grass </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> area, the largest communities in the region. <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwwood </LOCATION> are about six miles west of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A force that had grown to 1,700 firefighters saved the majority of the resort homes, but flames destroyed 13 large resort homes, five boats and a dock. Nineteen other structures outside of the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> area were destroyed, including several residential trailers and agricultural buildings. It skipped through the community, burning yards and oak trees between large houses, some valued at $ 1 million. In some places, flames reached the town lake, igniting marina railings, several boats and a dock. `` I was coming back from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, sitting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and I see my father's house burning on television,'' said insurance agent <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanzone </PERSON>, 41. He said the 3,000-square-foot home was destroyed even though it was separated from the forest by pavement. `` It's amazing, one burns down right in between others that do n't, and this one that burned had a tile roof.'' said <PERSON> Fes </PERSON> <PERSON> Venardi </PERSON>, 67, who lives two house away from one destroyed home. `` I never thought this would happen,'' <PERSON> Sanzone </PERSON> said. `` I did n't think there was enough underbrush, but the wind was blowing so bad. Wind was estimated at 25 to 30 mph Monday throughout most of northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, but higher gusts were reported on the fire lines. `` The wind is our biggest enemy out here today,'' said <PERSON> Jakobs </PERSON>. `` We had a solid front of fire about a half-mile long moving at a rapid rate through dense brush and timber.'' The 49er fire reportedly started along Highway 49 _ named for the 1849 Gold Rush towns it winds among _ about six miles north of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> by a transient burning toilet paper. The fire spread southwest away from the nearest populated areas. But pushed by gusting winds, it quickly skipped in a matter of hours over nearly 10 miles of unpopulated foothills to the posh <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> area. A second <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> fire burned along Highway 49 in an area of brush, light timber and scattered homes midway between Grass Valley and <ORGANIZATION> Auburn </ORGANIZATION>. Most schools were closed in the region. Thick smoke made it unsafe to operate school buses, and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> converted at least three schools into temporary evacuation centers. The <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> residents, some of whom fought alongside fire crews, were first pulled out Sunday. They were allowed to return early today only to be ordered out later, said <PERSON> Jakobs </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> information officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said about 5,000 state, federal and local firefighters were battling nine other timber and brush fires Monday, mostly in remote areas. No homes were destroyed in any of those blazes.

 The new Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> says her title should give her a platform to help young people lost in an increasingly amoral society. `` I'm an ambassador now for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> told a news conference Monday. `` I feel that we are living in an amoral world, that society has truly lost its bearings, its moral values,'' said the 22-year-old from <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>. Crowned early Sunday in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> said she wants to attend <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and become a lawyer. Among the country's problems are the `` divorce rate, drugs, violence, sex issues,'' she said. `` All of these things are manifestations of the breakdown of the family actually.

In addition, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> has found that `` our children today are more narcissistic. They are in love with themselves. We are in an individualistic era.'' One solution would be better education, she said. `` My concern about education is that there is not enough time being spent on curriculum,'' she said. `` I do n't necessarily think it would involve more funds to help this problem.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Find Prehistoric Artifacts In Colonial Barracks

<TEXT>
 Archaelogists sifting through the rubble of a colonial barracks that housed Hessian soldiers defeated by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> in the Revolutionary War have found some surprises: prehistoric artifacts almost 4,000 years old. `` It's really turning out to be a very exciting project,'' project director <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> said Monday. `` It shows there are well-preserved prehistoric remains right underneath <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>.'' The dig by the <ORGANIZATION> Hunter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> archaeological firm began about four weeks ago in this state capital as part of the $ 2.4 million renovation of Old Barracks Museum. The barracks _ a bunkhouse where soldiers lived joined to an officers' house _ was built in 1758. It was used at various times through history to house British and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers, smallpox victims and single women and widows. The original no longer stands, and a reconstruction forms the museum. However, the structure is best known for its significance in the Battle of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> in 1776. In December of that year, Gen. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s war-weary soldiers crossed the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and defeated Hessian troops stationed at the barracks. It marked the first time Hessians _ West German mercenaries who fought for the British _ were defeated by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who went on to win several key victories. The state hired <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON>' firm to determine the original layout of the building, as well as to find the parade grounds where soldiers performed military drills. But in the course of their work, the archaeologists discovered artifacts and sites dating back nearly 4,000 years. For instance, near the southwest section of the building, workers found projectile points _ some resembling arrowheads _ and other artifacts dating back to 2000 B.C., said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Regensburg </PERSON>, a prehistoric specialist working on the project. Historians are excited by the finds, said museum director <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` We've had a lot of prehistoric archaelogists from all over the state coming over to look,'' she said. Near the southeast part of the building, archaeologists discovered part of an Indian hearth from between 500 and 700 A.D. Workers also uncovered a piece of a clay tobacco pipe, carrying a design that dates it to between 1000 and 1500 A.D. The findings suggest the area was a popular settlement used over and over by succeeding generations because it sits on a bluff near the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and between two streams _ the <LOCATION> Assunpink </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> and Petty's Run. `` When people started to think about it, it made perfect sense,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. As for the original renovation project, <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> and his crew have found evidence of support posts for the second-floor balconies, a possible staircase in the front of the building, and ground-level windows which seemed to have been bricked up about 20 years after the structure was built. Workers also found part of the parade grounds, <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> said. A musket ball and boot spur are among a number of artifacts dating back about 240 years found near the building's foundation, he said. `` The archaeological evidence is very well preserved,'' <PERSON> Burrows </PERSON> said. `` There's a lot of information in the ground.''

<HEAD>Port Workers Strike; Students Clash With Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Employees of the port at the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> end of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> stopped most operations in a strike to demand payment of bonuses, and students protesting the delays clashed with police, sources said. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Asprilla </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the strike by most of the port's 800 employees paralyzed cargo and fueling operations Monday and stopped food and water supplies to ships. He said the strike would continue indefinitely. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> operations were not affected. <PERSON> Asprilla </PERSON> said workers were demanding the government pay one-third of annual bonuses. About 20,000 government employees held a demonstration last Thursday to demand payment of similar annual bonuses. The government, financially strapped in part by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, has said it will make the payments soon but does not have sufficient funds now. In a related incident, a group of high school students protesting the late payments clashed with police outside a school Monday, witnesses said. A leader of the parents' association of the school, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said 20 students were struck by police. Police denied the report. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> closed the school indefinitely. Last week, a cash shortage forced the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> to cut the pay of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and other top officials from 12.5 percent to 30 percent. A government communique said the cuts would save about $ 230,000 a month. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s once-thriving economy has been hard-hit by several months of political protests demanding <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions imposed to force the general to leave, and a period when banks were closed or handled only limited operations. Business sources say the economy is about half what it was in early 1987. Earlier this year, the government had trouble meeting its payroll. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who as commander of the Defense Forces is the power behind the civilian government, is charged with drug trafficking in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He denies the charges and accuses the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of trying to undermine the Panamanian government as part of a plan to avoid turning the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> over to the Central American country under treaties signed in 1977.

 Voters settle primary contests in six states today, including a high-stakes <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, bitter legislative battles in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, and Republican clashes in two states where mothers of small children were criticized for seeking office. In <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, Democrat <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s decision to retire after 31 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> enticed four members of his party into the race, including former Gov. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, who lost a re-election bid two years ago. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> appeared to be the front-runner until the entry of <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team owner <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who spent $ 2.1 million, much of it his own money, on TV ads. A poll published by the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday showed <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> preferred by 43 percent of the voters, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> by 40 percent, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON>, an unsuccessful <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate in 1986, by 8 percent, Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION> 5 percent, and 4 percent undecided. The poll had a margin of error of 6 percent. The heavy spending by <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> became a major campaign issue, especially since <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> spent just $ 145.10 in his last race. <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Follette </PERSON>, who reported spending $ 15,536, ran a radio commercial that began with the sound of a toilet flushing, his way of saying that a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> tradition of personal campaigning was going down the drain. A Garvey commercial showed a Frankenstein monster with a television on its shoulders and a Kohl ad on the screen. In the background, film clips from horror movies showed citizens fleeing in terror. The Republican field was smaller but the fighting was just as intense, with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> pitted against former state party chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. King. <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> labeled King an ultraconservative, while he condemned her as a liberal and also questioned whether she could campaign for and hold an office like the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> while also taking care of two small children. In the Journal poll, <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> held a 61 percent to 30 percent lead. Motherhood also became an issue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where former state legislator <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON> and former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> are the front-runners in a six-way GOP race for the nomination to succeed Republican Rep. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. Last week, Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, a Douglas supporter, said <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON> should stay home and care for her toddler daughter. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> apologized for his `` dumb'' remark after it was roundly denounced and deplored by virtually everyone. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> gave up his seat to run for governor after <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> announced he was retiring. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> is heavily favored in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary against <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> mayor, and political unknown <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>. The winner will face <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON>, a staunch opponent of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant who narrowly lost <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> in 1986. In neighboring <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, another longtime <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman is giving up his seat to run for higher office _ <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, who is seeking the nomination to replace retiring Republican Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, as popular with Democrats as with Republicans, is favored in a primary over <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employee. <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> has attacked <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>' independence _ which in 1987 earned him the second-highest anti-Reagan voting record of any <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> as analyzed by <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> Quarterly magazine. Former GOP Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON> donated $ 1,000 to the <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> campaign, but declined to endorse <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON>, saying the 35-year-old political newcomer had not `` sufficiently established his credentials.'' The winner of the race will face Democrat <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. In <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the main focus has been on state legislative races in which a number of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates are ultraconservative backers of ousted Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>. In some cases, they are challenging <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers who voted to impeach or convict <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> for obstructing justice and misusing funds. After his removal, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> predicted `` a revolution at the ballot box.'' But he insists that those who keep talking about the <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> factor are `` trying to divert the attention of the voters'' from the real issue _ record tax and spending increases that were passed after his departure to bail the state out of a deficit. The two other states holding primaries today are <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where voters are expected to nominate Republican Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> for a third term and give Democratic Attorney General <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> `` Skip'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> the right to challenge him, and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, which has just one contested congressional race.

<HEAD>Authorities Censor Only TV Propaganda Allowed Pinochet Opponents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities banned a television broadcast by the opposition because it contained a report on torture of dissidents, political activists said. The banned 15-minute, late-night segment is the only televised political program allowed to opponents of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the sole candidate in a presidential referendum next month that could extend his rule for eight years. Also Monday, six people wounded during street violence Sunday were reported in serious condition with gunshot wounds. All were from <PERSON> Cerro </PERSON> <PERSON> Navia </PERSON>, a northwestern working-class suburb of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, where Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s motorcade was stoned by angry protesters on Sunday's 15th anniversary of the military coup in which he seized power. National police responded by using tear gas and water cannon to disperse demonstrators who hurled stones and set up barricades of burning tires. About 50 people were wounded and 400 arrested, police said. The government-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said the opposition program was rejected Monday night because `` it did not abide by the electoral law,'' which grants the government and opposition 15 minutes each of free time on national television to carry their message to voters in an Oct. 5 presidential referendum. The free nightly broadcasts, from 10:45 p.m. to 11:15 p.m., are the only television advertisements allowed to the opposition. The government has ample access to the television, which it controls. The programs started one week ago. A coalition of 16 parties opposing the re-election of <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said the program was censored because it included an interview with a judge, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, who told about the torture of political dissidents by security agents. `` We reject the attempt by government officials to determine what Chileans can and can not see on television,'' the coalition said in a statement. `` Our struggle in the upcoming referendum includes the promotion of a complete freedom of expresion and rejection of any kind of censorship.'' The government's 15-minute program was broadcast normally Monday night. In addition, the government has maintained for months a series of ads urging voters to support <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> in the referendum. The law prohibits political advertisement on television, but the government claims it is not breaking the law. It says its ads do not constitute `` political propaganda,'' but an information to citizens on its works and achievements. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> that censored the opposition program includes Education Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON> and several other government officials. The council's secretary, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON>, appeared on state television to say that the opposition program was barred because the comments by Judge <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> had not been authorized by the court in which he serves. The opposition called the council's decision `` illegal and unconstitutional.'' <PERSON> Genaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ariagada </PERSON>, secretary general of the opposition coalition, denied the censored program broke the law. `` The only one that has broken the law here is the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Arriagada </PERSON> said. `` This an abuse that every decent Chilean citizen must reject.'' When the time came for the opposition program to be broadcast, a sign appeared on the screen saying it had been suspended because it `` did not abide by the law.'' Within minutes, residents in a number of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> neighborhoods started banging empty pots from inside their homes, a traditional form of protest. In the Oct. 5 referendum, voters will vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the single candidate nominated by the nation's military commanders, including <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> himself as commander of the army. About 7.2 million voters are registered for the Oct. 5 poll. If approved by voters, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will start a new eight-year term next March. If rejected, an open election will be held within a year, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until then. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> toppled the elected government of President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON> and took power Sept. 11, 1973. <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist, died in the takeover.

<HEAD>Britain Says Evidence Of Iraqi Chemical Weapon `Compelling'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government, citing evidence from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, pressed for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> investigation of charges that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used chemical weapons against ethnic Kurds. `` We now consider the weight of evidence of the use of chemical weapons to be compelling,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman who, in accordance with British practice, demanded anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> asked <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary - General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Monday to send a team to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to investigate the allegations that poison gas was used against the Kurds, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in today's editions In a story from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the newspaper cited unidentified diplomatic sources as saying the request from the four allies reflects a growing irritation with the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government for ignoring <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> protests over prior use of chemical weapons during <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s 8-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it toughened its stand Monday partly because of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> evidence of such attacks, which led the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to vote for tough economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The measure still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Last week the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> summoned the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ambassador and expressed `` grave concern'' about the alleged attacks, but at the time British officials maintained there was no firm evidence the charges were true. `` There is now compelling evidence to trigger action,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He said that in terms of a recent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution the next step was an independent investigation by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> before a decision on sanctions. Iraqi Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Mashat </PERSON> has reiterated his government's denials of the charges and told <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> to stop interfering in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. British official sources have acknowledged a reluctance by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western European countries to accuse <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for fear, they said, of upsetting the delicate cease-fire in the 8-year-old war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> maintained Monday it had changed its mind also because of other evidence, including reports from Western journalists in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, where thousands of Iraqi Kurds, many suffering chemical injuries, have fled. In a Kurdish refugee camp near <LOCATION> Silopi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, near the Iraqi border, refugees on Monday showed reporters a 13-year-old boy with severe burns on his face and neck that they said were caused by poison gas attacks. The Kurds claim <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used the chemical weapons as part of a bloody offensive against the Kurds, an ethnic group in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that is seeking autonomy. About 60,000 Kurds recently fled <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, citing poison gas attacks. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sanctions, which a Foreign Ministry official contended were groundless. The official cited a Turkish <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report claiming there was `` no case proving <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used these banned weapons. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> said Friday no evidence of the use of chemical weapons was found while screening sick and injured refugees.

<TEXT>
 A publishing company closed its offices in the belief that millions of the faithful will be called to heaven today in a prelude to the Second Coming. Most religious scholars and ministers doubt it. All such forecasts in the past have been wrong, noted <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON>, professor of New Testament interpretation at Southeastern Theological Seminary in Wake Forest. Nonetheless, a woman who answered the telephone at the World Bible Society in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, Monday said the office was closed to give employees time to be with their families. The company published the book by <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> that contains the prediction, `` 88 Reasons The Rapture Will Be In 1988.'' `` If anyone is left here, they'll be here Wednesday morning,'' said a woman named <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON>, who refused to give her last name. `` The odds of anybody being right are certainly greater than the odds of winning the recent <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> lottery,'' <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said Monday. He noted that such predictions have been made countless times in the past 2,000 years. `` Nobody's been right.'' Some evangelical and Pentecostal interpreters of biblical prophecy believe `` the Rapture'' is a sort of prelude to Christ's Second Coming But <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> said people who believe in the theory support it by plucking various passages from the New Testament. `` People are treating the Bible as sort of a smorgasboard ... and come out with a kind of unified approach that is not justified by any single passage in the Bible,'' he said. `` So what you have is interpretations by people'' who are not biblical scholars. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, a former rocket engineer, predicted the Rapture would come by tonight. He used mathematical calculations and biblical interpretations to predict that it would occur in the 48 hours of this year's Jewish New Year _ 40 years and 120 days after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> became a nation on May 14, 1948. The time of the Rapture _ by noon EDT _ was determined according to the hour of sunset in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said KAAY general manager <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON>, whose <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, radio station has been carrying <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>'s `` Rapture 88 Ministries'' programs since March. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> spent most of Monday in Little Rock trying to spread his message. He fully expects to be taken to heaven today, Ms. <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> will not talk with the secular press `` because God plainly told him not to sensationalize this,'' she said. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, a 56-year-old self-taught Bible student, has predicted on broadcasts carried by more than 90 radio stations nationwide that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> would `` rapture the church'' _ take the faithful to heaven. But several ministers said the exact time of the Second Coming could not be pinpointed. `` How do they know that?'' asked the Rev. M.D. Battle of the Praise Temple Church in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. `` Because <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> said he did n't even know the minute or the hour I do n't believe -LRB- the Rapture -RRB- is coming by Tuesday night. Of course, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> could come at any time.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vestal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olivet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> said: `` I have had calls from all over the state from people asking ` Do you think <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is coming Tuesday?''' He said some of the callers were concerned that `` Jesus really is coming before they have a chance to be married or have a family or see their children grown.''

 Blades of grass and wildflowers are sprouting through much of the blackened earth at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, heralding a dynamic rebirth in the wake of the fires, park researchers say. The vegetation was spotted around <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, which was besieged by flames last month, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Varley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of research In other areas of the park, scorched pine cones from lodgepole pines, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s predominant conifer, are slowly opening to spill their seeds to the earth, he said Monday. However, it is hard to say how quickly the burned areas will rebound from the devastating summer of 1988, <PERSON> Varley </PERSON> said. In the 16 years since <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials adopted a `` let-it-burn'' policy for most naturally caused fires, there have been approximately 140 wildfires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> that seared some 33,000 acres, said the researcher. But those fires did n't fully prepare researchers for this summer's blazes, so predicting how the forests will rebound is not easy, he added `` We have a considerable body of knowledge on the rate at which these things recover,'' said <PERSON> Varley </PERSON>. `` We're pretty confident that they would come back well.'' To help make those projections, a team of scientists and researchers will meet next month to study the aftermath, <PERSON> Varley </PERSON> said. The fires have created a huge laboratory for <PERSON> Varley </PERSON> and his colleagues that will show them <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>'s regenerative capabilities. It also will show tourists the devastation of fires. `` It is not dead,'' stressed <PERSON> Varley </PERSON>. `` There are some tops of things that are certainly killed. But again, on the basis of the 16 years, that experience that we've had with fire and the research thereof, we know that there will be a lot of sprouting. We know that most of the living organisms are underneath the surface of the soil and still are alive and well.'' The grasses and flowers that have reappeared around <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Varley </PERSON>, have done so without rainfall. `` These plants are remarkably resilient to fire,'' he said. `` Most of the species have insurance policies, so to speak, because they've been putting up with fire for thousands of years. Some of the strategies are truly remarkable.'' One example, he said, is the lodgepole pine. Its cones are covered by resins that are melted away by fire, causing `` that cone to open up slowly after the fire passes.'' `` And so in many of these areas, in places that totally look like moonscapes, then these seeds are being broadcasted out over the forest floor right now, and that's the next generation that will be coming up,'' <PERSON> Varley </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The government said today it has agreed with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to open permanent missions, the first diplomatic relations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and a communist nation. The move to normalize relations stopped short of full diplomatic recognition, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials said they expected the two nations to establish diplomatic ties in the near future. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government is hoping the Olympic Games, which begin in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Saturday, will play a major role in helping to open relations with communist nations. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwang-soo </PERSON> went on national television to announce the two governments had agreed to open missions in their capitals of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to oversee trade, scientific and cultural relations and consular affairs. The two governments agreed to start negotiations on establishing full diplomatic relations, a ministry statement said. `` Both governments expressed their determination to bring their negotiations to a success as soon as possible,'' it said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has no relations with communist nations because of its bitter rivalry with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The North has opposed any ties between communist nations and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, who took office in February, has worked to establish relations with communist nations to try to reduce tension with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and to boost trade. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> wants to establish relations with the North's main allies, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, to reduce their support for any <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> threat to the South. `` The exchange of missions is very significant in that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has secured a bridgehead for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s advance into the East European bloc,'' said a senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and most other communist nations ignored a North Korean call to boycott the Olympics. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government hopes the participation of communist nations in the Olympics will play a major role in developing relations. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> said it will boycott the Olympics because its demand to be a co-host of the Games was turned down by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the grounds that they are awarded to a single city. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the South in 1950 and sparked the bloody, three-year Korean War. The two sides technically remain at war since no peace treaty was signed and the <PERSON> North </PERSON> has staged a series of attacks on the South over the years. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> agreed last year to establish trade offices in the first such move between <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and a communist nation. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government is anxious to develop trade with communist nations to open new markets and reduce its dependence on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as its main export market.

<HEAD>NRC: Management Ready to Operate Nuclear Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Managers at <LOCATION> Pilgrim </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, shut down since 1986 under a government order, can handle a restart under careful supervision, federal regulators concluded. A Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspection at Pilgrim recently concluded `` with high confidence'' that <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> management controls, programs and personnel are ready to support safe startup and operation of the plant, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> official said Monday. The commission ordered the closing because of technical and management problems. An inspection conducted Aug. 8-24 found no `` fundamental flaws'' that would inhibit reactor or public safety during plant operation, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director of the reactor projects division. Inspectors reached their conclusions after carefully monitoring managers' performance and qualifications, said <PERSON> Collin </PERSON>. He said the problem of how to decide if managers could do a good job of running a nuclear power plant by judging their performance at an idled facility was partly solved by using a simulator. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> is still evaluating whether the plant should be allowed to restart. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> noted that intense supervision would be necessary under actual operating conditions. `` We intend to stay very close to that station during any proposed restart program,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> has proposed a four-month supervisory plan for the restart process, said utility spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` It's a very careful, well-considered approach to the restart process. There will be very intensive <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> oversight, but it also provides for additional senior management oversight,'' she said. The inspection consisted of interviews with licensee personnel, plant tours, observations of plant activities, and selective examinations of procedures, records and documents. Inspectors also observed plant activities on all shifts. Most of the senior management is new since 1986, but many department heads remained in place, Ms. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The previous management was often unstable, fixing a problem in one area but then neglecting to maintain the improvement, <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` The team they have now appears to be committed to the station and they have a pretty good track record in the industry,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said.

 A recount was set for Wednesday in the Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary after election officials discovered they miscounted the returns, giving the wrong man the victory. Unofficial results Monday showed Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo the winner by a slim 88-vote margin over civic activist <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> for the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in November's election. Nearly 48 hours earlier, <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> was declared the victor in Saturday's primary. But on Monday the unofficial statewide tally showed Woo the winner with 20,221 votes to Beard's 20,133. At Beard's request, the New Castle County Board of Elections voted unanimously for a recount. The second tally was scheduled to begin Wednesday morning, and both candidates expressed anger over the delay. The delay was due to the need to collect voting machines from around the state, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, deputy administrative director for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, one of three counties in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. Woo's win came after <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> lost 2,800 votes when a computer keypunch error was discovered. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Woo </PERSON> became angry late Monday night when one of his staffers discovered the doors to the Department of Elections for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were wide open. Woo was at the election department's office and could not be reached for comment. But his wife, <PERSON> Katy </PERSON>, said they believed the keys to voting machines were kept in the office. Attorney General <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberly </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he was contacted by Woo about the unlocked doors and ordered <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION> police to guard the door overnight. Election officials learned early Monday that a computer keypunch operator's error had recorded 2,800 votes too many for Beard, according to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, administrative director of the county elections department. The discrepancy came in a district in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where there are about 280 registered Democrats.

<HEAD>Lawyer Disciplined for Wearing Tennis Shoes in Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A public defender faces a weeklong jail term for wearing green tennis shoes in court. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Malanga </PERSON> last month not to wear his green tennis shoes in court. But <PERSON> Malanga </PERSON> showed up in the shoes the next day. `` If you're a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Celtics </ORGANIZATION>, it's OK,'' he told <PERSON> Malanga </PERSON>. `` But this is Superior Court.'' The judge sentenced the lawyer Monday, saying the shoes detracted from the court's dignity. He further prohibited the attorney from seeing other lawyers during his jail term. <PERSON> Malanga </PERSON>, wearing brown leather shoes, asked <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> Monday to drop the matter, saying the issue was moot because neither he nor anyone else is wearing sneakers any more. He apologized, but <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> was unmoved, even when <PERSON> Malanga </PERSON> told him that he was supposed to go to trial today, representing a defendant in a first-degree murder case. `` The attitude of a lawyer to the court must be one of respect,'' <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> said. When a lawyer comes to court wearing green sneakers after he is told not to, `` it's no longer funny. It's contempt,'' <PERSON> Scholl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Malanga </PERSON> said he probably would try to get the state <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to stay the sentence, then added: `` Maybe I'll just let him put me in jail if he thinks that's appropriate.''

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The kidnapping of a 6-year-old girl ended with the suspect lying in the bottom of ditch and the victim's aunt standing over him with a cocked .38 - caliber pistol, authorities The aunt rescued the young victim and captured the assailant Monday when she went looking for them, and, by chance, found them on Lookout Mountain south of Golden near <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bill </LOCATION>'s grave, police said. `` I was n't going to shoot him or anything,'' <PERSON> Marla </PERSON>, identified only by her first name, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which described the incident in today's editions. `` I was scared as he was. `` When I saw -LRB- my niece -RRB- <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON>, I did n't say anything,'' she said. `` I just pulled the gun out and I cocked it and told him to get out.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 26, was being held without bail in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Jail for investigation of first-degree kidnapping, first-degree sexual assault and sexual assault to a child. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who police say is on parole for sexually assaulting a 2-year-old, was being held at gunpoint by the victim's 27-year-old aunt when police arrived and took him into custody. Some last names were not contained in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s story because the newspaper has a policy of not naming sexual assault victims. Police said the little girl was playing on the sidewalk in north <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> with a 5-year-old cousin just before 1 p.m. Monday when a man grabbed her, dragged her into a van and sped away. The girl's mother and a different aunt chased the van on foot for a couple of blocks, then called police <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> said her two sisters came to her house about 1:30 p.m. to tell her the girl had been kidnapped. `` I said, ` We'll go look for her,''' the slightly built woman recalled. `` I had just got out of the shower, and I went and got my gun and I got my bullets.'' Because of the ruckus that had been raised at the scene, <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> figured the kidnapper would be heading out of town. `` I told her -LRB- the mother -RRB- we'd go to this one place, so we drove up to Lookout Mountain.'' While the girl's mother was calling her own mother in <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, from a pay telephone atop the mountain, <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> and the other aunt saw a van matching the description of the kidnapper's vehicle. <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> jumped back in her car to follow it while the other aunt stayed to tell the mother what was happening. Soon the van pulled over and the driver waved her by, she said. `` But, I got out of the car and had the gun in my pocket. And I walked up to the car and I saw -LRB- the girl -RRB- there, and that's when I pulled the gun out and I told him to get out of the car and told him to get in front of the van and lie down. `` He lay down in the ditch in front of the van.'' She then told her niece to get out of the van and into her car and lock the doors. She told passers-by to call the police. `` I just held him there until the police came. When the police came I just walked over to the car and hugged -LRB- the girl -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Marla </PERSON> recalled that when police arrived, she had to tell them she did n't know how to uncock the pistol. The officer had her put the gun on the ground.

<HEAD>Cisneros Will Forego Run For Fifth Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Saying the time has come for him to move on, Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> vowed not to seek a fifth term, but declined to rule out the possibility of running for a higher office in the future. The 41-year-old mayor's fourth 2-year term will expire next spring, and <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said he will go into private life. Along with handing over the gavel to the nation's ninth-largest city, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> also will pass along some major civic projects he once said were the reasons he was n't interested in seeking higher office. When his term ends, the popular mayor and one of the country's leading Hispanic politicians will have served his native city for 14 years `` It's been work, and it's been fun. Mostly, it's been the most engrossing and fulfilling thing I've ever done,'' <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said at a news conference Monday. `` Basically, I've been at it for 14 years _ eight years as mayor and six as council member. That's a long time to go at full throttle,'' he said. `` Our country believes that eight years in a high office should be enough to get a job done. Presidents serve eight years. Governors serve eight years. And eight years is a good round number for a mayor, especially this one,'' he said. The charismatic, bilingual mayor has served on several international commissions, was interviewed by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> as a potential vice presidential running mate in 1984 and was frequently mentioned as a possible Cabinet-level appointee. Last year, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said he would not be running for statewide office because he wanted to devote time to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> projects and to his son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, who was born with a congenital heart defect and stomach abnormalities. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> declined an offer to make a keynote address to the Democratic National Convention. The former president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> said he wanted to devote time to the city projects, which include a controversial $ 160 million domed stadium proposal and a regional water plan. <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> was approached this year by several <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> businessmen about the prospect of forming a business to handle business investments. He said he has since received numerous job offers, but declined to elaborate. The mayor's salary is less than $ 5,000. With two daughters nearing college age and an ill infant, <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> supplemented that income by writing columns and giving lectures. However, he had to cut back on outside activities because of the health of his son and the time-consuming city projects. `` Today is a little sad for me. It has to be,'' <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON> said Monday. `` But I expect to wake up tomorrow morning, ready to make the most of the next eight months, same pace, same energy, same devotion to the city until midnight of the day before the next mayor takes office.''

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The craziest new gadgets may get the most attention at the second annual Invention Convention this weekend, but organizers hope the show dispells the notion that inventors are wacky. `` We're trying to stress high tech this year,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Suzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallery </PERSON> said Monday. `` It seems everybody pictures inventors as some kind of long-haired weirdos. And we're trying to change that.'' `` We've got some high-tech stuff that will blow your mind,'' Ms. <PERSON> Mallery </PERSON> said. A magnetic car that travels 200 mph, a flying boat, an automatic squeeze-handle screw driver and a sound-emitting chair that is supposed to provide the equivalent of eight hours of sleep in 20 minutes are among the 300 inventions that will be on exhibit. Another thing organizers hope to change with the displays are the relatively small number of Americans marketing their creations, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Gnass </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> marketing consultant who runs the convention. `` We think the convention is rekindling <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s creative spirit,'' <PERSON> Gnass </PERSON> said. `` Inventors are the underpinning of our economic future. Politics have never really done anything revolutionary for people. It's been technology that's always put us ahead, advanced civilization.'' Half of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patents issued last year went to foreigners, <PERSON> Gnass </PERSON> said. Some 20,000 people are expected to attend the four-day affair at the <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Mallery </PERSON> said. The convention starts with seminars and panels Thursday and exhibitions are open to the public Saturady and Sunday. Also on tap are more than 50 seminars for would-be inventors. Panel speakers will include <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakamats </PERSON>, inventor of the computer floppy disc, and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who dreamed up the Barbie Doll.

<HEAD>Report Criticizes Soldiers Who Killed Hijacked Passengers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soldiers who stormed a hijacked plane in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> in March shot a passenger in the back and did n't take precautions to prevent injuring innocent people, a government newspaper reported. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>'s article Monday represented a rare public criticism of the country's security forces, and raised new questions about the bungled attempt to end the March 8 hijacking. `` Our forces are not prepared to act in extreme situations,'' said an article published Monday in the state-run daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. A family of 11 Siberian jazz musicians known as the Ovechkins hijacked a Tu-154 plane carrying 76 people on a flight from the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. They demanded that the <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> Soviet jetliner fly to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Ground controllers tricked the family into thinking the plane was landing in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, but it actually touched down at an airfield near <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. A special anti-terrorist squad of soldiers stormed the plane after the Ovechkins set off a homemade bomb, starting a fire, Soviet press reports said. The soldiers killed a stewardess and three passengers in the amubush, during which four of the Ovechkins committed suicide after killing their mother at her request, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. In the disorderly evacuation of passengers, some were forced to jump onto the tarmac and 35 people were injured, news reports said. The Izvestia article, quoting witnesses who testifieed at the trial of two members of the <PERSON> Ovechkin </PERSON> family that began last week, called into question the assault squad's actions. `` I fell onto the ground, crouched, my hands were twisted behind me, I was placed with my face to the concrete and shot in the back,'' said a passenger identified only as <PERSON> Maizel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> student. He implied that the soldiers mistook him for one of the hijackers. `` Then they ... moved me forward several meters -LRB- yards -RRB- and put my face down and made me lie with my arms behind my head,'' <PERSON> Maizel </PERSON> added. He said the soldiers beat him on his legs and tried to hit his face and head, but he shielded himself. The prosecutor's office is investigating this incident and other actions of the rescue squad. Two of the surviving Ovechkins, 28-year-old <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> and her 17-year-old brother, <PERSON> Igor </PERSON>, went on trial Sept. 6 in <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION>. They are charged with `` seizing an airliner with a view to flying abroad with use of arms that resulted in the death of people and other grave consequences,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It said <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Ovechkin </PERSON> testified that she tried to prevent her brothers from hijacking the plane.

 <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON> loaded her station wagon with family pictures and memorabilia and her husband, <PERSON> Bud </PERSON>, sprayed water on the dry grass around their home while a mountain blaze flickered just up the hillside. `` We stayed last night, and I want to stay, but a fire is one of the worst of my fears,'' she said late Monday night. At least 15 homes have been lost in the affluent residential area and the fire continued to burn on the edge of the community, about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, on Monday evening. The out-of-control mountain blaze has forced the evacuation of at least 8,000 people. At least 142 structures, including nearly 100 homes, were destroyed, according to officials who early today estimated the blaze had burned more than 20,000 acres. Around the <PERSON> Boyers </PERSON>' home, separated by a 30-foot street and just one row of homes from the closest burning trees, about a third of the homes were still occupied by residents who said they would n't leave until the last moment But <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, 48, said one sleepless night was all he and his 46-year-old wife could take. `` We stayed last night, but we did n't sleep at all, did n't even try. We stayed with the house all day,'' he said. `` It seems the fire came up, backed down and now it's back up again, only closer.'' For <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, 64, and his wife, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, 63, the fire that brushed through this <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> foothill community was a stunning shock, but not a new experience. `` I'm going to think positively. We went through it before and we will again,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> said, recalling being evacuated from a 1971 fire that came near their home in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Chatsworth </LOCATION>. The Derricks moved into their new retirement home here just a month ago. `` I ca n't believe it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON> said. `` I do n't even have the drapes up yet The paint is n't even dry. This is just terrible.'' For some residents, the fire made a quick entrance into their community. `` All of a sudden it was here,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bridges </PERSON>, 30. `` It swept right past us, even burned the brush under the deck, but the house did n't catch. I ca n't image all the things we would have lost,'' he said. Bridges and a friend, <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldrom </PERSON>, 28, said after the fire brushed past Bridges' home Sunday night they joined about six other residents to help three professional firefighters. `` I could n't believe those guys,'' <PERSON> Waldrom </PERSON> said. `` They told us exactly what to do and we saved maybe a half dozen homes, and they told us, ` Watch out. It's coming.''' `` It was half a mile away, and two minutes later it was 100 yards away, and we got behind a building and it blew right by us. I've never seen anything like it.'' `` It was terrible,'' Bridges added, `` but it was probably the most satisfying weekend of my life. We saved some homes, and I even saved my brand new truck.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> began a tour of one of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s most prosperous and democratic countries today as the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> announced a fifth papal visit to the continent next year. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was not included. `` <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> is an island of peace with itself and its neighbors,'' the pope told an airport crowd of several thousand, among them a choir of barebreasted schoolgirls. `` In fact, it can be rightly called an island of peace in a troubled sea.' The diamond-rich nation maintains a Western-style, multiparty democracy in a region of one-party black-ruled states. Besides conflict over racial segregation in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is torn by guerrilla warfare and civil strife. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> has largely avoided involvement in these conflicts but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has made several raids against what it claims are guerrilla centers of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which is fighting to overthrow <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> has denied that it harbors guerrillas. Before the pope flew from <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> for the second stop on his five-nation African tour, <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> had accepted invitations to visit <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>. There has been speculation that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also would visit <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and possibly <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on that trip, expected next May. <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> said neither country was `` on the program,'' although he confirmed that Angolan bishops had recently addressed an invitation to the pope. On his current visit, the pope has coupled condemnation of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policies with pleas for dialogue with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to solve regional problems. According to <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> plays an active role in regional peacemaking efforts, and sent <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> Cardinal <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Etchegarray </PERSON>, a top aide, to the region three times in the past year. <PERSON> Etchegarray </PERSON> met with officials of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> in May and presented them with a letter from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. The pope concludes his tour with a visit to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> on Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, said they would declare a unilateral cease-fire around the Mozambican cities the pope will visit _ <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beira </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nampula </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> stopped short of claiming a mediation role for the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` The role of the Holy See in affairs of the region is not and does n't want to be a mediation role in the diplomatic sense of the word,'' <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON> told reporters. `` It wants to create a climate in which dialogue can be possible.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was scheduled to meet <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Quett </PERSON> <PERSON> Masire </PERSON> and give a Mass at the national stadium in <LOCATION> Gaborone </LOCATION> during a visit of less than 24 hours. The expected crowd of 50,000 at the stadium would be larger than the number of Roman Catholic church members in the country, about 45,000. The pontiff was scheduled to leave Wednesday morning for the mountain kingdom of <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, where thousands of pilgrims from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> were expected to attend ceremonies. During a three-day visit to <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, the pope appealed for reconciliation and human rights, and for an end to racial and tribal discrimination. He celebrated two masses, held a rally of more than 30,000 young people, talked with diplomats and met <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops and other Christian leaders from the region.

<TEXT>
 Christian militiamen kidnapped Defense Minister <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line today, but freed him after the army threatened to move against them, police said. Osseiran, a Shiite Moslem, was released in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> this afternoon and was on his way to the western Moslem sector of the capital, a police spokesman said. The spokesman can not be named under standing regulation. The warning by army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a Christian, came an hour after gunmen of the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, seized Osseiran, 83, near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line and took him to their seaside headquarters, police reported The Lebanese Forces command denied it was holding Osseiran. It said in a statement that the militia's security apparatus has been `` put on alert with orders to search every corner of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for Osseiran.'' But the police spokesman said the militia command had initially offered to swap Osseiran for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> parliament member <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON>, who it said had been kidnapped in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Thursday. The Lebanese Forces are the Christians' main militia. The police spokesman said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has long been at odds with the Lebanese Forces over their growing dominance of a `` state within the state'' in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Christian heartland north of the capital that has eroded the authority of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s divided government. `` The general simply can not tolerate the abduction of his own chief, the defense minister, in an area that is supposed to be under direct army control,'' the spokesman said. The Lebanese Forces have claimed that <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped by pro-Syrian militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at a checkpoint south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> last Thursday as he was driving to <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>. The Christians claimed he was was being kept at the <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` against his will.'' The <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> acknowledged that <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON> has been staying there `` incommunicado'' since Thursday. Osseiran's kidnapping heightened tension between Christians and Moslems amid a political deadlock in efforts to elect a new president. The political wrangling has raised fears it could rekindle <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war. Police said <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON>'s kidnappers made the demand for <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON>'s return in a telephone call to the office of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> The spokesman said the Christian militiamen stopped <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON>'s black limousine at a Lebanese Forces checkpoint on the east side of the Green Line `` Two militiamen entered the car and drove with the defense minister to the Lebanese Forces headquarters,'' the spokesman added. <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON> was kidnapped a few hundred yards from a sit-in by <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON>'s supporters to demand his return. `` Return Deputy Serhal!'' the protesters chanted as the sit-in blocked traffic across the nearby Museum Crossing, which links the two sections of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON> was among Christian legislators who boycotted a parliamentary session called Aug. 18 to elect a new president because they opposed the candidacy of <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, a former president who is backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. The session foundered because not enough legislators turned up to form the required quorum. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>, president from 1970 to 1976, was the only serious candidate. <PERSON> Franjieh </PERSON>'s followers accused the Lebanese Forces of forecefully preventing deputies from showing up at the session. <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, was kidnapped in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on June 17, 1987 with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalist <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON> and their driver. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON> and the driver were freed that June 24, and Glass escaped Aug. 17, 1987.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> officials have asked Olympic advertisers to allow silent live coverage of certain events to continue during commercials in a corner of the television screen, according to a report published today. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> executive producer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> confirmed that the plan had been presented to certain advertisers and said some have indicated interest, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported. Under the plan, unprecedented in Olympic coverage, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> would superimpose a silent picture in the lower-righthand corner of the television screen during commercials in sports such as basketball, volleyball, cycling and long-distance track events. The sport would occupy one-quarter of the television screen. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is hoping to avoid the harsh viewer criticism <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was subjected to during this year's Winter Olympics, when goals were scored during commercial breaks of hockey telecasts. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has experimented with the technique during telecasts of major-league baseball games. `` Some of these athletes have worked a lifetime to get to the Olympics,'' said <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON>, speaking from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, where the Olympics begin later this week. `` It would be a shame if a great performance was n't seen by the home folks because we were in a commercial break.'' Advertisers are paying <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> up to $ 330,000 for a 30-second commercial. <PERSON> Weisman </PERSON> said advertisers should consider the `` good-will'' value of consenting to the proposal. `` Viewers will appreciate the gesture and so will the athletes,'' he said.

 A 17-year-old mother accused of putting her newborn baby inside a brown paper bag and dumping her on the sidewalk says she wants her daughter back.

Two Jewish officials subsequently were demoted. `` When all of the facts are looked at I think its a bum rap,'' said <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s chief domestic policy adviser. <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> said the phrase `` Jewish cabal'' written in the margin of a memorandum was `` straight, vintage <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>.'' `` This thing, ` Jewish cabal' and all of that, is kind of pure <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> venting spleen,'' <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> said. `` Most people on the staff really did n't pay any attention to that. They did n't do anything about it. And those things kind of blew over as kind of rhetorical excess.'' <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON> said it was `` extremely unfair'' to <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, who `` is the farthest thing from a bigot of anybody I know.'' `` If you recognize it for what it is, which is a fellow back 17 years ago doing something the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> instructed him to do and he had no discretion in doing, I think it ought to just go away,'' he said. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> said in a statement Sunday that he resigned to keep the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign focused on the issues. He admitted compiling data for former White House chief of staff H.R. <PERSON> Haldeman </PERSON>, but denied he had a role in any demotions. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strongly defended <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> and denied that he was prejudiced.

 A federal judge refused to lift the suspension of a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> professor, saying academic freedom was no excuse to make a racial remark. `` If academic freedom or tenure gives one the right to use expressions in public that are patently offensive to a particular group ... then quite possibly the boundaries of proper conduct should be redrawn,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Duross </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> also said in Monday's rejection of a suit by <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> that issuing an injunction in favor of the professor could inflame racial feelings at the college. <PERSON> Towery </PERSON>, a tenured associate professor of English, was suspended with pay in March after calling freshman <PERSON> Ginevra </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> a `` black bitch.'' He admitted making the remark, but said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> had provoked him when the two argued over her request to withdraw from his class with a passing grade. <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> said Monday evening of <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>'s ruling, `` Who could be happy with this? There's not really anything else I can say.'' Miss <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said she was relieved. `` I thought he might be able to return, even though he had been suspended.'' She said she still believes <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> should have been fired. After a hearing in June, a faculty committee recommended that <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> be allowed to teach again during fall quarter. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Southwestern President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitan </PERSON> overruled the committee last month and suspended <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> without pay for the quarter. <PERSON> Towery </PERSON>, 50, then filed a lawsuit charging his suspension without pay was a violation of due process and that his career, reputation and finances have suffered. The suit asked $ 250,000 in damages. <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> argued in a hearing his constitutional right of due process had been violated when <PERSON> Capitan </PERSON> overruled the committee. <PERSON> Capitan </PERSON> said he based his decision in part on evidence not presented to the committee. <PERSON> Capitan </PERSON> testified that his work to relieve racial tensions on campus would be difficult if the professor returned to the classroom this month. In his ruling, the judge said that <PERSON> Towery </PERSON> `` showed a lack of discipline when he used a particularly egregious expression in the presence of a young black woman, whatever the provocation.''

There were no casualties, he said. The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview, identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer. He did not give the ship's origin or destination. The nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking in high winds. They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the sinking, the official said. A Dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the scene. Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.

<HEAD>Government Urges All Residents Test for Dangerous Radon Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The problem of residential radon contamination appears to be more widespread than previously believed and serious enough to warrant testing for the deadly gas in every home nationwide, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today. New surveys show particularly high levels of the invisible, odorless gas in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The average home in those states contains radon above the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s guidelines, according to figures released Monday at a joint news conference of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> Discussing the findings on the <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the agency had believed radon was a major problem for several years, but `` what this information shows us is that it is a problem in many states, more states than we had thought. In addition, the estimates -LRB- of concentrations -RRB- are a little higher than we had thought.'' EPA has estimated radon-caused lung cancers could be killing 20,000 people out of the nation's annual toll of 130,000 lung cancer deaths. And though <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has n't changed its estimate that 10 percent of some 80 million homes have radon above the guidelines, the new surveys in seven states and on Indian lands in two more showed more than 29 percent of all homes above the guidelines. Combined with the results of 10 states surveyed last year, that means one home in four of the 12 million in the two surveys was above the agency's guideline of 4 picocuries per liter, said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Guimond </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s radiation office. `` We think we've documented the problem enough to recommend that every home be tested,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> told the news conference. `` Even if we are off by -LRB- a factor of 10 -RRB-, the problem is severe enough so that we ought to do something about it,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Houk </PERSON>, assistant surgeon general attending the news conference to announce a formal public health advisory calling for radon testing. <PERSON> Houk </PERSON> said the health toll from radon `` probably exceeds by 10 times outdoor air pollution,'' and physicians should learn about it to advise their patients. Radon is a radioactive gas produced in the decay of uranium found in all soil and rock in at least trace amounts, and present in the outdoor atmosphere normally at a concentration about 0.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 4 picocurie `` action level.'' Homes tend to concentrate radon indoors. Radon kills by leaving its own radioactive decay products in the lung, irradiating the tissues for a lifetime. Smoking, itself the major cause of lung cancer, increases the effectiveness of radon by 15 times, <PERSON> Houk </PERSON> said. `` If you have any detectable radon in your home, do n't permit smoking indoors,'' <PERSON> Houk </PERSON> said. `` We have not characterized 4 picocuries as safe,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> noted, and the agency is studying the adoption of using outdoor background levels as a goal for indoor programs. At 4 picocuries, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes a lifetime resident increases his or her chance of lung cancer by about 1 percent, a risk level larger than any the agency tolerates in its other programs. This extra risk is about equivalent to smoking half a pack of cigarettes per day, <PERSON> Guimond </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has certified that about 1,000 companies are qualified to test for radon, and the test can be done for as little as $ 10, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. The first thing someone confronted with an abnormal result should do is get it confirmed, `` not unlike a lot of other things when you go to see your physician,'' <PERSON> Houk </PERSON> said. If action is needed, a majority of homes probably can be fixed for less than $ 1,000, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. What can be done depends on the house. Some homes might require a simple sealing of cracks in basement walls. Others might require complicated systems to draw air from beneath basement slabs and discharge it outdoors. Still others might be cured by better ventilation stepping up the exchange of indoor and outdoor air. <PERSON> Houk </PERSON> noted that most mortgage lenders require homes to be checked for termites, and said, `` It is time to certify that our homes are free from radon'' when sold. In <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, the survey identified `` an area similar in severity to the Reading Prong,'' a well-known narrow area of high-uranium soils extending from about Reading, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, across northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Below is a list of the states surveyed. After each state is the percentage of homes above 4 picocuries per liter, and then the average concentration in that state. Surveys were designed to be statistically sound, and the agency said there was a 95 percent chance the true percentages would be within 3 percentage points of the percentages given. <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, 7 percent, 1.6 picocuries per liter; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 26 percent, 3.6; <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, 24 percent, 3.4; <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, 46 percent, 4.8; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 18 percent, 2.6; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 37 percent, 6.2; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, 63 percent, 7.0; Indian reservations in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 20 percent, 2.9. States surveyed last year were <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The son of the founder of the <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. hamburger chain was ordered to repay $ 10,500 as part of a federal insider-trading suit against him and more than a dozen other relatives and company officers. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> was ordered to give up the amount he avoided in losses by acting on inside information to sell debt securities in <ORGANIZATION> Carl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON>, who ordered the payment Monday, also issued a permanent injunction barring <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> from future insider trades. However, the judge declined to impose triple damages requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which had filed the civil suit in April after trading irregularities were uncovered in random computer checks. The case continues against the other defendants, including <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>'s Jr. founder <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON>, who is president and chief operating officer of <ORGANIZATION> Karcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON>, who appears in folksy commercials for the hamburger chain with 450 outlets in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, is a prominent social benefactor in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> contends that the brothers told relatives in advance of an unfavorable earnings report on the chain in October 1984. The relatives are accused of using that information to sell securities, avoiding losses totaling $ 300,000. If they are found guilty and triple damages are applied against them they could face more than $ 1 million in penalties. The brothers are n't accused of making trades themselves. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> maintained he did n't know he had broken any laws by selling <PERSON> Karcher </PERSON> debentures in October 1984.

<HEAD>70-Year-Old Law Used in AIDS Sex Assault Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors are using a 70-year-old state law dealing with the spread of venereal disease against an AIDS carrier being retried for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman. <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 38, is charged with knowingly causing a woman to be in danger of getting a venereal disease, prosecutors said. Prosecutors believe it is the first time a defendant in the state who is a carrier of acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been tried under the 1919 law. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> is also charged with oral sodomy, with attempted rape and with robbery after an earlier felony conviction. Jurors were deadlocked in <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s first trial in May on the three felony counts. Prosecutors said the added the venereal disease charge to the other charges against <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> after the first trial, after researching state laws. He is accused of attacking his half brother's girlfriend Feb. 11 in his apartment. He contends the woman made up the accusations after he rejected her sexual advances. The woman has had an AIDS test, and it was negative, prosecutor <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said Monday that his AIDS test was positive but he has n't developed symptoms of the disease. AIDS carriers can test positive for AIDS antibodies without becoming sick for years, but they still can transmit the disease to others. AIDS, which is most often transmitted through sexual contact, is an affliction in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving the victim susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials are still uncertain about what caused Flight 225 to skid off a runway and its nose gear to collapse, the second such accident in recent months involving a DC-10's landing gear. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said there were 197 passengers and 10 crew members on board the flight, which originated in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and made stops in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. No one was seriously injured. The nose gear broke when the plane went off the runway during landing at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 1:50 p.m. In May, the nose gear on an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 collapsed when it ran off the end of a runway at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Six people were injured in that accident, which prompted a special <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> investigation of all DC-10 landing gear braking systems. That investigation is incomplete. In Monday's accident, a pilot said he lost control of the steering on the 13-year-old plane just as it landed, said Lt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to speculate on the cause. Many passengers were shaken after the rough landing _ one passenger suffered a minor ankle injury during the evacuation _ but they praised the actions of the crew. `` People were really flipping out, but the -LRB- flight attendants -RRB- were incredibly under control,'' said passenger <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampe </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> The Rev. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Loebl </PERSON>, a Jesuit priest from <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, said the plane landed `` on a wing and a prayer.'' `` I was afraid, but all God needs is a good simple act of trust and he can do the rest,'' he said. `` And there were a lot of people besides me praying.'' `` When we got on the bus to take us back to the terminal, we all cheered,'' <PERSON> Loebl </PERSON> said. `` Once for the crew, because they were great, and once just because we made it.'' Passenger <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandt </PERSON> said she knows what caused the accident. `` The plane got sick,'' said the 3-year-old, who had bumps and scrapes like many of the other passengers.

<HEAD>Reagan Signing Anti-Discrimination Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House is turning on some election-year, Rose Garden charm to celebrate President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s signing of a bill that strengthens the government's power to combat housing discrimination Some 100 congressional leaders, Cabinet officers and other administration officials were scheduled to gather today at the White House to witness the presidential signing ceremony. The effort is seen as a boon to the White House aspirations of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose staff was described as helping forge a compromise on the measure. But members of both parties, however, had rushed to become co-sponsors of the measure after the president signaled his willingness to sign it into law. The original fair housing law, passed in 1968 after the assassination of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, gave the federal government only a mediation role in settling housing disputes. Under the new law, the secretary of housing and urban development is empowered to go to court to seek stiff fines against property owners accused of discrimination. The bill received final congressional approval in early August, before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left on his traditional three-week summer vacation. However, the legislation's transfer to the White House was delayed so that a signing ceremony could be held after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week. The measure gives the federal government its first significant powers to combate housing discrimination. The handicapped and families with children under 18 would be protected for the first time from housing discrimination. The current law covered discrimination against racial minorities and legislation signed into law in 1974 barred discrimination on the basis of sex. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., a chief sponsor, hailed the new legislation as giving the government `` a tough remedy'' against housing discrimination Specter credited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff with being `` very active'' in negotiating compromise language that helped bring the bill to the floor. Other primary sponsors of the bill included Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., and Rep. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> Fish, <LOCATION> R-N </LOCATION> Opponents of the measure, such as Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, R-Idaho., had criticized the measure as `` unfair housing bill,'' contending it intruded on property rights and increased costs due to accessibility requirements for the handicapped and disabled Other major provisions of the bill include: _ The secretary of housing and urban development would try to win a conciliation agreement after a complaint is filed If that effort fails, the secretary or any party could take the case to an independent administrative law judge in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> or to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. _ If the administrative judge finds that someone has engaged or is about to engage in a discriminatory practice, he shall order appropriate relief, which may include actual damages, an injunction or civil penalties _ The maximum fines would be $ 10,000 for a first violation, $ 25,000 for a second violation in a five-year period and $ 50,000 for two or more violations within a seven-year period _ New buildings with four or more units must be constructed to they are readily accessible to the handicapped Doors must be wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs; switches and outlets must be in accessible locations; bathroom walls must be reinforced to allow later installation of grab bars. This would apply to dwellings set for occupancy 30 months after the law's enactment. _ Children could be barred from housing intended for the elderly Such housing is defined as a community where at least 80 percent of the dwellings are occupied by at least one person age 55 or older, and significant facilities and services are provided; or those occupied solely by people age 62 and older.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Gets Second Day Of Complaints From Siberians</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For the second day in a row, Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> faced complaints today from Siberians angry about housing, food shortages and medical care. After <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told workers at a synthetic fiber factory that the ruling Politburo he heads was asked to turn special attention to a shortage of kindergartens, a voice rang out: `` We have kindergartens. We do n't have housing, and the medical facilities are bad,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted one worker as shouting to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Khimvolokno </LOCATION> plant in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. On Monday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> heard similar complaints when he stopped in a tiny village, <LOCATION> Yemelyanovo </LOCATION>, on his way to <LOCATION> Kransoyarsk </LOCATION> from the airport to which he had flown from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We have no hot water. You do what you can to wash,'' one man shouted at the 57-year-old Communist Party chief. Usually, Soviet citizens politely praise <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his policies or ask mild questions when he stops for chats as he tours the vast country. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came back from a six-week vacation to a street-side discussion in <LOCATION> Yemelyanovo </LOCATION> and at the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> factory filled with complaints about food and living conditions. The evening television news program Vremya led its Monday evening program with a report of about 20 minutes on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s trip to the city about 2,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> It included the acrimonious exchange in <LOCATION> Yemeleyanovo </LOCATION>. As a crowd pressed closer and closer to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, shouting complaints and questions, the general secretary cut in: `` OK, comrades, I got caught your drift.'' The Soviet leader blamed local and national officials for failing to develop social services in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>, and reiterated that he is committed to providing each Soviet family with a separate apartment by the year 2000. But some in the crowd were not satisfied. `` There will never be that,'' said one man, apparently referring to the planned individual housing. Another man doubted the discussion would be covered by the officially controlled media. `` <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON>, will everything be shown on television or will half be cut out?'' `` All of it will be shown,'' the Soviet leader responded. One of the most vocal of the crowd members, a blond-haired man in his 20s, began the complaints by shouting about poor management of a local grain storage facility. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> asked for support for his reform policies as residents complained about long lines for meat, sausage and other foods, as well as a lack of hot water. `` The most important thing is that you believe in our politics and in the leadership that is still being formed. It's still being formed at the regional and provincial levels,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He told the group that he was not interested in blind faith, but in reasoned trust for his policies and the people implementing them. `` We're on the right path, comrades,'' he said. `` No need to get lost. We're on the right path.'' Today, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stopped at <LOCATION> Khimvolokno </LOCATION>, which <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said was a factory key to improving the supply and quality of consumer goods. The plant is now under reconstruction because it, as well as associated facilities, are old. `` Social development has chronically lagged: housing, schools and hospitals. Now we must together restore that which we lost during those long years,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would stay in the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> region, which occupies one-tenth of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, until the end of the week. <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> also is the site of a Soviet radar station that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says is an obstacle to arms control negotiations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not discuss the radar site in comments distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and shown on Soviet television. He had been out of public view since July 30, when he met with the West German foreign minister. Soviet officials said he had been on vacation.

<HEAD>Flight Engineer Says Hamadi Was Joyful Over Stethem's Blood</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The flight engineer of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet hijacked in 1985 testified today that <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> `` joyfully pointed'' to the blood of a murdered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage and indicated his death was a great victory for the hijackers' cause. Flight engineer <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said the hijackers beat him and passengers after the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> flight was seized June 14, 1985. He said he was kicked and pistol-whipped. `` I would be hit on the side of the head with the gun butt. When I would bend forward the blows would go down my back,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> testified. The Arab hijackers forced the jetliner to fly to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and held 39 Americans hostage for 17 days. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot and killed during the ordeal. During the hijacking, the jet first flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, and then back to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial on charges of air piracy and murder. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> proudly pointed to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s blood on the jet's fuselage as he and <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> walked around the plane when it landed in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` When we went around the front, the nose of the airplane, Mr. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> joyfully pointed to the blood running down the door. And with the pistol he pointed _ he indicated _ he was very proud of this gun and of him having caused this,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> testified. `` He seemed to be demonstrating that he was capable of being a worthy soldier of the cause for some revolution,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> did not describe the cause. However, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> testified earlier in the trial his cause was `` the fight against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its allies,'' including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The hijackers had demanded the release of Shiite Moslems held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. After the hijacking, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> freed 700 Lebanese, mostly Moslems, from prison camps in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Under questioning from chief judge <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said he was `` absolutely'' certain about the events that occurred outside the plane. The judge indicated <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> denied the incident took place. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said the flight crew tried to keep the plane in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> for as long as possible. He said that as part of a stalling action, he and <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> left the plane to inspect the engines. `` Unfortunately, I could n't find anything wrong with airplane, at least nothing noticeable to Mr. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said he was stunned by <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s behavior as they observed the blood. `` I wondered how he expected me to respond to him. It was as if he wanted congratulations. It seemed to be a great moment to him, what that blood represented to him,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said. He also described the events that led up to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s shooting. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said that when negotiations for fuel with the tower in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> went too slowly, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> shouted `` Get up! Get up!'' to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. The flight engineer said both hijackers then left the cockpit. `` I heard a pop. I heard someone exhale very loudly. I heard it above the engine noises. The shock of that noise was added to by the co-pilot on the radio stating that we needed fuel because they were killing passengers,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> testified. The <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> pilot, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>, testified Monday that he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> because the defendant seemed to enjoy violence. The pilot said he did not see <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> pull the trigger and said both hijackers may have been with <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> when the American was killed. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has admitted being one of the hijackers, but has denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Also today, <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> expressed relief that a West German businessman was released Monday after 20 months of captivity in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I am extremely relieved that Mr. -LRB- <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> has been released,'' the judge said. `` This happy news means an end to endless speculation about what influence <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' captivity would have on these proceedings.'' <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said `` outside elements'' had never influenced the court, adding: `` It is not the job of the court to conduct diplomacy.'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another West German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 in the week after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with explosives in his luggage. <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, was convicted by a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court of helping kidnap <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> in a bid to free his brother. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released Sept. 7, 1987 in what his kidnappers said was a `` good will gesture.'' In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' pro-Iranian captors said his release was linked to <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. In a statement, the captors said that if <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s release can not be gained legally, `` then we shall be obliged to again resort to violence.''

In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> joined the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> call, asking the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to send a team to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to look into allegations that gas was used against the Kurds, most of whom live in northern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, the second-ranking diplomat at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, met Monday with Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to make the request, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> said today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> acted on behalf of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said the spokeswoman, who requested anonymity. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is extremely concerned about chemical warfare'' and backed a recent unanimous resolution by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> condemning its use. `` We now have a case before us in the use of chemical warfare by the Iraqis against the Kurds and I believe that we will have to.. ask the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- secretary-general to investigate this as he investigated the previous allegations'' against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is determined that the use of chemical warfare will not become an accepted part of regional conflicts. It is a danger in its own way as great as nuclear warfare and we intend to stop the proliferation of chemical warfare.'' The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it toughened its stand Monday partly because of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> evidence of such attacks, which led the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to vote for tough economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The measure still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has denied the charges. British official sources have acknowledged a reluctance by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and other Western European countries to accuse <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for fear, they said, of upsetting the delicate cease-fire in the 8-year-old war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The British <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> maintained Monday it had altered its stance also because of other evidence, including reports from Western journalists in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, where thousands of Iraqi Kurds, many suffering chemical injuries, have fled. The Kurds claim <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used the chemical weapons as part of a bloody offensive against the Kurds, who are seeking autonomy from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. About 60,000 Kurds recently fled <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, citing poison gas attacks. In <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said charges that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used chemical weapons were `` fallacious'' and marked unwarranted interference in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. In a statement issued at its headquarters, the organization denounced what it called `` an Israeli-American media campaign'' against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, meanwhile, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sanctions, which a Foreign Ministry official contended were groundless. The official cited a Turkish <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> report claiming there was `` no case proving <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used these banned weapons.'' <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> said Friday no evidence of the use of chemical weapons was found while screening sick and injured refugees. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> is touring <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to discuss issues to come up at the 43rd session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to convene in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sept. 20. He is leaving on Wednesday for <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> on the first visit ever by a member of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Cabinet to that landlocked Soviet-bloc country. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said he would meet the foreign minister and other senior officials during his one-day visit to <PERSON> Ulan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bator </PERSON>, the capital of <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> established diplomatic relations in January 1987.

 The U.N.-mediated peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> will move to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next week in what could be a prelude to the withdrawal of forces from the war zone, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said today. The minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> asked the two delegations to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sept. 22 during a 20-minute face-to-face meeting today between the two enemies. `` We accepted,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. `` We hope that in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> we could finalize the timetable which starts with the withdrawal of the forces to the internationally recognized borders.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, the first to emerge after the formal session, declined to speak to reporters.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are running neck and neck in a pair of newly released national polls. A CNN-USA Today survey of 1,260 certain voters, released Monday, found 48 percent preferred <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> compared with 46 percent who favored <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But the margin of error of 3 percentage points negates the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lead. A second poll, conducted Sept. 8-10 by the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the lead, 49 percent to 43 percent. Once again, the 5 percent margin of error meant the lead could fall either way. The Roper poll, done for <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and released Monday night, surveyed 619 likely voters nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> CNN-USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> poll, conducted last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, also suggested that the gender gap has narrowed considerably with women opting for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by a 47-45 margin. Fifty-one percent of men polled preferred <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, however, compared with 45 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice of <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for his vice presidential nominee hurt him among swing voters and independents, according to the poll, but left Republicans unswayed as a whole. Another group receiving considerable attention this year, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats, gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a slight edge over <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 50-43 percent. But negative voting seemed to favor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 34 percent of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporters voting against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 20 percent of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> backers saying they were in effect voting against <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The poll concluded that swing voters will have a substantial impact on the outcome of the presidential election. It hinted at soft support among voters on both sides, with one in six backing either candidate saying the other could do something to change their minds. A full fifth of those questioned said they were n't very committed to either candidate or had not decided who to vote for.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today promised a new era of individual `` economic empowerment'' and urged voters to reject Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' vision of `` an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> shackled to the mistakes of the past.'' The vice president criticized `` prophets of pessimism'' who he accused of ignoring the fruits of eight years of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s economic policies _ lower interest rates and inflation and creation of nearly 18 million jobs since 1982 `` Americans at every income level are certifiably better off than they were in 1981,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the Executives' Club of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` So the next time somebody tells you that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is declining, tell'em to put away the 1980 calendar. This is 1988. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a rising nation again.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee offered a `` flexible freeze'' on government spending without any tax increases and _ borrowing a phrase from former Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> _ `` economic empowerment'' for the individual rather than government controls. `` The strength of our economy comes from the people, not from the government, from the creativity and initiative of the individual, not from official directives, five-year plans and so-called industrial policies,'' he said. `` Let's remember that today, when the prophets of pessimism are again heard in the land. The jobs, say the pessimists, they're not good enough. The trends, say the pessimists, they're worrisome. The international competition, say the pessimists, it's too tough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of espousing a big government philosophy that will lead to a growing bureaucracy, less competitive industry `` and an <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> shackled to the mistakes of the past.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` is on a magical mystery tour,'' promising to create a fund to rebuild <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with a helping hand from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But the vice president said this helping hand is reaching right for the voters' wallets. `` What will pay for that helping hand? Your money. And who is being helped? Not you,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` This is n't a helping hand,'' he said. `` This is the same old heavy hand of government.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set the tone for today's speech during appearances SMonday at a Hispanic-owned food plant in <LOCATION> Secaucus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and a rally at an <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, shopping center. Touring the <ORGANIZATION> Goya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> plant, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told 100 employees that Hispanic workers `` have been some of the biggest winners in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s economic comeback,'' with their jobs increasing at three times the rate of the entire <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labor force. At the shopping center, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked the Democratic presidential nominee for suggesting that the vice president was emulating the late <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the inquisitorial anti-communist senator who questioned the patriotism of many Americans in the 1950s. At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested that he was a friend of the people and implied that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was n't. `` He suggested that when I said he's a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, that that was McCarthyism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a crowd of about 7,000 supporters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> actually used the term in reference to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attack on him for refusing to require teachers to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> referred to an Aug. 17 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> article that quoted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> saying he was a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>. `` He said that, not me,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said heatedly. `` I am for the people. He's that. He says he's that. `` I am the vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a partner in an administration that has turned this economy around, that has put <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> back to work, that has strengthened our national security and that has enhanced the peace.'' Earlier Monday, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign announced the resignations of five members of his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, an ethnic outreach panel made up of volunteer advisers. A newspaper, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jewish Week, reported last week that a handful of the group's 88 members had ties to anti-Semitic, Nazi or other fascist organizations, or were blocking the prosecution of suspected Nazi war criminals. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION> that the campaign conducted a review of allegations made in the newspaper and `` we were unable to substantiate any of them.'' ` Nonetheless,'' he said, `` these individuals have done the right thing by removing themselves from the controversy and any further use by political opponents.'' He said the five had left voluntarily, and added with visible annoyance that the campaign: `` We're getting into a very peculiar deal where some people are accusing people. I do n't like it a bit.'' Those who resigned were <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Florian </PERSON> <PERSON> Galdau </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilinsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bohdon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedorak </PERSON>. The resignations follow the departure last week of coalition member <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON>, who had been an active supprter of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker who was extradited and convicted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> of being a Nazi war criminal. On Sunday, <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> resigned as the Bush-appointed deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after acknowledging a newspaper report that while serving in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration, he tallied the number of Jews in a federal agency.

 Police uncovered an arsenal of bombs, plastic explosives, grenades and other arms in an uninhabited house in a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, a spokesman said today. `` This was one of the most deadly arsenals of weapons and bomb-making material ever found in the city,'' said the police spokesman, who refused to be identified. `` We are concerned about the possible consequences of such an arsenal of death being stored in a densely populated area.'' <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> is the province's second largest city. He declined to say if police know who owned the cache. No arrests were made during the search. The police spokesman said the arms cache was discovered less than a mile from the apartment where an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bomb killed two civilians on Aug. 31. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to oust the British from <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

A <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bunker was found in a routine search of land near the town of <LOCATION> Dundalk </LOCATION>, about a half mile from the border with <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. He said 18 two-pound packs of nitro-benzine and fertilizer mix were found in the bunker, which was buried under six inches of earth and sealed by steel doors.

<HEAD>Postal Employees Return To Work After Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Postal employees began returning to work today after nearly two weeks of strikes, but officials said it would take as many weeks to deliver a backlog of 150 million letters and packages. The strike ended Monday night after the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> reached an agreement with post office officials. The two sides said they established a framework for further talks on differences over pay bonuses, overtime compensation and the hiring of temporary staff. The union, which represents the 140,000 post office employees involved in the dispute, said it hoped all workers would be back at work by Thursday. About 1,700 workers returned to post offices by mid-morning today while more than 98,000 other strikers continued negotiations, <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said. She said workers are on their jobs at <LOCATION> Tonbridge </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sevenoaks </LOCATION>, both southeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, and in other small offices around the country. Public mailboxes that were sealed during the dispute will be opened gradually, she said. Post office officials said international mail and first-class letters and parcels will receive priority as the backlog of mail is cleared over the next two weeks. About half of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s 1,500 post offices were closed during the strike, and only one of the 82 major mail sorting centers _ in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> _ remained open during the strike. <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> said the agreement condones the `` use of temporary staff, reasonable levels of overtime -LRB- pay -RRB- ... and some diversions of mail to offices which can best handle it.'' The post office wants to pay bonuses to new workers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where the cost of living is high and recruiting employees is difficult. The union, which demanded that the bonuses be paid to all employees or not at all, called a series of strikes that began with a 24-hour work stoppage Aug. 31.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should encourage better Soviet relations but still deal firmly with any Soviet deception or aggression. Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, emphasizing economic themes, said Americans are better off than when President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of U.S.-Soviet relations, `` We in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should stand ready to respond to progress with progress. But we must be ready to meet stubbornness with determination, deception with the truth and aggression with the full power of a strong and united democratic alliance.'' His comments, continuing a week-long emphasis on foreign and military policy, came one day after he pledged support for the Stealth bomber, which he said was begun during a Democratic administration and would be completed during his own. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, renewing his attack on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as too liberal for the presidency, said today in a speech to the Executives' Club in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that the Democrat supports a big-government philosophy that will leave `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> shackled to the mistakes of the past.'' In his remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> embraced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> principles of less government but also praised the idea of `` economic empowerment,'' a phrase often used by <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a Democrat generally considered more liberal than <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in addition to his stands against new taxes and in favor of a `` flexible freeze'' on government spending, `` the third principle is economic empowerment. The strength of our economy comes from the people, not from the government, from the creativity and initiative of the individual, not from official directives, five-year plans and so-called industrial policies.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations today, said, `` Yes, it would be naive to take -LRB- Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at his word, but it would be dangerous to allow his words to go unanswered and untested in the court of public opinion around the world.'' He praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for the progress his administration has made on nuclear arms control but said too often the arms-reduction proposals came from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. And he questioned whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his running mate, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, had the judgment and experience to negotiate with the Soviets. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> a long time but if he could n't stand up to the ayatollah or say no to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, how will he measure up to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked. Meanwhile, five members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> resigned Monday amid charges of ties to anti-Semitic organizations. They said in a statement they were leaving `` because we have been attacked unfairly by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s political opponents.'' The resignations come on the heels of <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s decision to leave his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> post after a published report said he had compiled a list in 1971 of Jews at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had appointed <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> job. The two presidential candidates were deadlocked in the latest public opinion poll. A Cable News Network-USA Today survey of 1,260 certain voters, conducted last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Gordon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, found 48 percent favored the Republican ticket while 46 percent preferred the Democratic slate. The margin of error of 3 percentage points makes the race a virtual dead heat. A second poll, conducted Sept. 8-10 by the <ORGANIZATION> Roper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> the lead, 49 percent to 43 percent. Once again, the 5 percent margin of error in either direction meant the lead was uncertain. The Roper poll, done for <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and released Monday night, surveyed 619 likely voters nationwide. Stepping up his offensive on Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issued an unusual promise to support the Stealth bomber _ a pledge that appeared to go beyond the candidate's previous statements that he supported continued research on the project. `` That bomber was started by a Democratic administration; it was supported by the Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and it's going to be completed under my administration,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told workers at a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor encountered boos and chants of `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' from the employees at the plant where engines for the radar-evading aircraft are manufactured. Those booing were in the minority and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech was not interrupted. At a shopping center rally in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> repeated his charge that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is a liberal Democrat and `` card-carrying member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> _ terms the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee used to describe himself, according to the vice president. `` Recently, the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> accused me of McCarthyism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And it was suggested that when I said he is a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> that that was McCarthyism; when I say he's a liberal that's ... unfair.'' Shouting until he was nearly hoarse, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself who said in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, `` I'm a very strong Democrat, a liberal Democrat ... a progressive Democrat ... a card-carrying member of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>.'' At the rally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not directly respond to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' criticism that Republicans were attacking his patriotism, using the tactics of the late-Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> Earlier in the day, however, in a taped interview with the `` <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION>'' television program, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked what question would he pose to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and responded: `` Do you think the vice president's impugned your patriotism Were you serious when you suggested to this man who's been in public life for 30 years he is guilty of McCarthyism?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, answering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a separate interview, said, `` Oh sure he has. ... You do n't run around suggesting to people that a rival for the presidency of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is less committed to the Pledge of Allegiance and what it means without impugning his patriotism.''

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today he would welcome an expanded Soviet role in world trade if the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> makes long-awaited progress in guaranteeing human rights, ending regional conflicts and halting weapons shipments to terrorist nations.

And he sure ai n't <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. Can we stake our future on the hope that he is a match for <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations that the next president `` must understand the obstacles that exist to an improved relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but he must not be put off by them.'' He added: `` We must act, not react, if we are to regain and maintain the initiative in world affairs. Yes, it would be naive to take <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at his word, but it would be dangerous to allow his words to go unanswered and untested in the court of public opinion around the world.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Soviet actions have fallen short of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s words in reforming Soviet society He called on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to reduce the Soviet advantage in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and promised a Democratic administration's cooperation in negotiating further cutbacks in nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> urged the Soviets not only to help end conflicts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but to support trade unions and alternative political parties in Eastern bloc nations. `` We must constantly remind the Soviets of the regional conflict they created in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a conflict that has resulted in totalitarian rule over six proud nations for more than 40 years,'' he said. While <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has publicly promised to help curb terrorism, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor assailed the Soviets for supplying military and economic aid to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, and providing nuclear missiles to other countries. `` As president, I will work with our allies to persuade Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that if he wants to join the international economic community he must first get out of the business of exporting these weapons to volatile regions of the world,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He also accused <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of failing to deliver on his promise to improve human rights in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` It is not enough to pretend that rights exist when they do not exist,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` We, in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, should stand ready to respond to progress with progress,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But we must be ready to meet stubborness with determination, deception with the truth and aggression with the full power of a strong and united democratic alliance.'' It was <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' first major policy speech on Soviet-American affairs, and was part of a three-day campaign effort to counter <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s charges that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was weak on defense and naive on foreign policy. He began the counteroffensive Monday with an overview of his views on national security in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and later by touring a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> plant outside <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. He reiterated his support for the Stealth bomber, whose engines are made at the plant, but nonetheless was periodically interrupted by booing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters. `` It was a good audience,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> event, during which he did not acknowledge his detractors. `` It was fun. That's democracy.'' From <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> to visit a plant where the M-1 tank was designed. The Democratic nominee supports the tank program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment in light of the resignation of five <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign officials amid published reports of their past ties with pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic organizations. `` I think it raises continuing questions about Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, whose own polls show uneasiness among critical swing voters with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, also criticized the Republican senator in his <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> speech. He called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a failed leader in the war on drugs and derided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to appoint <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his point man in the drug fight. `` We're going to put someone who is tough and aggressive and experienced in charge of the war against drugs,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said after praising his running mate, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke at a gathering of about 250 people in a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> union hall.

 Thirty percent of high-achieving teen-agers said they have considered committing suicide and 45 percent said they knew someone who had killed themself or had tried to, a new survey found. The 19th annual survey of high achievers, conducted by polling teen-agers listed in the directory `` Who's <ORGANIZATION> Who </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Among </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>,'' found that 4 percent said they had tried to commit suicide. Since the survey began tracking attitudes toward suicide among high achievers four years ago, the percentage who reported knowing a teen-ager who had attempted or committed suicide has grown from 40 percent to 45 percent. The percentage who reported having personally considered suicide has been relatively stable, rising from 28 percent to 30 percent over the four-year period, while the percentage who report trying to commit suicide went from 3 percent to 4 percent, the organization said. `` The problem may be especially serious among black high achievers,'' the organization said in a news release. The survey found that 10 percent of the black high-achievers polled this year said they had attempted suicide. The survey results were based on responses from 2,024 students, 5 percent of whom were black, the Who's Who organization said. On other issues, the new Who's Who survey found that drug use continues dropping among the nation's brightest high school students, with less than 1 percent reporting they smoke marijuana more than once a month. That's down from 4 percent five years ago and 11 percent a decade ago. Alcohol use also is decreasing, with 63 percent of the teen-agers surveyed saying they never drink alcohol, compared to 50 percent in 1978 and 48 percent in 1983. The news release did not contain a margin of error for the survey, and Who's Who officials cautioned that it was not designed to be representative of all teens. `` It's important to note these statistics represent high achievers, not the general teen population,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Krouse </PERSON>, publisher of the directory of high school students. He noted that the findings on suicide were lower than those found in the recent survey by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Physical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, Recreation and Dance, which polled a general teen-age sample.

 Opposition leaders today rejected elections that would be organized by the country's one-party government and repeated their call for an interim government to supervise the vote. About 75 students and others, including two <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, went on a 48-hour fast for democracy, reviving a tactic used decades ago in the struggle for greater freedom from British colonial rule. Tens of thousands of people marched in the capital demanding the interim government. They included striking government employees, uniformed students and about 3,000 uniformed doctors, nurses and staff members of militry and other hospitals. The demonstrations were smaller than those the day before. After weeks of political turmoil, many people in this city of 3.5 million have begun eating rice porridge or gruel instead of pure rice because prices have skyrocketed due to growing shortages. Strikes by transportation workers and a lack of fuel have restricted supplies from the countryside, and there has been hoarding by worried residents. A 4.4-pound bag of rice that cost the equivalent of $ 1.70 a month ago now costs $ 5.80. Gasoline was selling at $ 16 a gallon on the black market, compared to $ 1 a year ago, a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said. Opposition leaders <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and former Defense Minister Tin Oo said in their meeting with the government-appointed election commission that they will not support or take part in the elections and will continue pressing for an interim government. The <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which came to power in a 1962 military coup, announced Saturday it will end 26 years of one-party rule and hold elections as early as the end of October. They told the commission that polling could not be conducted in the country's rapidly deteriorating security situation, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said later. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said he told election commission chairman <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Htay </PERSON>, a retired financial commissioner under a pre-1962 civilian government: `` After 26 years of this rule, most people in the country do not know you and will not have confidence. More so, people do not trust any government-appointed commission.'' Like the other four elderly commission members, <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Htay </PERSON> is regarded as politically neutral. The three opposition leaders were later joined by a fourth anti-government figure, former Prime Minister Nu, in a meeting with student rebel leaders. The students asked them to immediately form an interim government, but were told that was not possible without cooperation from the current government. On Monday, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, and Tin Oo signed their first joint statement, a letter to President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> demanding the interim government. Photographs of them eating together and signing the statement received prominent display in private and government-run newspapers Tuesday, buoying the opposition movement. This morning, the group of hunger strikers sat on the road in front of City Hall, where several anti-government demonstrators were shot dead by security forces Aug. 8. They began fasting at 9 a.m., looked after by doctors and other sympathizers. Gen. <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, defense minister and armed forces chief of staff, called for citizens and the military to cooperate in holding the proposed government-organized general elections. The last multi-party elections in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> were held Feb. 6, 1960, when former Prime Minister Nu's <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Fascist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> won a landslide victory over an army-backed party. Gen. Ne Win led the March 1962 coup that toppled Nu, who uses only one name. The military crushed dissent and pursued rigid policies that made <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, once one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s richest countries, one of the world's poorest nations. In September 1987, students stages riots against the government's economic policies, followed by widespread protests in March and in June. After Ne Win resigned July 23, the party chose hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> to succeed him. After only 17 days in office, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was succeded on Aug. 19 by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the first civilian leader since Nu.

 A 1,500-year-old tomb uncovered on the northern coast of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> has yielded one of the richest collections of crafted gold and artifacts ever found in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> announced today. The tomb, officials said, was the burial place for a warrior-priest of the Moche people, a civilization that dominated the Peruvian area from 100 A.D. to about the end of the 7th century. `` This is the richest tomb ever excavated archaeologically in the western hemisphere,'' according to <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnan </PERSON>, an expert on ancient <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bruning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archaeological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lambayeque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, said that the area near the village of <LOCATION> Sipan </LOCATION> may be the burial site for a succession of high-ranking Moche leaders and that other tombs with more treasure may be found. `` I am sure that when we finish digging here, we will know more about the life, social and economic organization, the metallurgical knowledge and religious practices of the Moche,'' <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> was quoted as saying in an announcement released by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Officials said the Moche peoples dominated the Peruvian area prior to the time of the Inca civilization. The <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION> were the most powerful group in the area at the time of the Spanish conquest in the 1530s. The Moche tomb was discovered after authorities learned in January 1987, that a number of remarkably fine gold and silver artifacts were being sold on the black market in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Police raided the home of a tomb robber and, after a shoot out that killed one person, recovered some of the treasures. Information gathered from the raid led to the <LOCATION> Sipan </LOCATION> area and the tomb was found after careful excavation. Among the treasures found were a crown, mask, knives and jewelry of gold, along with more than 1,000 ceramic and copper artifacts. In addition to the warrior-priest, the tomb also contained the remains of two women and three other men, all apparently part of a ceremonial entombment ritual. Excavation of the tomb was financed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> under the auspices of the Peruvian government.

 Oil futures prices, which are trading near two-year lows, could stabilize at higher levels amid speculation that <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> might take the lead in curbing <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production, traders say. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> this morning, prices for near-term contracts of crude oil opened slightly higher than Monday's closing prices. Crude futures prices had skidded below $ 14 a barrel Monday but then surged higher in the final hour of trading after Saudi King Fahd called for joint cooperation between <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC producers in establishing production limits. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the October contract for delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, was trading between $ 14.50 and $ 14.58 a 42-gallon barrel in early trading today, compared with Monday's $ 14.49 closing price. Before the late rally Monday, the contract had dropped to $ 13.75, the lowest level since oil traded for $ 13.73 on Oct. 29, 1986. Contracts for refined oil products also were trading higher this morning. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery ranged between 42.90 cents and 43.50 cents a gallon, compared with Monday's closing of 42.62 cents. The October wholesale heating oil contract ranged between 41.80 cents a gallon and 42.05 cents, compared with Monday's settlement price of 41.68 cents. Fahd's statement could indicate <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ the world's biggest crude exporter _ was moving to take a leadership role and lower its own oil production, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Konikowski </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Two years ago when oil prices hit similar lows, Saudi production curbs helped reverse the market's decline, traders `` If the king says he does n't want the market to go much lower you would think the Saudis would set some limits,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an energy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It looks like prices are going to stabilize in this range.'' Monday's early selloff was fueled by anxieties about the continuing world oil glut. Analysts said <PERSON> Fahd </PERSON>'s statement came as the market was looking for positive news following a string of negative indicators that had steadily eroded prices. Fahd's statement, reported by the official <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> following a weekly government Cabinet session, had a strong impact on the market because the king rarely makes public statement related to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, brokers said. Before the statement was released, analysts had focused on the inability of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s 13 members to keep within their production quotas despite the worldwide oversupply of oil. After predicting prices could drop below $ 13 a barrel by week's end, some analysts reversed their position by the end of Monday's session, saying such an assessment was now overly <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are scheduled to meet in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, Nov. 21. As more oil floods the market, refiners have taken advantage of the bargain rates to pad their inventories before winter, analysts said. Normally, refiners build up inventories during the summer months, but with refineries near capacity, the extra oil is going into storage rather than refining. `` Everyone thinks prices are probably at the lowest they're going to see through the remainder of the year,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, senior principal and engineer at <ORGANIZATION> Purvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gertz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> petroleum consulting firm in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>

On Monday, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had a 90-minute private talk in northwestern <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> with President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>, whose Marxist government has accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of supporting an 11-year-old rebel insurgency. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> gave assurances to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> that this support had ceased and invited <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to continue talks on increased cooperation. The refugees who are to receive the gift of corn in <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION> are residents of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> who have fled the fighting there. In Mzuzu, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Banda </PERSON> issued a joint statement reaffirming the friendly relations between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malawi </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Panel Says Redesigned Booster Appears Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A committee that has been looking over <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s shoulder as the space shuttle booster rockets were redesigned said today it is satisfied no safety issues stand in the way of a launch late this month or early in October The report, however, disclosed for the first time that a crack had been found in a strut among stored booster parts and that `` the implications of the occurrence of this defect'' on the upcoming flight `` are being evaluated.'' But the committee, in a report to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>, said, `` We have no basis for objection to the current launch schedule for STS-26,'' the next flight. The report was submitted by <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stever </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s panel on the redesign of the shuttle booster rockets. A leak in the joint between the bottom two of the four segments that make up the booster was blamed for the Challenger disaster. `` During the redesign activity, two booster components were found to have structural safety factors that did not satisfy specifications,'' the report said. A redesigned aft skirt on the booster `` has failed to meet the ultimate design load condition required in the specifications,'' the report said, but will not affect flight safety. The other problem is the cracked strut that was found among stored parts. `` We understand that the struts installed in STS-26 had been inspected in accordance with procedures and proof tested and that the implications of the occurrence of this defect for STS-26 are being evaluated,'' <PERSON> Stever </PERSON> wrote. Top space agency managers are meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for a flight readiness review today and Wednesday. Presumably this was an issue on the agenda. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> committee's report was the seventh since it was assigned the task of monitoring the shuttle's return to flight but was not as critical as others have been. The committee said the five design features thought to have contributed to the Challenger explosion have been fixed. But the panel said it was `` disappointed to learn'' of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s money-saving decision to evaluate the redesign with special instrumentation on only the first three flights. `` While not every test that the panel and others might have desired was conducted before the return to flight, it is clear that the current test program has been considerably more extensive and thorough than the test program that preceded the first shuttle launch,'' the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said. `` As a consequence, we conclude that <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> can have commensurately more confidence in the redesigned SRM -LRB- solid rocket motor -RRB- than it had in the original design.''

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and a former aide took money out of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> and were indifferent to the ministry's financial woes, a <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorney says In a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> hearing expected to last all week, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> representatives are trying to regain $ 52 million they contend the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and former aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> took through mismanagement of funds, cash advances on <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> credit cards and unjustified compensation, benefits and fees. As the trial began Monday, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leggett </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> were uninterested in money problems `` while taking money out at times faster than it was coming in.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, an accountant and financial director at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> from June 1979 through July 1987, testified he routinely warned <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> of financial troubles. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> testified today that he was continually frustrated by a `` lack of financial integrity'' on the part of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other ministry executives. Memos regarding cost reductions and a limit of expenditures were either ignored or inadequately addressed, he charged. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> lawyer <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> told Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who is hearing the case without a jury, that the continuing financial crisis <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> experienced under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s leadership was not unusual. `` Every ministry of this type in the nation had the same type of financial crisis,'' he said. The Bakkers and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> were not in court Monday or today, but <PERSON> Hovis </PERSON> told reporters he plans to call them as witnesses when it is time to present their case. Meanwhile, bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> filed papers in court saying he could n't meet Monday's deadline to recommend a buyer for the ministry's assets. He asked for an extension until Sept. 27 to continue negotiations. In court Monday, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> lawyers maintained that the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> took huge personal bonuses while bills were n't being paid, and used money that was raised to build hotels as general operating funds. Entered into court records were numerous memos from <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> recommending such things as cutting expenses, reducing payroll and using competitive bidding for construction jobs. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said some staff members were hesitant to approach <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> with information about financial problems. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> -RRB- was out there planning and building, and he had a saying _ he did n't want to hear any bad news,'' <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> lawyers used internal documents to detail the ministry's problems from 1984-1987 They cited bonuses given to the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> at the same time the ministry was having serious financial problems.

<TEXT>
 A third of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> adults questioned in a recent survey said they personally know a teen-ager who either committed suicide or tried to, according to a report released today. A separate study of high-achieving teen-agers, meanwhile, disclosed that 30 percent said they have considered suicide and 45 percent know someone who has tried it, or succeeded. The national survey of 1,000 adults, questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>, found that 27 percent of those questioned said they knew a teen-ager who had tried to kill themselves and 17 percent knew a teen-ager who had killed themselves. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Riter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Riter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, Md. company that conducted the survey, said there was overlapping and that a net of 32 percent of those questioned knew a teen-ager in one of the two categories. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meeks </PERSON>, a child psychiatrist and a professor at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the study was `` reassuring'' in the sense it showed adults realize that modern teen-agers face severe problems. `` Teen-agers frequently worry that adults do n't take their problems seriously,'' <PERSON> Meeks </PERSON> said at a news conference. Entitled `` Teen-agers at Risk: an Adult Perspective,'' the survey also found that 72.4 percent of those interviewed think teen-agers today face far more serious problems than they did at the same age. The survey commissioned by the Washington-based organization also found that adults focused on three major areas of concern when asked about 10 specific problems facing adolescents: drug abuse, alcohol abuse and peer pressure. Slightly more than 87 percent said drug abuse was an `` overwhelming'' concern, alcohol abuse was second and peer pressure third. Unwanted pregnancy ranked fourth with 70.8 percent. A cluster appeared around the next five areas: Child abuse, 56 percent; crime among teen-agers, 54 percent; depression 53 percent; conflict with parents 53 percent; and suicide 53 percent. The 10th greatest concern was runaway behavior at 44.5 percent. Notwithstanding the concern expressed for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s youth, 47 percent of those questioned agreed that when a teen-ager is admitted to a psychiatric hospital `` it puts a cloud over this person's head for the rest of his @ her life.'' And 86.3 percent agreed to some degree that `` families find it difficult to admit that their children need professional psychiatric help.'' Of those questioned, 17.1 percent had teen-age children and 31.5 percent had children under 12. Grandparents represented 30.7 percent of the sample. The survey of high-achieving teen-agers was conducted by polling youths listed in the directory `` Who's <ORGANIZATION> Who </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Among </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>.'' Four percent of the 2,024 respondents said they had actually attempted suicide. It was the fourth year for that study. During that period the share who said they knew someone who has tried suicide rose from 40 percent to 45 percent; those considering it were up from 28 percent to 30 percent, and those who tried edged up from 3 percent to 4 percent.

<HEAD>Stowaway's Parents Say She Was Sexually Abused on U.S. Navy Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Irish teen-ager who stowed away on a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> destroyer was sexually abused and supplied with drugs while detained against her will on the ship for 10 days, an attorney for the girl's parents said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, parents of <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, wrote <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckler </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, that they plan legal action against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for alleged conduct that `` may have amounted to kidnapping.'' <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> said Monday, `` We do n't have anything to substantiate a charge of kidnapping.'' But he declined to comment on the drug or sex abuse allegations. Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON>, 17, was found aboard the destroyer Conyngham on July 22, a day before it reached its home port, <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. The girl apparently had slipped aboard on July 12 while the ship was in <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and was concealed by several crewmen, officials said. Four Conyngham sailors face October courts-martial on charges of aiding and harboring an alien. Four others face an administrative hearing on less serious charges. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, an attorney in <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> for the Twomeys, wrote Ms. <PERSON> Heckler </PERSON> that the teen-ager's stay aboard the <PERSON> Conyngham </PERSON> was `` unlawful, against her will, involuntary and might have amounted to kidnapping.'' `` It appears that during the course of her unlawful detention Ms. <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> was, on a number of occasions, supplied with narcotics and, in addition, was repeatedly sexually abused,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> quoted an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> official as saying that Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> apparently intended to ride on the ship, because she boarded it herself with a bag containing clothes, books and a radio or cassette player. Irish officials have said that Miss <PERSON> Twomey </PERSON> has run away from home several times, once to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. She is now under the care of Irish health officials, who said they applied for custody `` in the interests of the girl herself and after consultation with her parents and the police.''

<TEXT>
 Police launched stun grenades into a home, then stormed it early today to end a 10-hour stand-off with a gunman who had sprayed the neighborhood with hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Police said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumpel </PERSON>, 56, was not holding hostages but he refused to surrender, despite numerous pleas from police who took cover to escape the barrage of fire. No one was injured, but dozens of nearby residents were evacuated. Officers found <PERSON> Kumpel </PERSON> barricaded in a back bedroom clutching two handguns. The man did not fire on the officers, police said. Authorities said <PERSON> Kumpel </PERSON> and his wife had been having marital problems in recent weeks. `` He was acting erratic. ... He was threatening to kill himself and his family,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhoads </PERSON>. The ordeal in this south suburb of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> started about 4:10 p.m. when neighbors called to say the man was threatening to kill himself and others, police said. Officers were able to get the man's wife and daughter away from the home before the man started firing, police said. Authorities said they waited for 10 hours before entering the home because they feared the house was booby trapped, a fear they later said was unfounded.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge ruled that only limited discussion will be allowed in the jury's presence about the sexual history of a 19-year-old woman whose complaint of a gang rape led to the indictment of 10 men on charges ranging from kidnapping to sexual assault. After lengthy pre-trial motions by defense attorneys, jury selection finally began late Monday and continued today in the sexual assault trial of <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, 23, the first of several scheduled as a result of the woman's allegations. State District Judge <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> granted a prosecution motion to block references to the woman's sexual history in the presence of the jury without first determining whether such discussion would be admissible evidence. Defense attorney <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> protested that prior sexual behavior `` touches on the very basis of the defense of consent.'' <PERSON> Pena </PERSON> told the jury pool they would have to ignore the extensive media coverage the case has attracted since the 19-year-old woman said she was abducted and gang raped March 26. The woman told authorities she was abducted while walking home from a relative's house and raped over four hours by as many as 20 men. She said the attack began at a ranch north of town where a cockfight was being held, and that her attackers urged men at the cockfight to join in. Some did, despite her pleas of help, she said. Ten men were indicted on various kidnapping or sexual assault charges. A 14-year-old youth also has been charged. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, also faces a later trial on a charge of aggravated kidnapping. The judge denied motions by the defense to replace the jury panel. The defense had tried to show that an inordinate number of the potential jurors were relatives of one of the prosecutors and residents of areas the county where the prosecutor's family has a `` historical political stronghold.''

<HEAD>Reputed Honduras Drug Lord on Trial for Escape</HEAD>

 The escape trial of a reputed drug lord whose recapture touched off riots in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> was headed into its final stages after just one hour of testimony. With extra security guards posted outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Court, closing arguments were scheduled today in the trial of <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>, 43, who faces charges of escaping from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Camp </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Eglin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in 1971. His trial opened Monday. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was serving a three-year sentence at the air base in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> for illegally entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He allegedly slipped out the back door of a chapel at the minimum-security prison during church services. Evidence was covered in only an hour of testimony after a 12-member jury was selected Monday. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> produced evidence that shortly before he left the prison, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> had been told his mother was ill. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> had also challenged the escape charge on grounds <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was illegally seized, but his argument was rejected by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> Honduran police captured <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> on April 5, using helicopters to raid his home. Police then put him on a flight to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which in turn put him on a flight for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals arrested him. His return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> touched off rioting in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, by students, leftists and others who contended the extradition was barred by the Honduran constitution. Several protesters were killed and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Consulate was burned. At the time of his arrest in April, <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> had been living openly in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, since 1986 when he escaped from a Colombian prison, where he had been held on charges involving the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> expelled the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> ambassador and another envoy today after the junior diplomat wounded one man when he fired a gun at people he believed were following him. With a wry smile and a wave, Ambassador <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez-Mell </PERSON> was driven from his official residence in north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to catch a flight to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, within the 24-hour expulsion deadline set by British officials. The ambassador, accompanied by his wife and 12-year-old son, picked up another diplomat, believed to be the gunman, Third Secretary <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, at the embassy en route to <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Police said anti-terrorist squad detectives had traced one man who was slightly injured in the Monday afternoon shooting and added they were satisfied he `` was not posing a threat to anyone.'' In a statement, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> police headquarters said it would not release the identify of the injured man, adding the police inquiry into the shooting was closed. Speculation grew about the group that <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, described as a commercial attache in the diplomatic list, claimed was stalking him. The British radio reports quoted the Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying on <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> radio that the expulsion was `` arbitrary and unjust'' and that <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was being followed by a Cuban exile who had tried to get the diplomat to defect. The Daily Mail said he believed he was being trailed by an assassination squad. The Daily Express the group were members of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s MI5 counter-intelligence agency, `` who watch Cuban diplomats round the clock.'' It added that <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said he opened fire in panic because he thought the group were agents of the government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which supports pro-Western guerrillas who oppose the Cuban-backed Marxist government of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The government acknowledged a shooting incident on Monday but provided few details. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in a radio interview said the British retaliation was `` excessive,'' The Foreign Office in a statement retorted, `` We have reacted appropriately to a totally unacceptable and outrageous action on the streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told police he fired because he was afraid for his safety. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said he was released from police custody after he claimed diplomatic immunity. Foreign Office Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> summoned Fernandez-Mell to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> after the shooting and told the ambassador that he and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who also held the embassy post of commercial attache, were being expelled. In a later statement, <PERSON> Eggar </PERSON> called the expulsions `` an indication of how strongly we feel ... We are not prepared to have this kind of behavior in the streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' The Daily Mail reported said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> barricaded himself in the official Cuban apartment after the incident. It said two police officers negotiated with <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> from an adjacent balcony. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> fired up to five shots at a car with four people inside. It quoted an unidentified witness as saying she saw the four run away, one holding a blood-soaked handkerchief to his head. British authorities refused comment on the news reports. In a nation where ordinary police do not carry guns, weapons possession by diplomats is a grave issue. It became particularly sensitive after a gunman fired from the Libyan Embassy during a protest demonstration in April 1984, killing a British policewoman. After a police siege, the embassy was shut and diplomatic ties cut. On Sunday, Vietnamese Third Secretary <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> <PERSON> Than </PERSON> <PERSON> Nhan </PERSON> left <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, expelled by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after the <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> ambassador turned in a gun he said <PERSON> Khang </PERSON> waved Sept. 4 during a demonstration by British-based Vietnamese refugees. The Vietnamese ambassador first handed over a toy gun but later returned with a real one and apologized, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Hoodlums burned down a <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> chapel in a slum overnight after six self-proclaimed killers boasted on government television that they participated in Sunday's massacre at another church. The Chapel of Immaculate Conception in the sprawling Cite Soleil slum burst into flames at 11 p.m. Monday and burned to the ground. Reporters who rushed to the scene were chased away by the arsonists, <ORGANIZATION> Radio-Soleil </ORGANIZATION> reported. One of the men who appeared on television was recognized by a <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> reporter at the scene of chapel fire. Empty gasoline cans littered the area around the The chapel is served by the Rev. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Volel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Salesian </LOCATION> priest known in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for his work with the poor. The Salesian Fathers specialize in vocational training. A <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> vocational school was partially damaged on Sunday when St. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON>, the church of the Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Salesian </LOCATION> priest, was attacked by thugs armed with handguns, sharpened steel pikes and machetes. The assailants shot, stabbed and slashed at parishioners and then burned down the church and several vehicles parked outside. Radio Haiti-Inter reported today the casualty toll from Sunday's massacre had reached six dead and 77 wounded `` The government has committed a genocide on an unarmed people. It is for the international community to put a stop to it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Sylvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> declared on Radio Metropole this morning. Five men and a woman spoke on Radio Metropole and Tele-Haiti Monday afternoon before appearing on <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION>, the government network, and declared they had participated in Sunday's massacre at Aristide's church The six made no attempt to hide their identity and spoke on the government-controlled network without apparent fear of reprisal. They claimed the violence was related to an internal conflict within the church and threatened `` a heap of corpses'' at future Masses. `` We were after Father <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>; what you saw yesterday -LRB- Sunday -RRB- was child's play. In whatever parish <PERSON> Father </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> is accepted, a heap of corpses will attend that Mass,'' a spokesman for the group said on the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> broadcast. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, one of the most popular figures among the poor masses in this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> nation, regularly has preached against army atrocities and has led his supporters in street demonstrations. The priest has been the target of several assassination attempts. During the 9 a.m. Mass on Sunday about 300 people stoned Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION> in the La Saline slum. Then two dozen men with guns and machetes burst into the church began killing people. Soldiers watched from across the street and did nothing, radio stations and witnesses said. The assailants then set the church on fire. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> escaped unhurt and went into hiding. Witnesses at the church said they recognized some of the attackers as city hall employees, but did not identify them. <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, a former colonel in ex-dictator <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> `` Papa Doc'' <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s presidential guard and former chief of police under <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, denied city hall had been involved, although he said <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was `` justly punished'' in the attack. `` If -LRB- city -RRB- employees were involved ... I do n't see how I am concerned. I am not someone who preaches violence and who sends people out to die as <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> has always done,'' <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> Monday. `` He who sows the wind, reaps the storm.'' <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> mayor until the younger <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s ouster on Feb. 7, 1986, returned to that office in army-run elections in January, and remained after Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ousted President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> in a coup on June 19, ending four months of civilian rule. `` His -LRB- <PERSON> Romain </PERSON>'s -RRB- name is well-connected with the worse offenders of human rights under <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latortue </PERSON>, a Haitian economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puerto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rico </ORGANIZATION> and a former senatorial candidate, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in San Juan Monday. <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>, who lives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, denounced the incident as the work of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s secret police. `` Brute force is the principal instrument of those who now control the country,'' <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON> said from his home in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Among those injured were a woman and her infant _ both skewered by the same homemade, steel pike while the baby girl was in her mother's womb. An operation saved mother and child. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> condemned the behavior of the police.

The warm, dry winds that drove the fire across 40 square miles of terrain covered with timber and brush continued this morning as sleep-starved firefighters struggled to hold their own against the 70-foot-high flames. `` We probably have as extreme a condition as anywhere in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or anywhere in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> today,'' said operations director <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Waggoner </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. At least 149 structures, including 92 homes, were destroyed in an area about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, authorities said. Some of the homes were valued at $ 1 million. Fire officials stressed that many more houses are still in extreme danger, especially Rough and Ready, a community of about 500 residents _ all evacuated _ in the heavily wooded bottom of a steep canyon on the edge of the fire. Fire planning chief <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said saving Rough and Ready was one of the top priorities today, but he cautioned that it was a particularly dangerous area for firefighters because of the limited access on a narrow road. `` If we have shifty winds, we're not going to sit around in there,'' <PERSON> Iverson </PERSON> said. A preliminary estimate by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> put the loss in structures alone at more than $ 9 million, and the figure was expected to climb much higher. `` I was coming back from the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, sitting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and I see my father's house burning on television,'' said insurance agent <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanzone </PERSON>, 41. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mowner </PERSON>, a state forestry spokesman, said the continued stiff winds and low humidity were hampering firefighting. `` I would say the fire will burn actively overnight,'' he said early today. Before dawn, <PERSON> Mowner </PERSON>'s prediction was borne out, as <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> officials reported that the fire had grown overnight from 25 to 40 square miles. The only good news, <PERSON> Mowner </PERSON> said, was that the fire was spreading into an area east of <LOCATION> Beale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Force </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION>, where there were fewer homes. `` That could help us,'' he said. `` We've been spending an awful lot of time and manpower protecting structures, so the main fire has been burning relatively freely.'' More than 1,000 firefighters had been added to the lines Monday and today, bringing the total to nearly 2,800 battling the blaze, said forestry department spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Finlayson </PERSON>. The blaze began early Sunday when a transient set fire to toilet paper. The unidentified man was cited for burning without a permit and released, authorities said. About 4,500 residents of the affluent <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> area were forced from their homes Sunday and Monday as erratic winds shifted the blaze. At least 3,500 people have been evacuated from the nearby communities of <LOCATION> Smartville </LOCATION>, Rough and Ready, and <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, since Sunday. Two firefighters suffered second - and third-degree burns Their conditions were not immediately available. The fire jumped Highway 20 and headed southwest on Monday, threatening hundreds of scattered, rural dwellings and forcing the latest round of evacuations. `` There are hundreds here and they are pouring in,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quirk </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> evacuation center. `` The school buses are bringing in senior citizens, and there are campers and motor homes in the parking lot.'' Most schools were closed in the region. Thick smoke made it unsafe to operate school buses, and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> converted at least three schools into temporary evacuation centers. By early today, the fire had burned an estimated 25,000 acres, or nearly 40 square miles, of western <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Flames threatened the high-technology <ORGANIZATION> Grass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the county's largest employer with 1,000 workers. The fire reached three sides of the company's sprawling grounds, and destroyed a storage shed. The company produces video equipment used at television stations, and makes special-effects software for national television broadcasts. The <ORGANIZATION> Yuba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> met late Monday in emergency session to declare the zone a local disaster area, and expressed concern that the fire may threaten <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, 20 miles to the west of the fire and the home base of the SR-71 `` Blackbird'' spy plane. The blaze was fueled by drought-dry brush, wood roofs and exploding propane tanks, said state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jakobs </PERSON>. The greatest concentration of damage was around <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION>, where at least 15 homes, five boats and a dock were destroyed. Nineteen other structures outside of the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> area were destroyed, including several residential trailers and agricultural buildings. Another fire about 80 miles west of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wildwood </LOCATION> in the coast range of <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> blackened more than 10 square miles, destroyed several structures and temporarily threatened <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s geothermal plants. Altogether, almost a dozen fires destroyed nearly 30,000 acres of timber and brush in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Monday. About 5,000 firefighters were on fire lines statewide.

 Airlines, already pinched by deregulatory competition and a pilot shortage, may have trouble staffing their cockpits and paying additional salaries if researchers say pilots should fly reduced schedules. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> scheduling regulations have changed little since the 1930s, when lumbering prop planes rarely crossed more than one time zone a day. Among those who think they can be improved is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>, a sleep researcher on the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` An arbitrary restriction on flight and duty time and mandatory rest time that does n't take into account circadian factors is simply not 20th century,'' he said. `` We know that an hour of sleep is not an hour of sleep, depending on when you take it. One of the biggest improvements we could make in our regulations would be to recognize those factors and adjust schedules appropriately.'' The experts contend that schedules should consider the time of departure, the number of time zones crossed and the direction of travel. -LRB- The body adjusts more quickly when traveling west to east than east to west. -RRB- Another part of the problem is the plane itself. The modern cockpit is a fine place for involuntary slumber. The lights are dim. The seats are comfortable. The air rushes past with a soothing hum. Planes are so automated that they quite literally fly themselves. Except while landing and taking off, there is often little for crew members to do. The newest planes do n't even require a flight engineer, so standard crew size is being reduced from three members to two. Some pilots and sleep experts complain that this increases the odds the entire crew will doze off. `` The fewer people in the cockpit, the fewer safeguards you have,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore-Ede </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, a sleep expert at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's easier for two people to nod off than three.'' But <PERSON> Delmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadden </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> administrator, asserts just the opposite is likely: `` If there are only two in the cockpit, both know that they ca n't rely on a third person, so they are more attentive to the tasks they are doing and are much less likely to allow themselves to go to sleep.'' <PERSON> Fadden </PERSON>, who establishes design requirements for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and 767, said, `` We ca n't do a lot about the fact that the crew might be fatigued. What we try to do is make the airplane tolerant of the crew's reaction.'' This means designing planes to be safe even when flown by bored, drowsy, inattentive pilots. If something goes wrong, such as a generator failure, the plane automatically compensates without waiting for the crew to act. <PERSON> Fadden </PERSON> said some planes being built will monitor their crews. Alarms will sound if pilots do nothing for 20 minutes. Such a lapse of activity could mean the pilots are daydreaming or worse. Another possible solution, used by the British during the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> crisis, is a drug to help pilots sleep before night flights. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Storm </PERSON>, a psychologist at <ORGANIZATION> Brooks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military is experimenting with the drug temazepam. All of these suggested changes are intended to lessen the chance that cockpit fatigue will combine with bad weather, equipment failure and other random hazards to trigger a disaster. `` We run a very safe air transportation system,'' said <PERSON> Lauber </PERSON>. `` But we are pushing people harder. We know from anecdotal data that people are not as alert as they should be. They are falling asleep in some circumstances. I think it's appropriate that we re-examine the way we approach these things.''

 A sixth member of an ethnic coalition supporting Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential candidacy resigned today as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared that `` there is n't one iota of discrimination'' among the group's members. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said the resignation of <PERSON> Radi </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavoff </PERSON> as national co-chairman of Bulgarians for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was accepted today. <PERSON> Slavoff </PERSON> quit the campaign after the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer identified him over the weekend as former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Bulgarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which the paper said was formed after World War II by members of the Nazi-aligned Bulgarian Legion. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> he believed five other ethnic advisers resigned Monday `` because they did n't want to harm the campaign.'' The president was not asked specifically about the resignation of <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a key <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> operative and deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> who was named in a published report about possibly anti-Semitic activities during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration. Asked whether he thought the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign suffered from an appearance of anti-Semitism among some of the vice president's supporters, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` No. Asked to elaborate, he said, `` Because I know him -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- and I know the people involved and there is n't an iota of discrimination in any of them.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> commented after a Rose Garden ceremony where he signed fair housing legislation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the five former officials of the ethnic coalition said the controversy was politically motivated. `` We are resigning today from the ` <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION>' and removing ourselves from the controversy because we have been attacked unfairly by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s political opponents,'' the five said in a statement Monday issued by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. The statement did not name the opponents. In announcing the resignations, <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign conducted a review of the allegations and found nothing to substantiate the reports. `` The charges appear to be politically inspired by individuals who wish to divert public attention from the issues of the campaign,'' <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said. `` Nonetheless, we believe these individuals have done the right thing by removing themselves from the controversy.'' Asked about the resignations during a campaign stop in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters, `` Nobody's giving in. These people left of their own volition. We're not accusing anybody of anything.'' The vice president added, `` We're getting into a very peculiar deal where some people are accusing people. I do n't like it a bit.'' The controversy arose after publication last week of an article in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jewish Week, which said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign committee included <PERSON> Florian </PERSON> <PERSON> Galdau </PERSON>, described as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chief of the Iron Guard, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi movement, and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest listed as member of an illegal, neo-fascist Italian group. <PERSON> Galdau </PERSON>, honorary chairman of the committee, and <PERSON> Guarino </PERSON>, the coalition's vice chairman, were among the five who resigned. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pasztor </PERSON>, described in the article as a Hungarian-American who served in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s pro-Nazi, anti-Semitic <PERSON> Arrowcross </PERSON> as a youth, also resigned. The other two committee members to step down were <PERSON> Ignatius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilinsky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bohdan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fedorak </PERSON>. Their alleged activities were not immediately known. In the statement, the former coalition members said, `` these Sasso-like attacks are aimed at neutralizing the strong support which <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has and will continue to have in the ethnic community.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, a top aide to <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, was forced to resign last year after he circulated the so-called `` attack video'' against former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate Sen. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> rejoined the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign during the Labor Day weekend. On Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment after the additional resignations. `` I think it raises continuing questions about Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, also raising as an issue <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as his running mate The resignations came one day after <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointee to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, stepped down after a published report said that while <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> served in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration he compiled a list of Jewish employees in top posts at the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide to President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>'s resignation was politically `` exactly the right thing to do,'' but that <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> was the victim of a `` bum rap'' because he was only following <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s orders. <PERSON> Ehrlichman </PERSON>, interviewed on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Morning'' show, said <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s order to determine whether a `` Jewish cabal'' existed at the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency was `` pure <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> venting spleen'' and `` rhetorical excess'' that his aides usually ignored. He said <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> was `` the farthest thing from a bigot of anybody I know.'' The decision by the five committee members also comes less than a week after the coalition's co-chairman <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Brentar </PERSON> was dismissed following the disclosure that he had defended <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>, the one-time <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> autoworker convicted in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a Nazi war criminal. He was also reported to be active in groups that questioned whether the Holocaust had actually occurred. No replacements for the five committee members have been named, <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said.

 Americans spent $ 449 million more than normal last month to keep their cool. That's the word from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which said that August's steamy weather raised the national electricity bill to nearly $ 4.3 billion. The average residential electricity bill came to $ 104 in August, $ 11 more than normal, according to the monthly climate impact assessment issued by <ORGANIZATION> NOAA </ORGANIZATION>. Costs varied widely by region, however, ranging from a high of $ 137 per residence for the month in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> states to a low of $ 50 along the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. The West North Central region was farthest above normal, while electricity costs in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> states were a dollar below normal. Normal cooling costs are defined as what it would be expected to cost to cool a residence in average August weather, based on temperature records for the past 30 years. Here is a rundown of the estimated August residential electricity bills in each region and their difference from what would have been expected in a normal August: _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>, $ 137, $ 10 above normal Includes <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. _ East South Central, $ 118, $ 12 above normal Includes <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>, $ 113, $ 20 above normal Includes <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, $ 113, $ 7 above normal Includes <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. _ East North Central, $ 99, $ 19 above normal Includes <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>, $ 90, $ 12 above normal Includes <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. _ Mountain, $ 82, $ 3 above normal Includes <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, $ 61, $ 9 above normal Includes <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. _ <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, $ 50, $ 1 below normal Includes <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Diarrhea Epidemic Worsens As Flood Waters Recede</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARLEEN FISHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Patches of foul-smelling mud emerged Tuesday as flood waters filled with sewage and rotting garbage continued to recede, and the government fought a losing battle against a diarrhea epidemic. Although vast sections of the nation remained under several feet of water, land emerged in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> and other areas where millions of people were living in waterlogged homes and makeshift shelters because their houses were flooded. The number of officially reported diarrhea cases rose sharply, and a senior health ministry official warned of major health hazards. `` The filth caused by flooding and the millions of gallons of sewage and tons of rotting garbage are posing a serious threat to the health of 6 million people'' in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The government's press information department said 33,054 new cases of diarrhea were reported across the country in the past 24 hours. That's more than triple the number of cases reported on a daily basis a week ago. Tuesday's report brought to 283,703 the number of officially recorded diarrhea cases since Aug. 27, when the last round of flooding began. The information department said the number of diarrhea deaths since then was 150. The total number of flood deaths since June 13 _ when the summer floods started, then receded before rising to new heights in late August _ was 893, according to a government reports. But daily reports in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers said 1,723 people died from drowning, snake bites, house collapsing and diseases. The real number is impossible to ascertain, given <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s unwieldy bureaucracy and communications that were poor even before floods that covered three-quarters of the nation The <ORGANIZATION> Flood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said all major rivers, including the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Meghna </PERSON>, continued to fall by 1 -LCB- to 2 inches a day. In most places this meant the rivers were still 16 to 27 inches above flood level. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, toured floded areas Tuesday and told reporters he knew the water was receding, but `` It's worse than I expected at this stage _ it's one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.'' <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> on Monday aboard a transport plane bearing part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'s promised $ 150 million in relief materials. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>'s tour included the village of Maosaid 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> where he distribuited about 350 food packets that were prepared by the Care relief organization with funds from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Families designated by Care field workers received the packages after waiting five hours for <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>' arrival at a Roman Catholic church where flood waters lapped at the steps. Behind the church is a home for retarded girls operated by the <ORGANIZATION> Sisters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charity </ORGANIZATION>, the order headed by <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize. Sister <PERSON> Blaise </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Ranchi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, said she and the six other Indian and Bangladeshi nuns had to tie the girls to keep them from falling into three feet of water that flooded their dormitory two weeks ago. The dormitory is now above water, but most of the village is a sea of ankle-deep mud with pools of stagnated water. Sister <PERSON> Marie-Noel </PERSON> said most people in the village were eating one meal a day because food stores were low, and the nuns were taking rice and lentils from their dwindling stock to nearby areas where people had lost their homes.

 Firefighters took advantage of a cold spell to make some headway against blazes that have devastated much of this famed park before hotter, drier weather returns. `` The fire people realize that things could heat up again this week,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Capek </PERSON>. `` The fires are still a threat; we are not out of it yet. We know there is some more fire time left in the season, but hopefully it wo n't be as intense.'' Temperatures were only in the 40s this morning while the force of some 8,000 firefighters worked to strengthen existing firebreaks and prepare to protect the areas of <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, if necessary. <PERSON> Jardine </PERSON> and park headquarters at Mammoth were evacuated before rain and snow fell over the weekend. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today that the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy of letting naturally caused fires burn in national forests had been scrapped in the wake of the Yellowstone fires. Asked what he thought of the policy, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters, `` I have questioned it. I did not even know it existed, frankly.'' He said that <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> has `` made it plain that ... we were withdrawing from this policy.'' Updated forecasts for the area said the sky would be cloudy through Wednesday, with highs rising to around 60 degrees and isolated showers expected late today. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a fast-moving fire continued to burn out of control today in the Gold Rush country of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> foothills, but firefighters said it was 30 percent contained. That blaze, which covered 40 square miles early today, has consumed about 150 buildings, including more than 90 homes, and forced the evacuation of more than 8,000 people. The fire was spreading into an area east of <ORGANIZATION> Beale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, a less populated area, and a forestry spokesman said firefighters may be able to spend less time protecting structures and devote more energy on containing the blaze. But fire officials stressed that many houses were still in extreme danger, especially in Rough and Ready, a community of about 500 residents in the heavily wooded bottom of a steep canyon on the edge of the fire. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, fires burned in a remote section of <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and in <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Norte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> border. Fires also burned Monday in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. The Interagency Fire Center in <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, which coordinates firefighting efforts in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, calls this the worst forest fire season in 30 years. Temperatures at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> remained in the 40s Monday, keeping humidity at up to 50 percent., but the weather was expected to begin clearing today and the mercury was expected to climb to 70 degrees by Wednesday. `` It's a sleeping giant now,'' said incident commander <PERSON> Denny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> during a briefing. `` We want to tie it down so when it wakes up it ca n't run on us.'' The historic fires have charred 939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park since June. About 1,000 Marines from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were to reach <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> today to bolster firefighters. Some of the first soldiers sent to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, were not to be released until at least Saturday. `` We'll have lots of people here, so maybe we can nail this thing,'' <PERSON> Bungarz </PERSON> said. Firefighters worked Monday to strengthen fire lines and attack hot spots as officials worked to establish a fire camp at Mammoth Hot Springs. The favorable weather allowed park officials to open all roads through the park except the northeast entrance leading to <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, where workers were repairing roads. Despite the return of warmer weather, the arrival of fall, with lower temperatures and shorter days, had officials optimistic the fires would make no more major advances. `` We still expect fire activity, but it wo n't be as intense or as much or as fast as it has been in the past,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Capek </PERSON>. `` The days are getting shorter, so the burning period is getting shorter.'' Officials were also hopeful that a heavy snow will throw a wet, white blanket on the fires soon. Light snow fell on Yellowstone Sunday. `` We can generally expect some pretty good snowfalls in September and early October,'' said the park's chief researcher, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Varley </PERSON>. `` We usually have a pretty good snowstorm around the equinox -LRB- Sept. 21 -RRB-, and I think we've all got our fingers crossed that that will indeed come and put a further damper on the fires.'' Elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area, firefighters in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> hoped to control a 38,000-acre fire by tonight. In northwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, crews made progress in their battle against a 31,500-acre fire burning in and near Glacier National Park. Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> lifted a sweeping ban on all outdoor recreational activities that was imposed because of fire danger. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, crews were pulled from fire lines Monday when drizzle, rain and snow fell on the last of the forest fires that have scorched more than 13,000 acres.

 Freed West German hostage <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was reunited with his wife <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON> today after she flew from <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> with senior government officials to take him home. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> said he felt `` born again.'' Hugging his tearful wife tightly, <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was escorted by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> security officers to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> at 5 p.m. and turned over to West German government envoys by Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON>. `` I'm rejoicing for being a free man again. I feel I'm born again,'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> said. `` It is as if I have been granted a new life. I am feeling perfect, and I'm in a very good shape.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and his wife had an emotional reunion at the government guest house where he spent the night after his release. `` She fell into his arms and they kissed each other for a long time,'' an official who witnessed the reunion told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> turned to <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> army officers who escorted her from the airport to the guest house and said: `` Thank you. Thank you so much.'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, 55, was released late Monday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists who kidnapped him in January 1987. He was driven to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> by Brig. <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammoud </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s military intelligence chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was the last West German hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where 17 other foreigners are held captive. Asked today if he had seen any of the other hostages, he said: `` I have n't seen any hostages. I was alone.'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' captors said his release was linked to a Lebanese Shiite on trial in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for the 1985 hijacking of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jet and the shooting death of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. In a note issued in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, they said if <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s release can not be gained legally, `` then we shall be obliged to again resort to violence. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and his wife were expected to drive from the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to the airport to take off in the Canadian-built twin-engined jet for the five-hour flight to a military airbase near <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. Seventeen foreigners, including nine Americans, are still missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and it is believed most are held by pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> kidnappers. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, a West German government spokesman, who asked not to be further identified, said he knew of no deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or with the kidnappers for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' freedom. The government has repeatedly denied that it paid a ransom for the release last September for <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, another West German who had been held captive in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said his government will use the country's ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to try gain freedom for other hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. And Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> credited <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s continuing ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for helping to bring about <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' release. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 in the week after <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s arrest in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, an engineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, 24, has acknowledged in a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court to hijacking the plane but denies killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. In the murder and air piracy trial Monday, the captain of the hijacked jetliner, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>, testified that he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> fired the shot that killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> aboard the aircraft. The kidnappers' note, one of three issued Monday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the decision to release <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> `` does not mean in any way the abandonment of holy warrior <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>.'' His brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, 29, is serving a 13-year prison sentence in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. He was convicted in April of complicity in kidnapping <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> in an effort to force <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. In another development, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said an American engineer who was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Sunday overpowered his captors and escaped to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> on Monday with the help of Syrian troops. Another version said Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> rescued the engineer, identified in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, after overpowering the kidnappers. The discrepancies could not immediately be reconciled. Gunmen abducted <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>, 25, who reportedly works in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> and holds a black belt in karate.

The <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> Democrat, perhaps better known for the extraordinarily long speech he delivered at the Democratic National Convention in July, has been heavily involved in congressional efforts to expand child care services and help welfare mothers. Representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> has testified numerous times on behalf of welfare reform bills and a $ 2.5 billion initiative designed to improve and expand child care. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, who left the administration this year to head Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s unsuccessful presidential bid, was cited `` for his behind-the-scenes support in the battle to maintain afirmative action programs.'' The caucus scheduled a Good Guy Awards Dinner on Tuesday night in honor of <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> and eight other `` men who have made special contributions to women's progress.''

 A firebombing apparently stemming from a $ 275 drug deal that went sour killed two young sisters who had been left alone in a locked room and critically injured a third, police said. The Sunday evening firebombing had been meant for another man in the building, authorities said. Police announced today that they have arrested one man and were expecting the surrender of a second later in the day. Lt. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollocher </PERSON> said investigators were seeking warrants charging both with two counts of first-degree murder, arson and assault. Their identities were not released pending formal filing of charges. Four men who had been with the suspects were being sought for questioning. Sgt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcinkiewicz </PERSON> of the bomb and arson squad said investigators had determined that two Molotov cocktails were thrown through a first-floor window of the three-story home. Firefighters rescued the children, who authorities said had been left unattended in a locked bedroom. But <PERSON> Erica </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 1, and <PERSON> Ashley </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 4, died later of smoke inhalation at Children's Hospital <PERSON> Lenora </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 5 months, was in critical condition this morning, a hospital spokeswoman said. The children's mother, <PERSON> Cassandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, 18, was not at home at the time of the firebombing because she and her boyfriend were out looking for her 16-year-old brother, who was allegedly involved in the drug deal, <PERSON> Marcinkiewicz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcinkiewicz </PERSON> said that shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday, six men stopped at the home and one of them paid $ 275 for drugs to the brother and another 16-year-olds. Instead of giving the man drugs, the two youths fled with the money, the investigator said. He said the car returned about 20 minutes later, and the firebombs were hurled into the house. Several family members said Ms. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> routinely locked her children in the bedroom to protect valuables she kept there. Other adults and children escaped without injury. A total of 15 people lived in the house, authorities said.

 A handicapped woman who persisted with efforts to help the needy even while she was homeless has been honored by the same federal agency that had her evicted last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> honored <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> at a luncheon Monday with a Presidential Recognition Award for her community service. The award covers 1987, the year she was locked out of her house, where she used to distribute groceries to fellow handicapped residents. Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> had lived rent-free in the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> home for five years, but the owners defaulted on their low-interest <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> loan and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshal padlocked the door last November. That left her a bit skeptical about <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. `` When <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> called to tell me I had won an award, I said, ` Sure.' Then I began to get letters telling me about it,'' she said. In July, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> sent correspondence that offered congratulations from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for her `` successful efforts to improve the nutritional well-being of low-income, handicapped persons.'' After she was evicted, Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> continued to help the needy, distributing food from a room at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> under a food giveaway program subsidized by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said she lived in her van for two months until a man who heard about her plight rented her a small house. `` I never stopped helping the handicapped,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who suffers from an arthritic spine and lives on a monthly Social Security check. Despite the eviction, Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> apparently harbors no bitterness. The commendation letter from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has an honored place in her home. `` Everyday when I sit down for dinner I look at it, smile and know that they do care about me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` I did n't think anybody paid any attention to me or even cared.

 The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has refused to hear the appeal of a gay bathhouse that was shut down by a court order under a new <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> enforcement policy aimed at combatting the spread of AIDS. The court's action Monday left intact the first such order under the county's policy, which requires any bathhouse in which anal or oral sex takes place to be closed as a public nuisance. A previous policy prohibited anal sex without condoms in bathhouses but did not seek to close the establishments. `` We were attempting to work with bathhouses, have them serve as education centers,'' said Deputy County Counsel <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnevale </PERSON>. `` We thought they would go away by themselves because they were losing business. It turned out that they were much larger than anybody expected.'' Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread largely through sexual contact and sharing of infected needles by drug abusers. In May, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials sought to close <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>'s bathhouse after an undercover investigation found numerous violations An injunction was issued Aug. 30. After a state appeals court refused to intervene, lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>'s appealed last week to the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Attorney <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Litt </PERSON> argued that the order closing Mac's was excessive because an order forbidding specific sexual practices would accomplish the same goal while protecting the privacy rights of the bathhouse's customers. Quoting a number of health experts, <PERSON> Litt </PERSON> said closing gay bathhouses would not reduce the risk of AIDS and would likely increase it. Sexual activities at bathhouses were `` safer than in the general population,'' he said. After the violations were found, Mac's required every patron to sign a copy of the rules, distributed cards stating the risk of specific types of sexual activities, and started showing `` safe sex'' videos, <PERSON> Litt </PERSON> said. The county still has about 10 bathhouses, which are generally making good-faith efforts to follow the rules prohibiting sexual intercourse, <PERSON> Carnevale </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> closed down its gay bathhouses.

 Heavy combat in northern rebel strongholds killed or wounded more than 80 leftists guerrillas and government troops, a military spokesman said today. Col. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said guerrillas attacked the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> garrison, headquarters of the 4th army brigade, in <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> province at 1:05 a.m. with mortar fire. Nine soldiers and five guerrillas died in the attack 37 miles north of the capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and 12 government troops were wounded, he said. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, head of the armed forces press office, also said there were a series of clashes in northern <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> province between government units and guerrillas. The rebels suffered 50 casualties in <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> and five soldiers were wounded, he said in a telephone interview. Both provinces are strongholds of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> Faribuno </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> where guerrillas move freely and even exercise some administration of towns and villages. He said the fighting at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> lasted two hours and officers on the scene believed `` quite a few'' rebels were wounded. The bodies of five rebels and six M-16 assault rifles were recovered, <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said. It was the first guerrilla attack on a brigade headquarters since a February assault on the 3rd brigade in eastern <LOCATION> Usulutan </LOCATION> province. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military adviser, the first to die in combat, was killed at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION> in March 1987 when rebels penetrated the base, killing 70 government soldiers. There are several dozen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military advisers at bases in <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said the fighting in <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> began at 4 p.m. Monday and lasted until 3 a.m. Tuesday. He called it a series of encounters between three government commando units of about 15 men each and a `` significant'' guerrilla column. Helicopters ferrying wounded soldiers and supplies were still coming under fire several hours after the main clashes ended, he said, and troops were still mopping up around <LOCATION> Gigante </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Perquin </LOCATION>, 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He said Col. <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON>, commander of the eastern military zone, told him at mid-morning there was still no breakdown between dead and wounded in the 50 guerrilla casualities. He said he did not know how many bodies had been recovered. There was no way to immediately confirm the official casualty figures. Earlier this month, the military claimed 25 rebels dead near <LOCATION> Tejutepeque </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. But reporters at the scene confirmed only four dead. Precise casualties are also hard to pin down because the rebels try to remove their dead from the battlefield.

 The president of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> complained to a congressional panel Tuesday that his institution should not have been frozen out of negotiations in the largest-ever government rescue of a savings association. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackovic </PERSON>, president of the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee, that federal regulators can not be sure they got the best deal in the rescue of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, because regulators had negotiated exclusively since April with the investors who were eventually chosen to take over American. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> announced Sept. 5 that they were providing $ 2 billion in government assistance to the <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to acquire American, the largest insolvent S & amp; L in the nation. Bass, in its first venture into the savings industry, is putting up $ 550 million. First Nationwide, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had unsuccessfully tried through most of 1987 and early this year to close a deal with the bank board. As the government's negotiations with <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> continued, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> failed in attempts to get back in the running. `` First Nationwide can not help but be disappointed in the outcome of negotiations. Had we been given the opportunity to remain in the bidding, the outcome may have been the same, but the uncertainty as to whether the government indeed had accepted the best bid would have been eliminated,'' <PERSON> Lackovic </PERSON> told the subcommittee chaired by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lackovic </PERSON> also criticized a provision of the Bass deal which permits the investment group to use $ 1.5 billion of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s resources for a merchant bank to invest in corporate takeovers and other ventures not traditional for savings `` We do not believe that -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' -RRB- intent was to permit ... a merchant bank to use low-cost funds from savings and loan institutions,'' he said. `` ... In many instances, the troubled thrifts are the ones that deviated widely from their traditional role and have engaged in highly risky investments.'' <PERSON> Lackovic </PERSON> questioned the wisdom of the government in retaining about a 30 percent ownership interest in the new American. `` Can the board apply the same standards to thrifts in which it owns a significant share, versus a competitor it regulates that is owned by private sector shareholders?'' he asked. Also, alluding to Bass' lack of experience in the savings field, <PERSON> Lackovic </PERSON> said, `` It is vital that the bank board work with ... companies that have demonstrated long-term commitments to the savings and loan industry.'' <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, chairman of the bank board, has defended the Bass deal, arguing that the $ 1.5 billion is a relatively small piece of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and that a merchant bank was worth trying. He also has said that maintaining and ownership interest in a rescued institution gives the government a chance to recoup some of its investments. And, he has said it is important to bring outside capital into the savings industry.

 Thousands of documents relating to the slayings of 29 black children in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> must be returned to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, a judge has ruled. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> instructed city officials to return files containing 2,300 documents related to the investigation of the killings in 1979-81.

<TEXT>
 The richest treasury of archeological artifacts ever found in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> has been discovered in the 1,500-year-old tomb of a warrior-leader of a civilization that once dominated <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday. The tomb, containing the remains of a man who apparently was a major chief of the Moche people, was excavated by Peruvian archeologists who were tipped to the site by grave robbers. `` It is truly the richest-ever find archeologically in the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> professor who has spent his career studying the Moche people. `` This should greatly accelerate the reconstruction of one of the greatest of the American civilizations.'' The year-long excavation of the tomb was conducted by a team of Peruvian archeologists led by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bruning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambayeque </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The work was funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. At a news conference Tuesday, <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said through a translator that the tomb was discovered after gold and silver artifacts began turning up on the black market in January, 1987. Some of the artifacts were confiscated by the customs office in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he said. Police in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> raided the home of a suspected grave robber, resulting in a shootout that killed one, said <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>. Artifacts recovered from the home were traced to a site near the village of <LOCATION> Sipan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said the area, adjacent to two eroding adobe pyramids, appears to contain up to 10 tombs of Moche leaders. He said there are plans to excavate them all. The Moche people, said <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>, created a civilization skilled in metal work and agriculture. He said they built a complex irrigation system that enabled them to establish an advanced society on the dry coastal plains of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> starting in about 100 A.D. The civilization lasted about 1,000 years, he said, and eventually was supplanted by the <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Incas </ORGANIZATION>, in turn, were conquered by the Spanish in the 1530s. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said the tomb that has been excavated contains the remains of a `` warrior-priest'' encased in a wooden coffin and surrounded by thousands of articles made of gold, silver, precious stone, and ceramic. He said the man was about 40 and was at or near the pinnacle of power in the Moche civilization during his lifetime. Decay of the bones made it impossible to determine the cause of death, he said, but there was no evidence of violence. Also in the tomb, said <PERSON> Alva </PERSON>, are up to eight other human remains, plus those of a dog and two llamas. It appears, he said, that the servants and wives of the Moche leaders were sacrificed and buried with them. One of the skeletons was found above the others, apparently placed there, <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said, as a `` guardian.'' The skeleton is that of a young warrior. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said both feet of the guardian had been amputated, apparently in the belief that it would keep the young warrior from fleeing his assignment to guard his leader in death. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said excavation of the site began under armed guard because many of the people living in nearby villages regarded the official archeologists as grave robbers. Now, he said, there is a growing understanding that artifacts in the tomb `` are treasures that belong to the all the Peruvian people.'' Many of the art works discovered, including a crown, a knife, a mask and strands of beads, are made of gold. One strand of gold beads is fashioned to resemble unshelled peanuts. One bead is about the size of a human palm and is made of 22 karat gold, <PERSON> Donnan </PERSON> said. The bead, which is a sculpted human head, had eyes made of silver and eye pupils made of precious stone. It was shown at the news conference while two armed guards stood nearby. The tomb also contained more than 1,000 pots, bowls, beakers and jars, along with articles made of copper. <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> said his team now is excavating another tomb in the <LOCATION> Sipan </LOCATION> area.

<HEAD>Pentagon Cuts Length of Panama Duty Tours</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has ordered a cut in the required tour length for all military personnel stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> as part of an effort to reduce the number of dependents in the troubled Central American nation, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the department's chief spokesman, said the policy change would reduce from 36 months to 30 months the required tour for servicemen accompanied by their families and drop from 24 months to 15 months the tour for those deploying alone. The latter reduction is considered the most important. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> explained the department also is enforcing a change to its `` concurrent travel'' policy, under which servicemen can not bring their families to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> unless they have already secured housing on a military reservation. Since there is currently a waiting period of up to nine months for such housing, `` the new tour length should encourage more soldiers just to go unaccompanied,'' added Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is the home of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, the organization responsible for all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. About 10,000 American servicemen are stationed permanently in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, and about 2,200 others have been assigned there on a temporary basis since the spring to upgrade security at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. According to <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, the decision to reduce the tour lengths was made initially last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, gaining the approval of Gen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vuono </PERSON>, the chief of staff, and <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> then reviewed the matter and ordered similar changes for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which have much smaller contingents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Over the past six months, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> has succeeded in reducing by 50 percent the number of military families living outside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> _ dropping the total still off base to about 1,100. The effort has taken on more momentum this summer because of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> describes as a deliberate campaign of harassing Americans assigned to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said on Aug. 21 that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> personnel had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by Panamanian authorities this year, including attempts to extort bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail. The harassment comes at a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is continuing to press economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in a bid to oust the country's military leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on drug-trafficking charges.

<TEXT>
 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' national security credentials today and joked that the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee `` lost his top naval adviser last week _ his rubber duck drowned in his bathtub.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of lacking knowledge of defense and foreign policy matters even as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate delivered a major policy speech in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Soviet-American relations. `` It's sad for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to have somebody that does n't have the understanding or qualifications in national security to be the Democratic nominee for president,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told an audience at <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> campaign headquarters for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. He said he had `` a sad story'' to tell about the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. `` The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he lost his top naval adviser last week,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` His rubber duck drowned in his bathtub.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> responded, `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s trying to call attention to his age. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is 41. On Monday, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> blasted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' economic program, telling a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> audience that the Democratic candidate's heart `` may be in the right place but his hand'll be back in your pocket'' with higher taxes and government spending if he is elected in November. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would end the economic expansion of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and `` return us once again to those chilling days of no-growth'' under <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asserted at a speech in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and in campaign stops aimed at blue-collar workers and their employers. The Republican vice presidential candidate travels to <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.D. </LOCATION>, today and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> as he continues this week's swing through the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and West. The trip began with a tour of an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> plant in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, a city of about 100,000 that has weathered tough economic times during the decade. About half of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>' 75 workers have participated in training programs through the Job Training Partnership Act, which <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> helped write. The 1982 federal law encourages businesses to train disadvantaged or dislocated workers and place them in local jobs. In remarks to business leaders at the <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> sounded the `` good jobs, good wages'' theme that has become a standard part of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speeches. He said stagnation and `` unguided'' economic policies had been the result of `` the last liberal state governor we plucked from relative obscurity and put in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'' _ a reference to <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. But during the Republican administration, 17 million new jobs were created, 12 million of them in occupations with wages averaging more than $ 20,000 a year, including 5.5 million with wages averaging closer to $ 30,000, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` They're good jobs at good wages and that's a record to be proud of,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. The message for those who have not yet `` made it'' because of past disadvantage or discrimination, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, is that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> still can be `` the land of opportunity in which free men and women can prosper through their own efforts and their own hard work.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also toured a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> plant which makes heavy equipment for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons systems. He drew cheers from the workers when he got behind the controls of a giant forklift and told the crowd, `` I want my union card.'' When someone shouted that he would have to pay his dues, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, whose campaign has been beset by a series of highly publicized controversies over his military service and academic record, shot back: `` I've paid some dues over these last few weeks.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also responded later to comments by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who said Monday that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` answer to drug kingpins like -LRB- <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>.'' `` The governor obviously does n't know what he's talking about,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters. `` We've conducted a very vigorous war on drugs ... Quite frankly, contrary to the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, who obviously does n't believe that tough law enforcement provides a deterrence, we do.''

 Three of the most prominent anti-apartheid activists detained under state-of-emergency regulations escaped from a hospital today and took refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate. The three men have requested a meeting with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>. Two of the men are senior officials of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> _ publicity secretary <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, a black, and acting general secretary <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, an Indian. The other is <PERSON> Vusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, a black who was chairman of the banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> issued a statement confirming that the three had taken refuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of an office building in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. `` We were in frequent contact with these three men prior to their detention without charge and hold them in high regard,'' the statement said. `` We will not press them to leave against their will.'' The statement said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not offer asylum at its diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolable under international law and may not be entered by the host government without consent. The embassy said it was discussing the situation with the activists and the South African government. Brig. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Law and <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed the incident and said the men escaped from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where they had been receiving physiotherapy. No details of the escape were disclosed. Previously, the three had been at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s Diepkloof Prison. At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security force deployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about two dozen journalists waited in the hall. <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION>, 32, and <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, 34, were detained in July 1987 after working clandestinely for the front since a state of emergency was declared June 12, 1986. <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, 37, was detained in December 1986. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for varying periods during the state of emergency. The government has not released comprehensive statistics, but it said recently that 802 people who had been held at least 30 days were still in custody. Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide coalition of more than 600 anti-apartheid groups. Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of parent, teacher and student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum and policies in their schools. The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts that spread nationwide in 1985-86, but the government outlawed its subsequent campaign for `` people's education.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the crisis committee were among 17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conducting any activities. Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Six front leaders stayed at the British Consulate in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> for several weeks in late 1984 before emerging to face arrest for high treason. The charges later were withdrawn. In September 1987, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to let a Dutchman, <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonge </PERSON>, return to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> after being holed up at a <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> for two years. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonge </PERSON> escaped into the office from police custody after being arrested for aiding the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 A large boulder tumbled onto a roadway after a thunderstorm and sheared off the front of a Greyhound bus, killing five people and injuring 14, authorities said. `` I felt an impact ... a big concussion and -LRB- what sounded like -RRB- a loud explosion, kind of deafening,'' said <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, one of two passengers who escaped injury. `` All of a sudden, I felt debris coming at us. A bright light flashed, like sparks and electricity in the front end of the bus.'' The bus, bound from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> with 20 passengers and a driver aboard, was struck on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Highway 68 late Monday, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lupita </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrion </PERSON>. The accident occurred in a mountainous area about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, where the highway parallels the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embudo </LOCATION> near the point where that river meets the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. The driver and four passengers died, and 14 passengers were injured, Ms. <PERSON> Carrion </PERSON> said. Four of the injured passengers were admitted to hospitals; their injuries were not described as life-threatening. <PERSON> Satwant </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalsa </PERSON>, deputy state medical investigator, said all five of the dead were adults. Although positive identification remains incomplete, he said one of the victims was from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and another was from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Hospital officials said six of the injured were children under 10 years old. Greyhound spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> identified the driver as <PERSON> Gaylon </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, who had been with the company exactly seven years Monday. A large rock tumbled from the mountain as the bus approached, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Officer <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuni </PERSON>. `` It sheared the front end of the bus off,'' <PERSON> Zuni </PERSON> said, describing the boulder as `` about as big as the front end of a car.'' At the site of the crash, the highway is flanked on the left by a sheer cliff and on the right by a bank that drops off about 40 feet into the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. Witnesses said the impact of the boulder pushed the bus into some rocks that had fallen at the right side of the road, keeping the bus from plunging into the river. The driver apparently was killed instantly. The Rev. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> McComb </PERSON>, a fire department volunteer, said that if the bus had gone off the road 10 feet sooner, it would have tumbled into the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>. `` There would n't have been anything left of this bus,'' he said. The area had been hit by a powerful thunderstorm just a few hours before the accident, and state Police Officer T.R. <PERSON> Rodella </PERSON> said the rain may have triggered the fall of rocks. It was initially feared that some of the passengers may have been thrown into the river, but O.R. <PERSON> Mascarenas </PERSON> of a search and rescue team said all 21 people aboard had apparently been accounted for. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a Mormon missionary from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said that after the impact, `` I immediately went down, put my head against the seat ahead of us, and my companion did the same. And we came to a really abrupt halt -LRB- in the rocks -RRB-.'' `` I do feel lucky,'' he said. `` All we heard were screams,'' said passenger <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, 20, another Mormon missionary who was on his way to <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> to take up a post there. One of the injured passengers, <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Albuquerque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> that after the impact he hit the floor while others were thrown around the bus. He said he saw a crying infant trapped beneath some seats; the child's mother, who appeared to be dead, was nearby. `` Children were crying, people were crying, people were lying down,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. He said he and another man freed the infant and then began helping other passengers from the bus because they feared an explosion. `` I feel fortunate,'' he said. `` I did n't even feel the pain until afterwards. ... I was just concerned for that woman and her baby.'' <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the driver was `` taking it easy,'' going only 45 or 55 mph, when the crash occurred. The 14 injured were taken to the emergency room of <LOCATION> Espanola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, nearly 20 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Embudo </LOCATION>, said hospital administrator <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. He said four people were admitted, two of whom were later transferred to another hospital, and 10 were treated for lesser injuries and released. <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, district sales manager for Greyhound in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, who was at the scene, said the company is cooperating with the police and rescue investigation but declined to comment further.

With an unemployment rate of just 2.3 percent in July, and just 6,900 of its workers lacking jobs, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> replaced <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> as the state with the lowest joblessness, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, whose jobless rate climbed from 2 percent in June to 2.5 percent in July, had been leading the nation with the lowest unemployment since last October. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose from 3.4 percent in June to 3.6 percent in July. It was a full percentage point higher that the same month a year ago, when it held the title as the state with the lowest joblessness. The number of jobless in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> climbed by more than 25,000 to 155,600 over the year, despite the addition of nearly 60,000 new jobs in the state, according to the <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> data. Following <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> with the lowest unemployment rates in July were <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> at 3.1 percent each, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> at 3.2 percent each, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> at 3.3 percent, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> at 3.4 percent and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> at 3.5 percent. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> continued to be the only state with double-digit joblessness, 10.2 percent in July, down from 10.6 percent a month earlier. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> all had unemployment rates above 8 percent compared with a nationwide jobless rate of 5.5 percent for the month, the bureau said. All of the figures are unadjusted for seasonal variations. While the jobless rate nationwide declined 0.6 percentage point over the year, it dropped much more dramatically in several states. <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> all saw their unemployment rates drop by more than 2 full percentage points in the 12 months. Unemployment rates over the year rose in only three states: <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. States with the largest job growth over the year were <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, up 6.1 percent; <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, up 5 percent; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, both up 4.7 percent, and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, up 4.4 percent. The bureau said service type employment increased in virtually all of the states while 80 percent of them also showed gains in manufacturing, transportation, trade and government jobs. Cities with the lowest jobless rate in the country were <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, at 1.8 percent and <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, at 2 percent. <LOCATION> Flint </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, had the highest unemployment rate at 14.9 percent followed by the McAllen-Edinburg-Mission area of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at 14.8 percent.

<HEAD>Israeli Peace Crusader Meets With Arafat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Israeli peace crusader <PERSON> Abie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> could be criminally prosecuted for holding talks with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and offering a peace plan that calls for mutual recognition, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The meeting prompted a political storm in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Right-wing legislators said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> should to be tried for treason, but left-wing politicians praised the meeting as an important step toward ending the 9-month-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the occupied lands. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> recently met with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> and presented the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader with a peace plan that includes mutual recognition between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> agreement to a 100-day moratorium on violence, and an end to the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>'s plan also calls for the release of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers missing or captured in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in exchange for the Israeli release of thousands of Palestinians detained since the uprising began Dec. 8, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. According to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, more than 260 Palestinians have been killed in the uprising and five Israelis also have died. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> promised to consider the peace proposals after he meets Tuesday with socialist members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> radio station in 1973, could face prosecution and a prison sentence of up to three years for his visit with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> leader. The meeting violates a 1986 Israeli law barring unauthorized contacts with members of terrorist groups. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> views the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as a terrorist group. Four Israeli leftists are serving six-month prison terms for meeting with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> hopes to brief Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> on his encounter with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief when he returns to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. Both <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, who favors an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference, and <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who opposes such a forum, have staunchly refused to include the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in peace negotiations. Right-wing legislator <PERSON> Yuval </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> demanded that <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> be arrested on his return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for illegally meeting with an enemy, the radio said. But two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> left-wing parties _ Mapam and the Progressive List for Peace _ praised <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> for making an important step toward peace. Left-wing legislator <PERSON> Yair </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaban </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> was an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> `` patriot'' and urged the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>'s radio station beams mostly rock music programs from a ship anchored outside <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. In its heyday a decade ago, the so-called Peace Ship dodged bullets to broadcast peace messages from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. Two years later, the vessel delivered 100,000 flowers to the people of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> as a gesture of peace.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> died a bum, a homeless 39-year-old man shot in the head after arguing over a bottle of vodka under a downtown bridge. Relatives say life had mostly been downhill for T'Souvas in the nearly two decades since he was charged with killing two Vietnamese children in what came to be known as the My Lai massacre. `` He had problems with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> over and over. He did n't talk about it much. But he had problems with the body counts, things like that,'' said his father, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` He lasted 20 years, but he was walking a tight line,'' the elder <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> said. Army Spec. 4 T'Souvas, then 19 and a high school dropout in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, was a member of one of three platoons that entered the village of My <LOCATION> Lai </LOCATION> on March 16, 1968, looking for <ORGANIZATION> Viet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cong </ORGANIZATION> troops but finding civilians instead. The platoon moved into My Lai, firing on fleeing Vietnamese, tossing grenades into houses and slaughtering animals. When the soldiers left, at least 175 men, women and children were dead, according to a 1970 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> report, although later investigations put the toll as high as 500. The Army charged T'Souvas with premediated murder of two unidentified Vietnamese with a machine gun. He was one of nine enlisted men charged. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the attorney who represented T'Souvas in the 1970 Army hearing, gave this account Monday: `` On the way out -LRB- of the village -RRB- T'Souvas saw two small children lying in the road with their intestines hanging out. In an emotional reaction, he took his M-16 and killed both to put them out of their misery.'' Lt. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was convicted of killing at least 22 civilians at My Lai. Of the enlisted men, two soldiers were acquitted and the charges against <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> and the six others were dropped. All were given honorable discharges. <PERSON> Calley </PERSON> was ordered to spend life in prison, but President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> later reduced his sentence to 20 years. He actually served three years under house arrest at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benning </LOCATION>, Ga. He was released when his conviction was overturned by a federal district judge, and he was not returned to house arrest when an appeals court reinstated the conviction. Relatives of <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> said that while he awaited the court-martial at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McPherson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, he lived in an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> commune, where he met and married a woman named <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>. Both later spent time in jail on marijuana charges before they moved to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, they said. They raised two children and <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> worked in a bakery and at various other jobs before their marriage broke up, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON>, an aunt. About four years ago, he met a carnival worker, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON>, now 36, the woman <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> police have charged with shooting him. Even though <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> never divorced, family members said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> assumed his last name. `` She was more like a buddy than a wife, a drinking buddy,'' his father said. `` She did nothing but drag him down,'' his aunt said. `` Everybody tried to warn him. She drank nothing but straight vodka and she did n't care if she had a roof over her head or shoes on her feet as long as she had her vodka. I saw her fight him over a drink several times.'' Police said the couple left <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in August 1987, criss-crossing the country in a van for several months before arriving in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where T'Souvas hoped to get a construction job. Police said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON>'s diary showed they lived in the van, often parking it near Three Rivers Stadium, as they fished in the rivers, sold their blood for money and worked part-time in a food kitchen for the homeless. After the van broke down they built a makeshift shelter on the banks of the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, according to police. On Sept. 3, police said, the couple and a homeless man, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON>, 42, spent the day drinking, fishing and using <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON>'s .22 - caliber pistol to shoot rats and cans under While <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> was gone to get food, police said, the couple argued over a bottle of vodka T'Souvas had. Police said the woman took <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON>'s gun and shot T'Souvas once in the head. <PERSON> Bozic </PERSON> said he did n't realize <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> was dead until the next morning, when the woman said she could n't rouse him, authorities said. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> was charged with criminal homicide and was being held without bail at the <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. A coroner's hearing is scheduled Thursday <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T'Souvas </PERSON> said he talked to his son a few days before his death. `` I just tried to tell him to put it together and come home,'' the father said. `` I sent him some money, but he never came.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aircraft and vessels today searched for a crewman missing from an F-14 jet fighter that plunged into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> while practicing combat maneuvers, killing his crewmate, officials said. Six people were injured in another F-14 crash Monday after two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> aviators bailed out of their jet over an airfield in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION>, sending it smashing into a hangar. And a pilot in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> escaped injury today in a third military training flight in two days. The crash off <LOCATION> Hatteras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, occurred Monday afternoon 22 miles east of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. A fishing boat picked up a crewman, who was pronounced dead. The identity of the dead aviator and his missing crewmate were not released pending notification of relatives. Five people, including the two <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fliers, remained hospitalized today following the crash Monday morning in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION> 15 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The $ 35 million jet crashed upside down into hangars at <LOCATION> Gillespie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> and exploded. The blaze ignited by the crash destroyed a hangar and an attached extension, but spared a nearby restaurant. Authorities said the two crewman tried to guide the jet to the runway at <LOCATION> Gillespie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> before bailing out. Capt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, commanding officer of <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miramar </ORGANIZATION>, said he was grateful there were n't more injuries, `` particularly when you're this close to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cajon </LOCATION>. It's a very populated area.'' The jet passed within a mile of an elementary school. `` I thought they were just doing tricks. And then we saw the parachutes,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moscuso </LOCATION>, a sixth-grader at <ORGANIZATION> Ballantyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. In the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> accident, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> air force in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said the plane was engaged in mock dogfights with another F-14 and an A-4 jet in restricted military airspace off the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast. `` It was flying a routine training mission,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. The cause of the crash was not determined, officials said. The aircraft sank soon after impact, <PERSON> John </PERSON> said. The twin-engine supersonic fighter was attached to <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 143 </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Oceana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. In northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> today, an F-16A jet fighter crashed west of <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> after the pilot bailed out, a base spokeswoman said.

Spokeswoman <PERSON> Silvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Mons-Liddle </PERSON> said the plane went down about 25 miles west of the base about 9:05 a.m. MDT.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Housing Bias Legislation, Lauds King</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Tuesday putting new enforcement teeth in the open-housing law <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed in the wake of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'s 1968 assassination. Standing with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the White House Rose Garden, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hailed the newly enacted bill as `` the most important civil rights legislation in 20 years.'' Singling out Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga., who had accompanied King to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the civil rights leader's `` I Have a Dream'' speech in 1963, the president said the legislation `` has brought us one step closer to realizing <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s dream. The measure, which was passed overwhelmingly by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, extends anti-discrimination protections to the handicapped and to families with children. It also empowers the federal government _ for the first time _ to seek fines of up to $ 100,000 against individuals or organizations found to have engaged in a pattern of housing discrimination. Under the open-housing provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the government was given only a mediating role in housing discrimination disputes. `` Discrimination is particularly tragic when it means a family is refused housing near good schools, a good job or simply in a better neighborhood to raise children,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` This bill is the product of years of bipartisan work, and repairs a significant ... defect in civil rights law.'' He said that while the 1968 law was well-intentioned, `` it lacked teeth. Its concilation provisions were ineffective when used.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that he and Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> had `` devoted eight years'' to seeking improvements in the 1968 law, `` to redress the absence of penalties and the inability of the government to initiate actions except when ` a pattern of dsicrimination' could be proven.'' Under the bill he signed Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> will have authority to initiate enforcement actions and to seek penalties against individuals, businesses or organizations that discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex or national origin in the sale, rental or financing of housing. It authorizes civil penalties, which could be recommended following an agency administrative enforcement process, of up to $ 10,000 or a first offense, $ 25,000 for a second and up to $ 50,000 for a third. In instances where a pattern of discrimination has been alleged, the government could seek up to $ 50,000 for a first offense and as much as $ 100,000 for subsequent offenses. Besides strengthening existing provisions in law dealing with racial discrimination, the measure protects the handicapped against housing bias. For instance, a landlord could be considered to be in violation if he refused to make reasonable modifications in premises to accommodate the handicapped. Under the section protecting families with children from discrimination in the sale, rental or financing of housing, buildings that are now `` adult only'' could exclude children only if the managers or owners of these structures adopted a policy to rent or sell to the elderly only. Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., who took part in the ceremony, said that `` today, there is wide agreement after nearly two decades of experience that the Fair Housing Act has not been invested with adequate enforcement remedies ... Today, we give the law the tools needed to make its promise a reality for all of our families.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used the occasion to throw a bouquet in the direction of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was out on the campaign trail as the Republican presidential nominee. `` The Civil Rights Act of 1968 included for the first time in our history a fair housing provision. That was a major achievement, one that many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ including a young congressman named <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ had to show enormous courage to vote for,'' the president said. And then he called people's attention to the presence on the platform of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who was among the many young blacks who joined King in the civil rights leader's battles of the 1950s and'60s. `` Twenty-five years ago, as a young leader of the civil rights movement, Congressman <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> was standing in this very Rose Garden pressing for federal action to eliminate housing discrimination,'' he said. `` To all of you and to everyone involved in the passage of this legislation, the nation says thank you.''

<HEAD>Compelling Evidence Iraq Used Chemical Weapons, Shultz Says</HEAD>

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` compelling'' evidence that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used chemical weapons against its Kurdish citizens. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should conduct its own probe before being asked to condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for alleged genocide. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said, however, that an immediate <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> session is imperative to make the case against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> contended that it is important that the world body investigate the facts independently. `` Not everybody agrees with what we say the facts are,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the committee. He added that the government of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has said it can find no evidence among the Kurdish refugees fleeing from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> that chemical weapons were used against them. `` What you want is for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to form a team and go an see what the facts are,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> commented as senator after senator said the evidence the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> possesses appears to be solid and should be presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> now, to bring into focus the question of whether <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is subjecting its Kurdish minority to a deliberate campaign of genocide. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reached the conclusion <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is using chemical weapons against the Kurds based on its own examination of Kurdish refugees inside <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and on `` other evidence which to me seems to be compelling.'' `` I feel our evidence is quite convincing ...,'' he said. `` But we're not in a position to make that public.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> noted that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> conducted an earlier investigation into accusations that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had used chemical weapons in its war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and concluded such weapons were in fact used.

 Confessed <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> proudly pointed out the blood of a slain <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage and indicated he was happy the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was dead, an American witness testified Tuesday. Flight engineer <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> described how he and <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> walked around the front of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> aircraft in <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> in June 1985, and <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> showed him the blood left by the shooting death of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> joyfully pointed to the blood running down the door. And with the pistol he pointed, he indicated, he was very proud of this gun and of him having caused this,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> told the court. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, was shot to death during the June 1985 hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847. His body was thrown onto the runway in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> before the plane went to <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. In previous testimony, Flight 847 pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> identified <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> as <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s killer <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, is on trial on air piracy and murder charges. He has admitted to the court that he was one of the two hijackers, but he denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, was the only witness Tuesday. He was the flight engineer aboard the Athens-to-Rome flight when it was hijacked to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on June 14, 1985. He said he was kicked and pistol-whipped during the ordeal. The Arab hijackers held 39 Americans hostage for 17 days. During the hijacking, the jet flew to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, then to <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, then back to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. As Tuesday's court session began, Chief Judge <PERSON> Hainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> welcomed the release of West German hostage <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was freed Monday after 20 months of captivity. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another West German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, were kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 soon <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with explosives in his luggage. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s older brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was convicted by a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court of helping kidnap <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> in a bid to free his brother. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON> was released Sept. 7, 1987 in what his kidnappers said was a `` good will gesture.'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' captors referred to the <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> trial when they freed <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> on Monday. In a note issued in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the kidnappers said if <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s freedom ca n't be gained legally they will again resort to violence. `` This happy news means an end to endless speculation about what influence <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' captivity might have had on these proceedings,'' judge <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> said Tuesday, adding that `` outside elements'' had never influenced the court. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said he was stunned by <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s behavior in pointing out the blood. `` I wondered how he expected me to respond to him. It was as if he wanted congratulations. It seemed to be a great moment to him, what that blood represented to him,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said. When asked by the judge if he wished to comment on the testimony, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said: `` There is a lot of conflicting testimony, but I have nothing to say.'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said the hijackers beat him and other passengers during the ordeal. `` I would be hit on the side of the head with the gun butt. When I would bend forward the blows would go down my back,'' he told the court. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> described the events that led up to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s death. He said that when negotiations for fuel with the tower in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> went too slowly, <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> shouted `` Get up! Get up!'' to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. By that time, according to other testimony, <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> had been severely beaten by the two hijackers. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said the hijackers then left the cockpit. `` I heard a pop. I heard someone exhale very loudly. I heard it above the engine noises. The shock of that noise was added to by the co-pilot on the radio stating that we needed fuel because they were killing passengers,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> told the court. He added in later testimony that he did not know which of the hijackers had the pistol just before the sailor was shot. `` They exchanged the pistol frequently so it was hard to determine who had it when,'' <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, echoing earlier testimony from the plane's captain, said the hijackers seemed well-trained and familiar with the aircraft. `` Someone had taught them about the airplane. They knew where the crash axe should have been stored,'' said <PERSON> Zimmermann </PERSON>, who added that he hid the ax after realizing that the plane was being commandeered. <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> testified Monday that he believed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> because <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> seemed to enjoy inflicting violence on the passengers and crew.

 Salvadoran presidential candidate <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> said Tuesday the Nicaraguan government continues to support the leftist guerrilla movement in his homeland. <PERSON> Chevez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, candidate of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, said the insurgents nonetheless are a far less potent force than they were earlier in the decade. While giving no specifics, <PERSON> Chevez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> said the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> `` continues to give support in one way or another'' to the rebels and `` have not concealed their sympathy'' for the insurgents' program. <PERSON> Chevez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, a former foreign minister and planning minister, told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have shown no inclination to abide by the provisions of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace plan they signed last year. `` I have to regret how <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, instead of making their process more flexible, becomes more radical every day,'' he said. He said the peace accord signed by the region's five presidents `` deligitimized'' the rebel forces because it confirmed the need for democratic solutions to the region's problems. One measure of how much the insurgent threat has been reduced, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> said, is that he can travel almost anywhere in the country `` practically without risk.'' <PERSON> Chevez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> expressed confidence that he and his party will prevail in presidential elections next March. In contrast to other contenders, including the rightist ARENA party, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON> said he represents the `` great center'' of the Salvadoran political spectrum that reflects the sentiments of most of his countrymen. He said the ARENA victory in legislative elections last March was a `` punishment vote'' against the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, based on the party's inability to move quickly enough to solve economic and social problems. He acknowledged that unemployment and other social problems remain acute but said the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> people will take the vote for president next year more seriously and will give the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> another five-year term in office.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill Protecting Aviation Workers Who Report Safety
Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation Tuesday barring airlines, aircraft manufacturers and other aviation companies from retaliating against employees who complain to the government about safety problems. The measure prohibits employers from firing or taking other actions against workers who notify government agencies about what they believe are safety problems, or who refuse to allow an aircraft to operate because they believe a hazardous condition exists. The bill, passed on a voice vote, gained momentum this year after lawmakers heard from workers, including pilots and other employees of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, who complained that pressure was placed by management on those who object to safety problems. `` It is imperative employees feel they can come to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> or to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with their safety concerns so the traveling public can be protected,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The bill's future is uncertain because there is no similar <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version. There is a much broader <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure that would protect all private-sector whistleblowers, including aviation industry workers, but that bill seems unlikely to pass this year. The House bill would allow workers to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> if they believe they have lost their jobs or been punished because they complained about safety problems. A party dissatisfied with the labor secretary's decision could appeal to an administrative law judge within the department, and ultimately to the courts. If a worker is found to have brought his complaint in bad faith, the employee can be held liable for the company's legal fees, up to $ 5,000.

For several months, the two candidates for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidential election have been perched at the two ends of a see-saw, rising and falling with the polls, while the commentators flock alternatively in one direction or the other, amplifying these movements to an extreme with a surprising unanimity. ... `` There is really no reason for this game of teeter-totter to stop. The voters seem to be looking with a gloomy and sceptical eye at these two candidates scrambling to seduce them, who both present themselves as representatives of the fair middle, the ` main stream' of opinion, but who are scarcely successful in attracting that opinion; two men who, failing to convince by their own qualities, apply themselves, not without success, to denouncing the faults of their rival and throwing low blows The seesaw is likely to stay in movement, with more and more grating.''

Calling any future Palestinian state a ` threat' to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is also unwarranted. How can a truncated and demilitarized state pose a threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a country with nuclear capabilities? `` By insinuating that such a state would also threaten the security and stability of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went beyond the realm of reality. ... `` Gov. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sadly attempted to outbid Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in support of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. For by asserting that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will never accept a solution to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, no matter how just and legitimate, if it is rejected by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has permanently mortgaged his country's national interests to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.... `` It is sad to see would-be statesmen so lose sight of all long-term interests, their own included, in the short-term hunt for votes.

 Children and monks joined thousands of striking civil servants who marched through <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Tuesday to demand the government resign and be replaced by an interim administration to supervise multiparty elections. Opposition leaders told a new Parliament-appointed election commission that neither they nor the people will accept elections organized by the government. International telephone and telex lines from <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> were cut off Tuesday, but it was not known if they were deliberately disrupted, since communications with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> normally are poor. Residents of the capital were hoarding food and cutting down on rice consumption as transportation strikes pushed up the prices of essential items. About 75 people _ including two <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks _ began a two-day pro-democracy hunger strike outside city hall. On Monday, more than 1,000 children ending a 36-hour fast gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> shouting `` Give Us Democracy!'' and `` Give Us Interim Government!'' Tens of thousands of striking government workers, students, medical personnel, children and monks staged peaceful demonstrations in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> Tuesday against President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> and his ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition leaders <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and former Defense Minister Tin Oo told the election commission they rejected the government's promise to end 26 years of one-party rule and hold elections as early as late October. The three told the commission that polling could not be held amidst the country's political turmoil and violence, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said, and that they will not support or participate in elections organized by the government. In a letter to <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> on Monday, the opposition demanded an interim government. The three leaders also said it would be unfair to hold the elections before opposition groups form parties and raise funds to compete against ruling party candidates, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON> said he told election commission chairman <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Htay </PERSON>, a retired financial commissioner under a pre-1962 civilian government: `` I know you and I respect your integrity and I am confident you want to hold a free and fair election, but after 26 years of this rule, most people in the country do not know you and will not have confidence. More so, people do not trust any government-appointed commission.'' Like the other four elderly commission members, <PERSON> Ba </PERSON> <PERSON> Htay </PERSON> is regarded as politically neutral. In this city of 3.5 million, strikes by transportation workers and a lack of fuel have restricted food deliveries from the countryside. The resulting shortages and an increase in the price of staples such as rice have forced residents to eat porridge or gruel and to hoard food. A 4.4-pound bag of rice that cost $ 1.70 a month ago now costs $ 5.80, said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said gasoline was selling for $ 16 a gallon on the black market, compared to $ 1 a year ago. The last multiparty elections in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> were held Feb. 6, 1960, when former Prime Minister U Nu's <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Fascist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> won a landslide victory over an army-backed party Gen. Ne Win led the March 1962 coup that toppled U Nu. The military crushed dissent and pursued rigid policies that made <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, once one of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>'s richest countries, one of the world's poorest nations In September 1987, students staged riots against the government's economic policies, followed by widespread protests in March and in June. After Ne Win resigned July 23, the party chose hardliner <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> to succeed him. After only 17 days in office and massive anti-government protests, <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> was replaced on Aug. 19 by <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, the first civilian leader since U Nu.

 A federal judge has thrown out a $ 4 billion libel lawsuit brought by the inventor of the Nautilus exercise machine, who claimed he was defamed in a `` 20-20'' news program. Nothing in the episode damaged <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' reputation, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> said in a ruling last week. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said Tuesday from his ranch near <LOCATION> Ocala </LOCATION> that his attorney would appeal. `` I'm not happy with the judge's ruling ... in a case where we're patently right and they're patently wrong,'' he said. `` We'll take it clear to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if we have to. The broadcast concerned <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' attempts to save 63 baby West African elephants by flying them from <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> to his ranch. The elephants had been slated for slaughter to control the size of the herd. In 1984, `` 20-20'' broadcast a segment about <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' efforts to save the animals. In a March 1987 follow-up, the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> show revealed some elephants were being sold from <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' ranch. Reporter <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Caras </PERSON> said several elephants had gone to small circuses, `` a fate worse than death.'' In an on-air exchange with anchor <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, <PERSON> Caras </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> should have kept the elephants for good, as had been implied from the beginning. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was quoted as saying that he did not have control of the animals at the time they were being sold because he was selling business assets. But the company buying the assets told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> it was not responsible for selling the elephants. Two weeks after the segment aired, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> sued, saying the show deliberately made him seem dishonest and cruel. `` The court finds that a reasonable person would not have intrepreted the broadcast, in whole or in part, as being defamatory,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> wrote. She found that the statements in the broadcast were either constitutionally protected opinion or not damaging to <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' reputation.

<HEAD>Those Most Mentally Ill Get Worst Care, Groups Contend</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The most seriously mentally ill patients in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tend to get the worst treatment largely because so many good psychiatrists leave public hospitals to make more money in private practice, two advocacy groups contended Tuesday. `` The lack of adequate services for the seriously mentally ill is the major failure of American medicine and social services,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> for the Mentally Ill said in a report. Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, co-founder with <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION>, called for `` using the leverage of federal funding to force'' psychiatrists to devote a certain amount of time to working in public mental health facilities. At a news conference and in a subsequent interview, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said medical schools in general are more heavily subsidized by federal money than other professional schools and that psychiatric training is the most heavily subsidized of the medical specialities. `` It's almost impossible to get competent psychiatrists in public practice in some states,'' said <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrey </PERSON>, a psychiatrist and a co-author of the report. He said it would not be too much to require psychiatrists to devote four or five hours a month to public practice in return for having their education subsidized by tax money. The report itself said the failure to provide adequate care `` is particularly striking since we now know that the majority of these people can be successfully treated and rehabilitated.'' Expanding on a ranking system first used in 1986, a new survey by the groups concluded that <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> are the best at providing services. Lowest-rated in the survey were <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Torrey </PERSON> said being at the top of the list was not much to crow about. `` When most are giving third - and fourth-class care, states that are delivering second-class care look pretty good It's a little like being the smartest kid in the dumb class at school,'' he said The report said: `` In general, it can be said that hospital care for the seriously mentally ill in state mental hospitals is somewhat worse than it was two years ago, while outpatient services are modestly better. `` Rehabilitation services and housing for the seriously mentally ill remain on the best of days seriously deficient and on the worst of days abysmal,'' it said. `` The reasons for the general deterioration of hospital care center primarily on staffing deficiencies, especially in nursing and psychiatry,'' the report said. `` In both cases, the deficiencies are being exacerbated by the mushrooming of private psychiatric hospitals which are taking the best staff from the public sector with the lure of higher wages.'' It attributed marginal improvement in outpatient services `` to increased public attention to the sorry plight of the homeless mentally ill, an issue which has moved from the back alleys and grates of the city to the front pages of its newspapers.'' The report said conservative estimates suggest that nearly 2 million people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are seriously mentally ill, with 8 percent of them hospitalized. `` Approximately one-third of homeless individuals are seriously mentally ill,'' the report said. `` Their visibility on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s streets is a poignant reminder of the debacle of deinstitutionalization and failure of federally funded community mental health centers. <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> for the Mentally Ill, noted that her organization is made up of 70,000 families of people suffering from mental illness. `` For us the lack of services is a personal and family tragedy,'' she said. The overall state rankings were based on a composite figure drawn by awarding points ranging from zero to five in each of four categories: hospital care, outpatient services, rehabilitation and housing. The report relied on questionnaires to state mental health directors, various government surveys and visits to 35 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. The report said 82 percent of the state mental health directors returned nine-page questionnaires _ when guaranteed anonymity _ even though their national organization did not endorse the survey.

 Here are state-by-state rankings on the level of care provided for the seriously mentally ill as compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> for the Mentally Ill. The rankings were based on a composite figure drawn by assigning a zero to five-point value in each of four categories: hospital care, outpatient services, rehabilitation and housing. Data collection methods included questionnaires to state mental health directors and others, various government surveys and visits to 35 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. When states have an equal number of points, they were ranked according to per capita income, with poor states ranked higher on the assumption that, all other things being equal, wealthy states should do better than poorer states. The number in brackets is the 1986 ranking. The groups said inclusion of additional data in the 1988 figures could account for some changes in position rather than actual improvement or worsening of services.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, bowing to a veto threat and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s will, today retreated from its position that the federal Medicaid program should fund abortions for poor victims of rape and incest. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 47-43 to drop an amendment that would have liberalized the current policy of federal funds only when abortion is necessary to save a woman's life. In July, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 73-19 to expand Medicaid to pay for abortions in promptly reported cases of rape or incest. States would have had the option of retaining the current, more limited policy. The abortion controversy had been holding up a massive $ 140 billion spending bill meant to keep the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and Education in business during fiscal 1989, which starts Oct. 1. The bill contains money for college loans, disadvantaged children, job training and AIDS research and education, among other things. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has repeatedly said he would veto the entire Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill if it came to him with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> abortion provision. The latest threat came in a letter Sept. 7 to congressional leaders. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday refused 216-166 to go along with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> expansion. Three hours of often emotional debate preceded today's vote, with some senators decrying abortion and others maintaining that poor women in desperate circumstances deserve access to a legal medical option. `` The question is, is a child conceived by rape any less of a human being than one who is not?'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> `` One atrocity ... does n't justify another. Rape does n't justify murder.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, R-Conn., countered that it `` defies all common sense'' not to permit federal payments for `` the most narrow exceptions under the most extraordinary and dismal of circumstances. Fourteen states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> pay for Medicaid abortions, but only receive federal reimbursement for life-threatening cases. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote in July was the first time since 1981 that either chamber had approved more liberal eligibility.

 Here are major provisions of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed into law Tuesday: _ Protection against housing discrimination would cover the disabled and handicapped and families with children under age 18 Current law already protects against discrimination because of race, sex, religion or national origin. _ The secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> would try to win a conciliation agreement after a complaint if filed If that effort fails, the secretary or any party could take the case to an independent administrative law judge in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> or to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district court. _ If the administrative judge finds that someone has engaged or is about to engage in a discriminatory practice, he shall order appropriate relief, which may include actual damages, an injunction or civil penalties _ The maximum fines would be $ 10,000 for a first violation, $ 25,000 for a second violation within a five-year period and $ 50,000 for two or more violations within a seven-year period Civil penalties ranging from $ 10,000 for a first offense to $ 100,000 for succeeding offenses would be authorized in cases where a `` pattern or practice'' of discrimination has been proved. _ The administrative law judge's ruling would be subject to review by a federal appellate court _ A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judge could impose the added penalty of punitive damage _ New buildings with four or move units must be constructed so they are readily accessible to the handicapped Doors must be wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs; switches and outlets must be in accessible locations; bathroom walls must be reinforced to allow for installation of grab bars. This would apply to dwellings set for occupancy 30 months after the law's enactment. _ Disabled tenants would have the right to make reasonable modifications to a dwelling at their own expense The tenants would have to agree to restore the property to its original condition when they leave. _ Children could be barred from housing intended for the elderly, but that would be the only exception to an open-housing policy for those 18 and under Housing for the elderly is defined as a community where at least 80 percent of the dwellings are occupied by at least one person age 55 or older, and significant facilities and services are provided; or those occupied solely by people age 62 and older.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, trying to juggle a political hot potato, broke with tradition Tuesday by opening its session with recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the pledge, which has become an item of controversy in the presidential campaign, would be recited on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor at the beginning of each day's session until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns next month. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, also lashed out harshly at Republicans who have sought to make the pledge an issue, saying such efforts are `` childish, immature and mean-spirited as a person can be.'' Rep. G.V. `` Sonny'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., held his hand over his heart as he led about three dozen lawmakers in reciting the 31-word pledge <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>'s podium was turned sideways from its normal position so he could see the large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag that hangs behind the speaker's chair. The pledge was to be led on Wednesday by Rep. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, R-Calif., with Democrats and Republicans alternating days through the end of the session The members in the chamber Tuesday appeared to be roughly equally divided between the two parties. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., who brought the pledge squabble to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber last week, called it a historic moment and said he would press to make the recitation a daily fixture <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> promised that such a rules change would be considered through normal channels. `` I compliment the speaker for recognizing that the dignity and integrity of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would be enhanced by the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of each session day,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. The pledge has become the centerpiece of an argument, begun in the presidential campaign, over whether Democrats or Republicans are more patriotic. Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the fight by criticizing Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a bill in 1977 that would have penalized teachers for not leading the pledge in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> schools. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the governor, said he vetoed the bill because it was unconstitutional, and has labeled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attack a McCarthyite tactic. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> also repeated his belief that attempting to use the pledge as a political weapon `` is McCarthyism,'' a reference to the fervently anti-communist senator who impugned many Americans' patriotism in the 1950s The pledge, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, is like the daily prayer that opens <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sessions. `` It's a personal matter'' and members are `` free not to do so'' if they choose. `` I do n't think it's up to me to go around and see whose lips are moving,'' he said. Republicans appeared to delight last week when <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> surprised the chamber's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership and sought a sudden rules change to make the pledge permanent. The move was defeated on a 226-168 vote, largely along party lines. Without mentioning <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> today said `` the idea of trying to use the pledge as a wedge of division among Americans is what I regard as McCarthyism.'' He added: `` To suggest that another political party is less patriotic ... is childish, immature and mean-spirited as a person can be.'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> rose after the pledge was recited today to add that he agreed with <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> that it should `` not be confrontational.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> formally endorsed the pledge in a 1942 law, and the words `` under God'' were added in 1954 by a second law. But the 31-word sentence has not been a part of the chamber's own routine.

 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' national security credentials Tuesday with jokes about the Democratic nominee's `` rubber duck'' naval adviser and foreign policy dealings limited to his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> neighbors At a rally of several hundred supporters in <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` dangerously naive'' on national security and `` the most anti-defense candidate on a national level since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told backers in the <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Wauwatosa </LOCATION> it was `` shocking'' that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> found it necessary to receive defense briefings last weekend from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` He does n't know enough about national defense,'' said the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. `` He has to stop in and ask members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that I've been working with for the past 12 years.'' On a day when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delivered a major speech on U.S.-Soviet relations in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor does n't have `` the understanding or qualifications'' to run for president. `` Want to hear a sad story about the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign?'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> asked. `` The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he lost his top naval adviser last week. His rubber duck drowned in his bathtub,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said to roars of laughter from his audience at <ORGANIZATION> Bush-Quayle </ORGANIZATION> campaign headquarters for <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> responded in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s trying to call attention to his age.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is 41. Republican nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate then headed for <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> on a Western campaign swing that focused on jobs, economic prosperity and a strong defense. The Republicans have tried to portray <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as weak on defense and foreign policy issues, and have criticized his opposition to the MX and <LOCATION> Midgetman </LOCATION> nuclear missiles and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars plan for a space-based missile defense. `` You do n't learn what you need to know about the national security of our nation in one weekend cram course,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, referring to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' weekend meetings with Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> `` The closest thing he -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- has to foreign policy experience is dealing with the governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of having a `` midnight conversion'' on defense, presumably a reference to a recent, apparent softening in the governor's opposition to <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION>. `` He did n't just find religion. He found his poll numbers,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He noted that <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, national security adviser to former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, had endorsed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who named <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> on Monday to a 13-member panel of campaign advisers on national security. `` Dr. <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON> ... is willing to put his reputation, his integrity ... to support <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` The reason he made that decision is because he knows the governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. He knows what kind of a president he would be.''

 Voters chose candidates Tuesday to succeed retiring Sens. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, with moderate Republican Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> facing a conservative in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and former Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> battling a sports team owner in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. In other highlights of primary voting in six states, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was favored over two opponents for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination to succeed retiring Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. And in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, more than a dozen Republican legislators who voted to impeach or convict <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> last spring were challenged by candidates loyal to the ousted governor. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>, whose frequent opposition to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies angered fellow Republicans, faced newcomer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> primary Democrat <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney, had no primary opposition. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>'s retirement in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> after 31 years in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sparked spirited races in both parties. On the Democratic side, the latest newspaper polls showed <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bucks </ORGANIZATION> basketball team owner <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> leading a four-way race that included former Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> and Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, who had never before sought public office, spent nearly $ 2.1 million, much of it on TV ads, and drew criticism from his rivals that he was trying to buy the election. Republicans chose between state Sen. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, a moderate, and the more conservative <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. King, former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> state chairman. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, son of a former governor, faced former <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and political neophyte <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> for the Republican nomination for governor. The unopposed Democratic nominee was lawyer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McEachern </PERSON>, a foe of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant who narrowly lost to <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> in 1986. In <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s 2nd District, <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a former state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice, was locked in a bitter contest with former state Rep. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON> in a six-way GOP race. Primaries also were held in: _ <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, where Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> and Democratic Attorney General <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> `` Skip'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> were expected to breeze past primary challengers for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> nominations; _ <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where Democrats <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringham </PERSON> sought the nomination to oppose Republican Rep. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielson </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, a Republican, and <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, a Democrat, were among six senators _ three from each party _ to retire this year. Democrats now control the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a margin of 54 to 46. There was irony in the high-stakes campaign to succeed the 72-year-old <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, who had become famous for his low-budget campaigns and congressional budget-cutting efforts. In winning re-election 1982, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said he spent $ 145.10, some of it for postage to return contributions. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a former chain store owner, was by far the leader in spending, followed by $ 431,000 by <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, $ 360,000 by <PERSON> Garvey </PERSON> and $ 15,500 by <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Follette </ORGANIZATION>, as of Aug. 24, <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> records showed. In the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> race, <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 47, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and one-time chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, sought to pin a liberal tag on <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, 36, a veteran of 11 years the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s minority leader. King stressed his opposition to a tax increase and abortion and his support for the death penalty. Engleiter, who said she had the backing of a broader segment of the party, said she had spent much of her legislative career fighting against increased taxes. King criticized <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> for running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> when she has two small children at home. Motherhood also became an issue in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, where Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who endorsed <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, created an uproar last week when he said <PERSON> Tamposi </PERSON> should n't run because she has a 22-month-old daughter. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> apologized two days later. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> won endorsements from nationally known conservatives, including Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> called himself the real Republican in the race to succeed the 75-year-old <PERSON> Stafford </PERSON>, who served as governor and congressman before entering the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1971. <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON>' support of Democratic initiatives over the years angered many of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> faithful, including former four-term Gov. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snelling </PERSON>, who donated $ 1,000 to the <PERSON> Griffes </PERSON> campaign. In 1981, <PERSON> Jeffords </PERSON> was the sole House Republican to vote against <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tax-cut package; In 1987, he had the second-highest anti-Reagan voting record among Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as analyzed by <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> Quarterly magazine. He opposed the president on 71 percent of the key votes.

<HEAD>Cuba Blames Defector For London Shooting Incident</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday blamed a shadowy defector and British intelligence for an incident in which a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> pulled out a gun and fired shots at people he said were menacing him. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s ambassador, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez-Mell </PERSON>, and the Cuban embassy's third secretary, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, to leave the country Monday in the wake of the shooting. A statement by the the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> expelling the two Cubans said the government `` would not tolerate the use of firearms by diplomats.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> told police he fired because he was afraid for his safety. It said he was released from police custody after he claimed diplomatic immunity. Government-operated <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> blamed Cuban defector <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspillaga </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombard </PERSON> for the shooting, saying he tried to strong-arm <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> into defecting. In a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the radio station said <PERSON> Aspillaga </PERSON> defected from the Cuban embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, in June 1987 `` to put himself at the service of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Aspillaga </PERSON>, along with three men and a woman, approached <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> and tried to persuade him to defect, the government radio said. `` The traitor -LRB- <PERSON> Aspillaga </PERSON> -RRB- threatened <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> to make him desert,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Havana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. `` In response, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> drew the gun he was carrying and fired against the traitor, and the whole group ran away.'' The Cuban radio said `` it is absolutely impossible that a man totally in the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and under strict security measures could travel to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and carry on this type of action against a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat without the cooperation of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and British authorities.'' The radio called <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s expulsion `` deeply unfair and arbitary,'' saying it was aimed at hiding cooperation between British intelligence and the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> in the affair. Police said detectives had traced one man who was slightly injured in the shooting and were satisfied he `` was not posing a threat to anyone.'' <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yard </LOCATION> police headquarters said it would not release the man's identity, adding the police inquiry into the shooting was closed.

<HEAD>GOP Task Force Calls for Developing Hispanic Talent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Senate Republicans proposed a series of education, employment and health initiatives Tuesday aimed at ensuring that Hispanics `` have access to the opportunities and support systems'' already available to most Americans. But the Democratic chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said there was `` not really any substance to that report'' and that its findings were an `` election year-type of rhetoric.'' `` They need a primer on understanding the issues because they always vote wrong on the issues. I'm happy to see they've at least put a position out there,'' he said, calling the 1980s `` really and truly a disaster for Hispanics.'' But another Hispanic leader, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Martino </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, board chairman of the the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raza </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman, said the report dealt meaningfully with the issues affecting Hispanics, the nation's fastest-growing population group `` We have some very important people on this -LRB- task force -RRB-. This is a first. This is historic,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Martino </PERSON>, a member of the task force's bipartisan advisory committee. Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, chairman of the panel, said many of the recommendations could be accomplished with legislation, while the executive branch would be encouraged to take action with through executive orders. He said the task force had already backed efforts to provide $ 6 million to fund national and local Hispanic literacy programs. <PERSON> Bustamante </PERSON> challenged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republicans to do more, and back up their promises with discretionary funds for programs and minority contracts benefiting Hispanics. The report said education is the most critical issue in the Hispanic community. Unless literacy and dropout rates are turned around, it said, young Hispanics will not be able to find jobs as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> evolves from a manufacturing to a technology and service-based economy with greater needs for workers with higher skills. Studies show Hispanics are the least educated major population group in the country, the study said. The task force's recommendations include: _ Expanding national and local initiatives to reduce illiteracy and combat a high Hispanic student dropout rate _ Advocating programs at the federal, state and local levels and in the private sector that provide managerial skills assistance to small minority businesses _ Pursuing an aggressive trade policy with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to benefit businesses on both sides of the border _ Improving the recruitment of qualified Hispanics into managerial and professional positions in the private and public sector _ Promoting health and disease prevention efforts, with an emphasis on fighting AIDS, and increasing the number of health care professionals serving the Hispanic community and increasing Hispanic input in health care policy issues _ Supporting better access to bonding and insurance for small businesses

 Standing on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s doorstep, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> called on the people of this desert nation Tuesday to assist victims of racial discrimination who are `` deprived of their legitimate rights.'' The pope, on a one-day visit to diamond-rich and bone-dry <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, praised the nation as `` an island of peace in a troubled sea.'' <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, a landlocked country of 1.1 million people, has never fought a battle in its 22 years of independence despite bordering such turbulent places as <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` You are a peace-loving and friendly people who believe in the basic equality and human dignity of every man and woman,'' the pontiff told about 2,000 people who greeted him at the airport, including a choir of bare-breasted, teen-age schoolgirls. Later, in a speech at the Cathedral of Christ the King, the pontiff clearly referred to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and its apartheid policies of racial segregation, without mentioning the country by name. `` You have witnessed the plight of those who are subjected by law to discrimination,'' the pontiff told the audience in <LOCATION> Gaborone </LOCATION>, 10 miles from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s northern border. `` I gladly support your desire to be close to those who are unjustly deprived of their legitimate rights and lack decent living conditions.'' The pope arrived Tuesday from <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, the first stop on his five-nation tour of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He travels Wednesday to <LOCATION> Lesotho </LOCATION>, a mountain kingdom surrounded by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where he is likely to make additional comments on apartheid. The pontiff is not visiting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> on this trip but the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has said he may do so in the future. At an afternoon mass in <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s national stadium, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> renewed his call for regional peace to a crowd of 50,000 _ more than <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>'s entire Catholic population of 45,000. Several thousand of those attending were from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, according to church officials. `` What are the causes of humanity's fears?'' the pontiff said. `` It is the absence of justice and peace in our lives, and in the world, that so often troubles us and arouses our fears.'' `` Nation still lifts sword against nation. There is much training for war,'' he said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has raided <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> several times in past years killing alleged guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The pope was serenaded by several hundred members of a women's choir and received gifts from Catholic parishes around the country Two parishes from western <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> brought crosses they had carried by foot and car across the <LOCATION> Kalahari </LOCATION> desert, which makes up 80 percent of <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> has a Western-style, multiparty democracy, a rarity in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Diamond mines make it relatively wealthy on the continent but it remains heavily dependent economically on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. On papal matters, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said Tuesday the pope would return to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> next year, with stops in <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION> and the island nation of <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>. There has been speculation that the trip, expected next May, also may include <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarrro </PERSON>, traveling with the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, said neither country was `` on the program,'' although he confirmed that Angolan bishops had recently sent an invitation to the pope.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s campaigns for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been pretty dull affairs the last couple of decades; he's won every one by a landslide. This year, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> hopes for something new. He hopes to lose. At least he says he hopes to lose. Nothing comes at face value in <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> politics, a world where tempers run hot, bad blood runs deep and rap sheets serve as the nearest thing to a score card. What is certain is that the race for <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s seat is one of the oddest in years, even by <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> standards. A month ago, convicted of corruption, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> quit his office. Now, he just might win it back. `` What we've got there are pretty unique circumstances,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Smock </PERSON>, historian of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>. Without checking, he said, the last case of an unwilling winner to spring to mind occurred in 1788. Of course, <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> has yet to win, and his opponents in the Democratic primary predict he wo n't. `` People have a lot of affection for him,'' said state <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>. `` But they're not going to vote for him.'' Some will. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s focus on constituent services made him immensely popular in his district, which takes in much of the north <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>. He won each of his last six races with at least 90 percent of the vote. Indeed, his career came to an end at the jury box rather than the ballot box. Twice in the past year he was convicted of federal corruption charges, and he was facing expulsion from the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when he tearfully quit last month. In addition to resigning his seat, `` I am withdrawing as a candidate for re-election,'' he said at the time. `` I will not campaign. I will not run.'' But neither of his opponents in the primary Thursday is remotely as well known as <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>; even a strong sympathy vote conceivably could win him the nomination. And because Democrats outnumber Republicans 3-1 in the district, the Democratic nominee generally wins the seat. In any case, there is only one candidate on the Republican line: <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. The issue goes beyond <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> Democratic organization has been shaken by recent corruption convictions of party leaders. If <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> won and declined to serve, the organization could reassert itself by naming its own candidate to run in a special election, which are held without primaries. Borough President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON>, who presents himself as a reformer, was concerned enough this week to warn voters away from <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>. `` We in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> have worked hard to recover our lost respect,'' he said. `` Let's not lose an opportunity to better the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> by throwing away a vote.'' One issue is why <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> remained on the ballot at all. He did not contest his opponents' court challenge of his nominating petitions, hoping, said his lawyer, to be thrown off the ballot. But the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> already had ruled the petitions valid, and without evidence otherwise, the court upheld it. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>'s federal prosecutor expressed a dim view of the suggestion that he move out of state as a ploy to disqualify himself. And with no other legal reason for the court to remove him from the ballot, he stayed on. A victory by one of the challengers would make the matter moot. <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, a state assemblyman since 1977, has won all the key endorsements. Also running is a former assemblyman, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchiselli </PERSON>, who has sought to link <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> to the discredited party organization. The fight has been hostile, though traditional issues have hardly figured in it. The race itself is the issue: <PERSON> Marchiselli </PERSON> charged that <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> sought secretly to keep <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> on the ballot so <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marchiselli </PERSON> would split the Italian-American vote. <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, meanwhile, charged that politicians who want the seat were conducting a `` whispering campaign'' to win votes for <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON> so the party would designate them to run in a special election. <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, who faces sentencing for his latest conviction next month, is keeping quiet. He declined to be interviewed, and a spokesman, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON>, would refer only to the resignation statement saying he would not campaign. `` At the juncture where we are, that stands,'' <PERSON> Blancato </PERSON> said. `` After Thursday, there may be a need for a new statement.''

<TEXT>
 An appellate court heard arguments Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> decision to abolish the fairness doctrine for broadcasters both hurt and advanced the cause of free speech. The requirement that television and radio stations present opposing viewpoints on controversial questions was a `` prevalent deterrent to broadcasters to air public issues,'' FCC general counsel <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> told a panel of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here. `` Elimination of the doctrine would best further the public's interest in recieving robust debate on controversial issues,'' she told the three-judge panel, which is reviewing last year's 4-0 <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> vote abolishing the fairness standard The FCC found that because there were so many sources of information, the 38-year-old fairness doctrine was no longer needed to ensure the dissemination of all points of view in the debate on a public issue, she said. Enforcement of the fairness doctrine prompted many broadcasters to avoid controversial issues so they would not be required to air all sides to a question and the result was bland speech, she said. But <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON>, executive director of the Media Access Project, accused the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> of ignoring abundant evidence that many broadcast outlets had not presented alternate points of view on controversial subjects. `` There was a blatant predisposition to reach this result, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has flip-flopped,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patricia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wald </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` Why should n't an agency that now says we're concerned about core First Amendment values get credit for that?'' <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> asked. `` It's one thing for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to say it's sensitive to First Amendment concerns,'' <PERSON> Schwartzman </PERSON> said. But he accused the agency of conducting a `` one-sided and narrow review.'' If it found that the regulation had a chilling effect on free speech, `` the commission is free to tinker with the adminstration of the fairness doctrine,'' he said. `` It's very convenient outcome for the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to say ` there is a very chilling effect, we have to throw out the whole thing.''' But <PERSON> Killory </PERSON> argued that stricter enforcment `` would require the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to get into the editorial judgment of broadcasters.'' The fairness doctrine requires broadcast stations to present the opposing viewpoint on a controversial issue in the event that the other side had purchased advertising to promote its arguments. The doctrine's constitutionality was upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1969, but in 1984 the high court said it would review that decision if presented with new evidence that enforcement was no longer necessary. The next year, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> concluded the doctrine no longer served the public interest but said it would continue its enforcement because of uncertainty over whetherit was legally binding. In 1986, the federal appeals court here found that the fairness doctrine was not codified as part of the 1959 Communications Act. <ORGANIZATION> Meredith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> then challenged the constitutionality of the fairness doctrine after the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> found that a station it owned in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, had filed to present opposing views about the construction of a nuclear power plant. The appeals court ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to consider <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>'s constitutional challenge, a review that resulted in the Aug. 4, 1987 vote to abolish the doctrine <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a prominent First Amendment lawyer who represents <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, urged the panel to `` defer to old-fashioned commission expertise'' which found that `` the public is receiving information not because of the fairness doctrine but in spite of the fairness doctrine.'' Communications attorney <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyk </PERSON> predicted `` the case will turn on a constitutional issue. I think this is a case for the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.'' Organizations supporting the CC included the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Reporters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for the Freedom of the Press and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Cuban Embassy charged Tuesday that its commercial attache, who was expelled along with the ambassador, opened fire on a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operative who had tried to get him to defect. The commercial attache, Third Secretary <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, and the ambassador, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez-Mell </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Tuesday on a scheduled flight for <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, en route to the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> capital, <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. In a statement read on the embassy steps, First Secretary <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Armas </PERSON> charged that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> operative was a former <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat who defected in June _ <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Azpillaga </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombard </PERSON>. De Armas claimed <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secret services had worked together during the incident. The British Foreign Office was enraged by the shooting because of its strict ban on diplomats carrying arms. `` The traitor in a menacing way instructed <PERSON> Senor </PERSON> <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> to defect,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Armas </PERSON>. `` In reply to this he took out the gun he was carrying, fired it and the group ran away.'' <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> police said in a statement that anti-terrorist squad detectives `` traced and interviewed'' a man slighted injured in the Monday afternoon shooting and `` we are wholly satisfied he was not posing a threat to anyone.'' `` We will not be releasing his details,'' the statement from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard police headquarters added. `` Following the action of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the inquiry is now closed.'' Officials at <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard refused to elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> told ambassador Fernandez-Mell he must take responsibility for <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> being armed, but the ambassador told reporters at the airport that he found his swift ousting `` very strange.'' The British domestic new agency, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said police sources confirmed that the wounded man `` was a security officer'' and part of a team keeping the diplomat under surveillance. Witnesses have said that <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, who opened fire outside his apartment in west <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, shot at a group of three men and a woman who fled in a car. He was stopped by police, claimed diplomatic immunity and then told the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> he fired because he was in fear of his life. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on the reports that the communist diplomat was under <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security surveillance. `` We have reacted appropriately to a totally unacceptable and outrageous action on the streets of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' said a spokesman, who according to British civil service practice, declined to be identified. <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> Radio, in a broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Aspillaga </PERSON> defected from the Cuban Embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, in June 1987 `` to put himself at the service of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.'' The radio called the expulsion of <PERSON> Medina </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> `` deeply unfair and arbitary,'' saying it had absolutely nothing to do with the incident. Since a policewoman was shot and killed by a gunman firing from the Libyan embassy at demonstrators in April 1984, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has taken a harsh attitude towards violations of its blanket ban on embassies having guns. The Cubans were expelled within days of a Vietnamese diplomat being ordered out for brandishing a gun at demonstrators outside his embassy. In normal circumstances, British policeman are not armed, a fact which heightens official anger at gun-toting diplomats. In his statement, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomat <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Armas </PERSON> said the alleged <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operative could not have entered <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> without collusion between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities. He demanded to know what had happened to the wounded man and why the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities refused to identify him. `` It is possible now that both the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities as well as the British and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> secret services will find themselves in an embarrassing situation when they explain what really happened,'' said <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Armas </PERSON>. The expulsions mean <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has 12 diplomats left in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has five diplomats in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania Officials To Certify Radon Testers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where the seriousness of radon contamination first came to light when a man set off radiation alarms at a nuclear plant, the state is moving to regulate companies that test homes for the deadly gas. The steps are the outgrowth of nearly four years experience with radon, an odorless, colorless gas the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has now linked to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday every home in the country should be tested for radon because contamination is wider spread than previously believed. Radon is a radioactive gas, trace amounts of which are produced in the decay of uranium in soil and rocks. The gas is present in the outdoors normally at about 0.5 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 4 picocurie `` action level.'' Homes tend to concentrate radon indoors. Radon kills people by leaving its radioactive decay products in the lungs, irradiating the tissues for a lifetime. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> will require companies testing for the gas to pass a state-approved course in radon detection, demonstrate at least a year of professional experience and agree to provide radon-testing data to the government, said <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> official. After Sept. 21, `` it will be illegal to provide radon services in the state unless they are certified,'' he said Tuesday. `` It's simply a health issue which needs to be investigated house by house,'' <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON> said. `` The problem levels are sprodadic, but in being sporadic, they're spread across the entire country. There are n't really bad areas, there are problem homes.'' <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON>, who works in the DER's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radiation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>, said his office received `` a tremendous number'' of calls Tuesday because of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> report. `` What we are really telling them is the same message we have been giving the public for a year now,'' <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON> said. `` That message, based on DER data from the past, is that problem homes can occur anywhere in the state, but most people after testing do n't have a problem. In neighboring <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had received more than 50 calls by mid-day Tuesday from residents concerned about the effects of radon gas. `` What the people are mainly concerned about is how they can get the radon kits to have their homes tested,'' said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovack </PERSON>, a radiological technician for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've been furnishing them with a list of places where they can obtain the kits and along with that list, we've sent a couple of pamphlets that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has put out for concerned homeowners.'' The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> department plans to publish guidelines for contractors and homeowners on specific remediation techniques for homes with unacceptable radon levels, <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON> said. A companion booklet will offer tips on selecting contractors, along with a list of state-certified contractors, he said. `` This will help the public in that the industry will be regulated,'' he said. `` We have n't seen severe problems, but you want to make sure problems do n't occur, that the firms have proper training and that they are following the proper methods for remediation.'' Of the 429 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> homes tested in the national survey released Monday, 37 percent had more than 4 picocuries of radioactivity per liter of air, the level used by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> as the trigger for more sophisticated tests that determine if remediation is needed. The highest level was 114 in <LOCATION> Perry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Those readings contrast to levels in the thousands of picocuries found previously in the uranium-rich Reading Prong geological formation of eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON> said. Those earlier findings were accurate but rare, he said. `` What it did was present a distorted picture of the radon situation,'' he said. `` The highest reading we have encountered outside the Reading Prong is no more than 800. And now, we do a statistically random study and the highest reading is 114.'' On Dec. 14, 1984, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Watras </PERSON>, a field engineer for a subcontractor building <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Limerick </LOCATION> nuclear plant, tripped radiation alarms as he went to work. Investigators discovered his home atop the Reading Prong had radon levels 675 times the acceptable state guidelines. He and his family were evacuated. The discovery awoke scientists and officials to the severity of radon contamination in some areas and led to the creation of the radiation bureau in <LOCATION> Gilbertsville </LOCATION>, about a two miles from <PERSON> Watras </PERSON>' home

 Consumers planning to test their homes for radon in the wake of the report by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> can get some free help through state agencies and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Radon Program said homeowners or renters should get a copy of the `` Citizen's Guide to Radon'' available through state agencies or an area EPA office. The guide outlines steps consumers should take when using one of the several commercially available home testing kits. Before purchasing a home kit, Page said, people should check with a list of 216 companies that have passed the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s proficiency test. Also, it is important to carefully follow kit instructions because even a slight deviation can easily alter the results, he said. If the reading is 4 picocuries or higher, Page suggests a follow-up test. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Belanger </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional radiation representative for <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, said homeowners also can buy, for $ 400, a continuous radon monitor that uses electronic detectors to count the disintegration of radon particles. Once the level is known, several steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. One method, called sub-slab ventilation, is used in homes with the highest levels and costs $ 800 to $ 1,500. It involves poking a hole in the basement floor and inserting a polyvinylchloride pipe that leads to the attic or the outside where a fan carries away the gas. This can reduce the radon level by as much as 99 percent, <PERSON> Page </PERSON> said. Two other relatively easy methods are sealing the sump pump or ventilating crawl spaces. A third method, caulking any cracks in the basement floor, should almost always be used in conjunction with another method, he added. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaertner </PERSON>, a A <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Gilbertsville </LOCATION>, the state's central office for radon issues, said <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> is one of two states with a radon certification program for companies providing radon services _ kits, staff visits, remediation and supplies. Companies are now applying for certification, and by the winter, the DER should have published a list of certified firms.

<HEAD>Senate Drops Effort to Fund Abortions for Rape, Incest Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> surrendered to political reality Tuesday and gave up its fight to permit federally funded abortions for poor victims of rape and incest. Facing strong House opposition, a White House veto threat and the prospect of a $ 140 billion social spending bill held hostage to the abortion controversy, the chamber agreed by voice vote to scrap its position. The vote came after two roll calls in which members first refused, 46-44, and then agreed, 47-43, to kill a motion to insist on allowing federal Medicaid payments for abortions in promptly reported rape and incest cases. Abortion was the only area of disagreement between the two chambers in the huge spending bill for the departments of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and Education. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> view last Friday, voting 216-166 to continue the current policy of federal funds only when an abortion is needed to save a woman's life. Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the subcommittee that handled the spending bill, pleaded with his colleagues to accept defeat and help enact the overall measure `` We're talking about a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that we're 50 votes short in. We're talking about a president that's going to veto the bill. We're talking about a clock that's ticking,'' <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON> said. `` You can stand on principle forever and you'll have nothing, if you do n't know when you have to close that gap.''' The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 73-19 in July to expand Medicaid to pay for abortions in rape or incest cases that are promptly reported. States would have had the option of retaining the current, more limited policy. The abortion provision was part of the $ 140 billion Labor-HHS-Education measure for fiscal 1989, which begins Oct. 1. The bill contains money for medical research, job training, college loans and programs for disadvantaged children, among many other items. In a Sept. 7 letter to congressional leaders, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reiterated his intention to veto the entire package if it came to him with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s abortion provision. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> language would permit the use of federal funds for the salughter of unborn children, depriving the innocent of the most basic of civil rights _ the right to life,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> wrote. `` I urge the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to vote to protect the lives of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s unborn children.'' The rhetoric on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor Tuesday was equally intense. Sen. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON>, D-Md., a social worker, said she vividly recalls the coat-hanger abortions suffered by poor women without access to the high-priced society doctors willing to perform underground abortions `` Abortion is a legal medical procedure that is now available to women who are well-off. Denying it to poor women is discrimination, pure and simple,'' she said. <PERSON> Mikulski </PERSON> also said that making a woman bear the child of her attacker is `` grotesque and inhumane.'' But Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, argued that a child conceived by rape is not `` any less of a human being than one who is not ... One atrocity ... does n't justify another. Rape does n't justify murder.'' Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, R-Conn., who launched the crusade for wider federal abortion coverage, excoriated the administration for pressing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to the wall on the issue `` They're going to use their last gasp and their last piece of political capital'' to deny abortions to rape and incest victims, <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> charged. `` What a legacy for an outgoing president.'' <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON>, who is up for re-election this year, acknowledged in advance that he was beaten on the floor vote. But he added, `` I think it's important that the record be established ... so people understand how they can respond on Election Day.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right-to-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> termed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> votes `` a sharp setback for the pro-abortion movement groups'' and said the administration's support had been `` extremely helpful.'' Fourteen states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> pay for Medicaid abortions but only receive federal reimbursement in life-threatening cases. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote in July was the first time since 1981 that either chamber of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had approved more liberal eligibility.

<HEAD>Who's Who Survey Finds Teen-Age Suicide Persists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly half the nation's high-achieving teen-agers knew someone who committed suicide or tried to, and 30 percent said they've considered killing themselves, according to a survey released Tuesday. A separate survey of adults found that a third of them knew a teen-ager who committed suicide or tried to. `` You do n't have to be a psychologist to realize all of the things that are crashing in on these kids today,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Krouse </PERSON>, publisher of the directory, `` Who's <ORGANIZATION> Who </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Among </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>,'' which conducted the survey of teen-agers. The survey polled 2,024 teen-agers listed in the directory and found that 45 percent said they knew a teen-ager who had attempted suicide or succeeded. Four percent said they had tried it. <PERSON> Krouse </PERSON> said Tuesday he believed the findings would be much higher in a survey of the general teen-age population. High achievers likely `` are less vulnerable than a general teen audience because they have much more success and they seem to be coming from more stable, family backgrounds where there is more parental involvement,'' he said. A separate national survey of 1,000 adults, questioned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>, found that 27 percent said they knew a teen-ager who had tried to commit suicide and 17 percent knew a teen-ager who had succeeded. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Riter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Riter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, company that conducted the survey, said there was some overlap between the two groups and that 32 percent knew a teen-ager in one of the two categories. The other survey, `` Teen-Agers at Risk: an Adult Perspective,'' found that 72.4 percent of those interviewed believe teen-agers today face more serious problems than they did at the same age. In the Who's Who survey, the percentage of those polled who knew someone who had tried or committed suicide was down from 48 percent in 1987, but the poll's margin of error was 2 percentage points, <PERSON> Krouse </PERSON> said. The survey also showed `` the problem may be especially serious among black high achievers,'' the company said. It found that 10 percent of the black high-achievers polled this year said they had attempted suicide. Five percent of those surveyed were black. Asked what factors contributed most to teen-age suicide, 86 percent of the high achievers said a feeling of worthlessness; 84 percent said a feeling of isolation and loneliness; 72 percent said pressure to achieve; and 65 percent said a fear of failure. Most of those surveyed said they felt suicide prevention hotlines, awareness programs for teen-agers and their parents and private counseling in school would help combat the problem. Students with grade point averages of A or B can be nominated for listing in the Who's Who high school directory. The most recent directory listed about 575,000 students, said spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadowski </PERSON>. The Who's Who survey also found that: _ Drug use continues to decline among the nation's brightest high school students, with less than 1 percent reporting they smoke marijuana more than once a month That's down from 4 percent five years ago and 11 percent a decade ago. _ Alcohol use also is decreasing, with 63 percent saying they never drink alcohol, compared with 50 percent in 1978 and 48 percent in 1983 _ About 75 percent said they had never had sexual intercourse _ Forty-eight percent believe schools should dispense condoms to curb the spread of AIDS, and 49 percent believe schools should provide other contraceptives to reduce the number of pregnancies _ Twenty-eight percent said they do n't approve of abortion under any circumstances, while 22 percent said they approved of abortion at a woman's discretion _ Thirty-two percent said they support Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for president, 23 percent favored <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 10 percent liked former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and 30 percent were undecided

<TEXT>
 The first Marines sent to help battle forest fires that have charred nearly 1 million acres of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> arrived Tuesday as the wet weather that has helped quiet flames began to lift. The Marines will help bolster sagging firefighter numbers in the park and provide relief for fire crews that have been on fire lines for some time, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Valen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` We knew we were losing our crews,'' he said. `` Some of them have been out there way past the usual 21-day assignement. Some need to get back to college. So we're rotating a lot of crews out.'' About 550 Marines flew into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to help the estimated 7,200 firefighters still in the park battling fires that have plagued northwestern <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> since early July. However, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> will have received only two days of training before they are placed on fire lines and will have to be accompanied by seasoned firefighters, <PERSON> Valen </PERSON> said, putting additional pressure on fire personnel. In all, 1,200 Marines are being sent, with 1,400 Army soldiers due from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, to double the number of military personnel assigned to the fires. By Tuesday, the fires had blackened 939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park. Fires in the national forests and parks surrounding <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> bring the total burned acreage to 1.4 million acres. Fires also burned Tuesday in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where 8,000 people were evacuated from communities in an area northeast of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, which had its last big fire almost under control at 8500 acres. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's biggest fire, in <ORGANIZATION> Colville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, was declared contained at 20,126 acres. Controversy has surrounded the Yellowstone fires because of the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s `` let burn'' policy, of not fighting most fires that start naturally. In past years such fires have remained small, but critics blame the policy for letting fires get out of control in this unusually dry summer. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday he had not been aware of the policy, but said <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> told him `` we were withdrawing this policy.'' Colorado Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would join him, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> on Thursday to survey fire damage in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and discuss policy. <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was changing his campaign schedule for the meeting. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> had no immediate comment about any <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> appearance, said a media assistant, <PERSON> Tripp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. Rain that had fallen on parts of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> since Saturday tapered off Tuesday, but had continued longer than expected. The forecast called for partial clearing by Wednesday and for temperatures to rise to the low 70s by Thursday. But the weather remained cool enough Tuesday that officials began distributing cold-weather gear donated by residents of communities around <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to firefighters. Few firefighters had been prepared for the cold, wet weather that limited fire activity and the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and other organizations started collecting coats and other clothing to send to fire camps. Firefighters continued to take advantage of the cool weather to strengthen fire lines in anticipation of the warmer, drier weather. `` The fires are still a threat, we are not out of it yet,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Capek </PERSON>. `` We know there is some more fire time left in the season, but hopefully it wo n't be as intense.'' Along the north side of the park in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, school resumed Tuesday in <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, the park's northern entrance, after being closed Monday, but an evacuation plan was ready in case fires advanced, said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Gallatin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Near <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and Silver Gate just outside the park's northeast tip, rehabilitation work has already begun along fire lines flanking the 81,400-acre Storm Creek fire, which threatened the towns for several days last week Information officer <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> said crews were smoothing dirt over bulldozed lines, repairing creek drainages and planting some fire lines.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> got an earful of complaints about housing and food problems in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> for the second day in a row Tuesday, and then tore into local officials for mismanagement. `` I felt that it's already impossible to talk to the people,'' the Soviet leader said in a meeting with local officials in the city of <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION>. `` Wherever I was, on the street in a factory, or here, the people are simply at your throat. And I think they're right.'' His comments were included in an hourlong report about his visit on the Soviet television evening news program `` Vremya.'' The visit has received heavy TV coverage, emphasizing the importance of his message. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>, also a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, discussed housing and other problems of everyday life on Tuesday with workers in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>. The public appearances by both men seemed to be part of a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> effort to show concern about poor living conditions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made the issue of improving the daily lives of average Soviets a key element of his policy of perestroika, or restructuring of Soviet society. He has said he is not satisfied with the efforts made so far. The Politburo has called for building enough new housing to give every family its own apartment by the year 2000. Local officials tried to explain their approaches to solving the region's problems, but were clearly embarrassed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s criticism One <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> official told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> residents receive the government's recommended yearly allotment of 154 pounds of meat, but the Soviet leader retorted that people laugh at such standards. He said Chinese and Japanese eat much less meat, `` but everyone who goes there says everything is on the shelf to buy. That's the story. People are laughing at these scientifically based norms.'' Soviet citizens shown on televised reports of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s frequent visits around the country usually praise his policies, or ask uncritical questions But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ran into loud complaints about life in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> upon flying to the Siberian city, about 2,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, following a six-week vacation. He said the slow rate of development in the huge <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> region was a constant topic of concern in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The region encompasses one-tenth of the entire <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, produces half of its coal and 20 percent of its forest products. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the government has invested billions of rubles in the area and is getting little in return. He told workers at the Khimvolokno synthetic fiber factory in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> that the Politburo was giving special attention to a shortage of kindergartens. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted one worker as shooting back: `` We have kindergartens! We do n't have housing, and the medical facilities are bad.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> heard similar complaints Monday when he stopped in <LOCATION> Yemelyanovo </LOCATION> village on his way to <LOCATION> Kransoyarsk </LOCATION> from the airport after arriving from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` We have no hot water! You do what you can to wash!,'' one man shouted at the 57-year-old Communist Party chief. `` I'll tell you right off, comrades, that we can not count on successful perestroika if the people ... -LRB- have -RRB- got so many problems piling up to form a single big problem, that of inadequate social amenities,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. He spoke frequently about environmental problems, criticizing `` gigantomania'' _ the propensity to build huge factories and power stations regardless of their impact on the environment. Too often projects `` carried out under the flag of Communism threaten nature, and the interests of the people are considered last,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said that on <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Vladivostok </LOCATION>, workers at the <PERSON> Dalvostok </PERSON> ship repair yard complained about work and living conditions, medical care, shortages of consumer goods and cultural amenities.

 There she is, No. 1 in the weekly Nielsen ratings, <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> estimates that between 50 and 55 million viewers watched all or part of `` The Miss American Pageant'' on Saturday night. It was the highest-ranked pageant since 1982's was No. 1. This year's pageant rated 22.3 with a 44 share, an improvement over last year's, which had a rating of 20.4 and a 42 share, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The highest-rated pageant was in 1986 when it got a 23.0 rating and a 44 share. Each rating point represents 886,000 homes with televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use. The other two networks ran college football games against the pageant that ended up ranked 59th and 60th, respectively. The two <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> shows that preceded Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Saturday ranked second and third in the weekly ratings. One of them was especially good news for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, the preview of a new show, `` Baby Boom,'' based on the movie by the same name and starring <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> as an executive who inherits a baby. It ranked third. It had preceded Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and followed `` Golden Girls,'' which was No. 2 in the ratings. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> said the `` Baby Boom'' rating was the highest this season for the network in that time period. The rest of the top 10 were: `` The Cosby Show'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Monday Night Football _ <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, the Bob Hope Special on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Full House'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> in its Tuesday time period, `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, `` Cheers'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and `` 227'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. For the week ending Sept. 11, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won with a 12.6. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 11.2. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was third with 9.3. It's the 51st week since the season began last September, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has a season-to-date rating of 14.5 to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' 12.2 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s 12.1. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has placed first in 45 out of 51 weeks. The lowest-rated prime-time shows were: `` <PERSON> Blacke </PERSON>'s Magic,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Saturday Morning Preview,'' `` Funny People,'' `` <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Vs. Notre Dame,'' `` <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Vs. <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Highwayman Special,'' `` 48 Hours: Smoking War,'' `` First Impressions,'' `` <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s Place'' and `` Tickets Please.'' The evening news race was even tighter than usual, perhaps partially due to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> CBS affiliate moving the `` CBS Evening News'' to 6:30, putting it against <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight.'' `` NBC Nightly News'' is on its own in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> at 7. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> represents about 7 percent of the total television audience. But a lot of stations pre-empted network news last week for the <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> telethon, and that skewed the numbers. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said it had an ever lower station clearance because of `` Monday Night Football,'' 96 percent to 97 percent for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and 98 percent for CBS. CBS and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' tied with a rating of 9.5. `` NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.4. Each of the three got a 20 share. <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> recorded the highest rating yet for its prime-time series when `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted,'' with got a 9.0 and ranked 43rd among all network shows. Two other <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> shows, `` Married ... with Children'' and `` 21 Jump Street'' also landed high enough in the ratings to out-rank several network programs.

<TEXT>
 The federal <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that a literacy test all <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> teachers were required to pass to keep their jobs discriminated against teachers who were black or over 40. State officials said they do not agree with the ruling and plan to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to modify or reverse the decision. A summary of the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> ruling was released by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We said all along that the test was discriminatory toward blacks and older teachers,'' said <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> Besteiro </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` This means that school districts will have to go back and review their records to see which former teachers might be eligible for reinstatement, back pay or pension adjustments,'' <PERSON> Besteiro </PERSON> said. In the spring of 1986, teachers and school administrators had two chances to pass the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Examination of Current Administrators and Teachers, or TECAT. Out of the estimated 200,000 teachers and administrators in the state, 1,875 failed the test and were not qualified to work in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> schools that fall. `` Failure rates for blacks and older persons indicated that the TECAT adversely impacts on blacks and persons within the protected age group under -LRB- federal law -RRB- who were either applicants or employees for teaching positions in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> public school system in 1986,'' the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> said. State figures showed a passing rate for whites of 99.9 percent, compared to 98.9 percent for Hispanics and 95.4 percent for blacks. State education Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> challenged the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> decision, said the same statewide results showed that 99.29 percent of educators under age 40 passed the test, while 99.64 percent of teachers over 40 passed. `` Older educators did better on the test than younger ones. The results clearly refute the contention that the test discriminated against individuals on the basis of age,'' he said Tuesday. `` The test was a fair and accurate measure of the examinees' basic reading and writing skills that was in no way influenced by race or age,'' <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said He said another federal agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, had looked at the test and `` found no evidence whatsoever of racial discrimination.'' The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> ruling was made in response to complaints filed by several of the failed teachers against their school districts, the state and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which approved the content and passing score of the exam. The teachers association represented the teachers before the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, legal counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, argued the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> erred in its findings about the literacy test. `` We do n't think their findings are factually or legally valid,'' he said. `` I think they got their facts wrong and failed to consider some legal precedents that affect the case.'' State attorneys are negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> officials before taking any action, said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> officials had asked for additional information, including the civil rights report. `` We are confident they will revise their decision when they review the complete information,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jury Find Seven Officers Guilty</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal jury Tuesday found seven former and current police officers guilty of 55 counts charging them with accepting more than 18,000 in bribes from restaurants and bars to overlook violations and perform special services. The jury had deliberated for six days. The seven officers showed little or no emotion as the verdicts were read. Each officer was convicted of two counts under the federal racketeering statute, or RICO, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine. Some defendants also were found guilty of federal extortion charges, substantive mail fraud and mail fraud conspiracy. In all, the officers were found guilty of 55 counts of a 58-count indictment. During closing arguments two weeks ago, Special Prosecutor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Farmer of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said the case was `` about misuse of office for personal gain. It's about each one of them using their power as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police officers to line their own pockets.'' But defense attorneys argued that the money accepted from business owners that led to the indictment was just Christmas and vacation gifts from people with whom the officers worked closely over several years. Defense attorney <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON> called the government's allegations of racketeering a `` gossamer web'' that would collapse under careful scrutiny <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON> admitted his client, Detective <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, accepted $ 400 for himself from a bar manager on two occasions. But <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON> said <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> did not conspire with the other defendants and was not guilty of racketeering or extortion. `` My client, in accepting money, was wrong. But it was not a felony. This was not an illegal conspiracy,'' he said during the trial. <PERSON> Cardinale </PERSON> said the officers deserved disciplinary action from their department, but were not racketeers. The seven officers convicted Tuesday were <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilroe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Boylan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nave </PERSON>. Much of the prosecution's case revolved around tape recordings made by the manager of the 1270, a downtown nightclub. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON> became an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant. Defense attorney's challenged <PERSON> McGowan </PERSON>'s credibility, saying he had lied about being in the Marines and about being blind in one eye.

<HEAD>EPA Issues Regulations On Underground Tanks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday issued a 370-page set of regulations that requires almost all owners of underground tanks, including the corner gasoline station, to test and protect their tanks, fix leaks and clean up spills. One set of requirements applies to all tanks installed after December of this year. Another set gradually applies to the nearly 2 million existing tanks _ 97 percent of them holding gasoline or other petroleum products _ and makes them generally meet the new tank standards in December 1998. The first requirement to bite is that existing tanks more than 25 years old must have leak detection systems _ which may be inventory checks and annual tightness tests _ installed in the coming year, with the requirement applying to the youngest tanks in 1993. Corrosion protection systems and spill and overfilling prevention devices would be required only in 1998. About 80 percent of the tanks in use are steel tanks without protection against rust. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> says its surveys show that anywhere from 10 percent to 30 percent of the 750,000 tank locations have, or have had, significant leaks. Only about 5 percent of existing tanks have leak detection systems. The regulations, four years in the drafting, require double-walled tanks or similar double-barrier protection only for some 60,000 chemical tanks, and one environmental group immediately criticized the agency for the omission. Failure to require double barriers for petroleum product tanks means `` EPA is leaving the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supply of drinking water vulnerable to petroleum contamination,'' said staff scientists <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> of the Environmental Defense Fund. `` The regulations are designed to minimize their impact on the regulated community, not to protect the environment and the public from the hzards of petroleum contamination,'' she said. But <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator with jurisdiction over the tank program, said that `` secondary containment is quite expensive'' and would add unspecified billions to the cost of the final regulations. One of his staff, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, said a double-barrier requirement would add $ 80,000 to the cost of a new three-tank service station, and existing stations would have to rip out all their tanks if the requirement were imposed on existing installations. Such a station might have to spend $ 3,000 to $ 8,000 on a leak detection system and $ 10,000 to $ 48,000 on an electrical rust-prevention system, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated. As it stands, the agency estimated that tank owners will have to spend the equivalent of $ 54 billion in today's dollars, but the owners and society will reap $ 73 billion worth of benefits in reduced damage, inventory losses and cleanup costs. It did not present an estimate of the extra costs and benefits associated with double barriers, nor did it estimate health benefits from less contamination of groundwater. `` Whether you're mom and pop or <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, it does n't make a lot of sense to keep a leaking gasoline tank in the ground. The liability is enormous,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. About a dozen states already have tank regulations of their own in place, and part of Tuesday's regulatory package was the announcement of procedures by which states can win approval of those programs from <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. A state does not have to have a program at all, which would leave <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to enforce the new regulations. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said the agency at this point had made no provision for operating tank programs, and `` we hope very few'' states will opt out. Still to come in about six weeks are regulations prescribing financial responsibilities of tank owners. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administers a $ 500 million fund to help pay for cleanups. The regulations exempt septic tanks, tanks of 1,100 gallons or less storing fuel for farm or non-commercial use, home heating oil tanks and tanks on basement floors, which are considered above-ground tanks. The regulations take effect 90 days from publication, expected soon in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Tuesday that Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s child care plan would help provide children with `` tender, loving family care'' while the Democratic plan favored by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would lead to `` licensing grandmothers.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidate for president, has proposed a plan to give tax credits of up to $ 1,000 to assist families with child care. The money could be used either to pay for outside child care or to enable a mother to stay home and take care of her children instead of working. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential candidate, has endorsed a bill by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., providing for the federal government to reimburse providers of child care The providers would have to meet federal standards in order to receive the funds. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said recently that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed tax credit was `` as likely to be used for household expenses'' as for care of children and would fall far short of the $ 3,000 average annual cost per family for child care. He also said it would fail to repay the wages lost by a mother who stays home. But <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, speaking at a Rose Garden ceremony at which he signed a proclamation setting the current week aside as <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan `` will allow parents to choose among a variety of options if they need child care assistance.'' `` Experts tell us what common sense always has _ the best people to take care of children are family members,'' the president said. `` And that's the kind of care that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan will help provide _ tender, loving, family care. `` Now, compare this plan with the one offered by the liberals. They've written a bill that gives assistance not to the parent, but to the person who provides the care. And why? Because they want to make sure that they have control over the kind of care your child receives. `` And that means if you want to leave your child with his grandmother during the day, she will have to be licensed under federal standards if she's to be given assistance for helping to raise her grandhild. Licensing grandmothers. Can you believe it? Well, I think it's terrible, and I do n't think the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are going to stand for it.'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> commented, `` No one is worried about the kinds who are left in their grandmother's care; in a perfect world, every infant and every young child would have a parent or grandparent who could stay at home and look after him. `` What we are worried about and what the Act for <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> will address is the millions of children whose parents do n't have that option, who work for a living and have to leave their kids in the hands of strangers _ in day care centers and family day care homes. That's where we need at least some minimum health, safety and competency standards.'' <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacson </PERSON>, press secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on children and the family, headed by <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, said it was true that a grandmother would have to meet federal standards in order to receive funds under the bill. `` How else can you design a program that receives federal funds?'' he asked. `` You just ca n't give federal funds out without some assurance that they are not going to be used for child neglect and abuse. We are not worried about grandmothers; we are worried about 16 - and 17-year-olds and people who have no training and no qualifications.

<HEAD>Soviets to Buy 350,000 More Metric Tons of Corn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 350,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery during the coming year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The sale brought total corn sold to the Soviets in the last two weeks for the 1988-89 delivery year that started Sept. 1 to more than 2.95 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 350,000 tons of corn would be about 13.8 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.73 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 38 million. As with the other recent sales, no indication was given whether the new sales of corn to the Soviets would count under the current long-term grain supply agreement between the two countries or be carried forward separately in case a new pact is forthcoming. The current five-year pact is set to expire Sept. 30 and negotiators are trying to work out a new one, or at least an extension of the current agreement, to take effect on Oct. 1. According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. Prior to sales announced since Sept. 1, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year of the agreement, plus 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

<HEAD>White House Aide Opposed Change in Product Labels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> proposal to allow up to 10 percent salvaged meat and tiny bone chips in hot dogs without telling consumers about it on product labels was made over the objections of a White House regulatory aide, documents disclosed Tuesday. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Plager </PERSON>, administrator of information and regulatory affairs in the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> in a letter Aug. 19 that the proposed rule change `` does not appear to be consistent with several of the administration's basic regulatory principles.'' `` Nor does it appear that the potential benefits to society of this regulation outweigh the potential cost to society,'' <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s general counsel, replied that department officials `` do not agree with the conclusions'' set forth by <PERSON> Plager </PERSON>. `` There are compelling reasons for proposing this rule, including the fact that it may produce benefits to society that outweigh societal costs,'' <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> told <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> in a Sept. 6 letter. Copies of the letters by <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> were provided to The Associated Press. Advocates of the rule change contend that consumers wo n't buy products containing the salvaged material if labels inform them about it. The proposal, which began a 60-day rulemaking procedure Sept. 9, was announced Monday by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. It involves the use of `` mechanically separated'' meat, or <ORGANIZATION> MSM </ORGANIZATION>, although current regulations describe it as MS -LRB- S -RRB- to acknowledge the species of animal involved. Thus, salvaged meat from a hog would be mechanically separated pork, or MSP. According to the plan, which will be open for public comment until Nov. 8, processors would be able to use MS -LRB- S -RRB- to comprise up to 10 percent of the meat in franks, bologna, luncheon meats, sausage and similar products without stating so on product labels. However, the label would have to indicate the percentage of the Recommended Daily Allowance of calcium that the product contained. Calcium is a primary ingredient of bone tissue. Regulations limit the salvaged product to no more than 0.75 percent calcium. But bones are about one-fourth calcium, so that would translate into a maximum of about 3 percent bone. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a private association that represents meat packers and processors, said in a statement that the use of calcium on labels would be `` a more meaningful and useful term'' to consumers than MS -LRB- S -RRB-, particularly to those who have a calcium deficiency and to a few who are allergic to calcium and should be warned away from such products. `` There is no wholesomeness or safety issue involved'' in the MS -LRB- S -RRB- proposal, the institute said in the brief statement, citing the department's own description of the product as `` safe and wholesome as the species from which it is derived.'' But <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> said the assertion that consumers would avoid products labeled as containing MS -LRB- S -RRB- had not been documented in the proposed rule change. `` Furthermore, if one accepts the assertion that some consumers would be reluctant to purchase a product that they know to contain MS -LRB- S -RRB-, why should this information be omitted from the label?'' he said. `` Would its omission, in other words, be inconsistent with the <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- obligation to prevent labels that are ` false or misleading' and, hence, contrary to <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION>' statutory mission to protect the public from misbranded items? <PERSON> Plager </PERSON> said that in seeking ways to carry out less burdensome food safety regulations, `` We must also provide consumers with more, rather than less, information about food products so that they may reach informed market decisions.'' Under current regulations, MS -LRB- S -RRB- can comprise up to 20 percent of the meat portion of these products, but the labels must state that the products contain MS -LRB- S -RRB-. The department said that under the proposed rule change _ which was sought by a group of meat processors and supported by the trade _ MS -LRB- S -RRB- `` would not have to be listed in the ingredients statement on the label as long as it does not exceed 10 percent'' of the meat portion of the finished product. When animals are slaughtered, most of the red meat is cut or scraped from bones by hand. But a lot of edible tissue clings to the bones and gristle, particularly in neck bones, ribs, joints and other hard-to-scrape places. The bones and the attached meat remnants are put through a grinder and forced through fine sieves. Although most of the bones are strained out, the resulting mixture still contains bits of bone about the size of ground pepper. According to the meat processors who asked <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> for the rule change, no company at present is commercially producing MS -LRB- S -RRB- for consumer products because of `` unwarranted negative connotations'' associated with the term MS -LRB- S -RRB-. Under various names, MS -LRB- S -RRB- has been authorized for use in the meat products since 1978 and has undergone numerous legal challenges from consumer groups opposed to the salvaged product itself or labeling requirements.

<HEAD>Pentagon Re-Creates Slice Of Soviet Military Machine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon has re-created a tiny slice of the Soviet military machine to serve as a mobile laboratory for testing American weapons and equipment. The unusual amalgamation of enemy gear is now undergoing its first operational test at <ORGANIZATION> Kirtland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, the Pentagon announced Tuesday. Known formally as the Mobile Integrated Threat Test, the setup replicates `` a key slice of a Soviet Army headquarters and division organization'' and uses real enemy equipment obtained through a variety of means, officials said. Most of the equipment is electronic _ primarily radar and radio gear. But MiG jet fighters also will be used in simulating the `` threat force,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> added in a statement. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military has long conducted tests and experiments with pieces of military equipment made in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and Third World countries and then captured, stolen or covertly purchased. What makes the new effort different is an attempt to combine the radar, radios and targeting equipment into the type of `` integrated'' system that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces would face on a battlefield. Also setting the work apart is the creation of a small organization known as the Defense Test and Evaluation Support Agency that is responsible for operating the gear and playing the enemy. `` We're not re-inventing the wheel; bits and portions of this have been done in the past,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, the director of the Mobile Integrated Threat Test. `` What we're going to offer is the ability to deliver, set up and operate this -LRB- enemy -RRB- gear for testing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> systems. We're trying ... to come close to the real thing The gear we have is not state-of-the-art, but it's still in use within the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' The tests now under way at <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION> are designed to demonstrate that a relatively large network of Soviet equipment can be operated just like the Russians would handle it. Once that goal is accomplished, the support agency will respond to requests from the military services for assistance in checking out the effectiveness of various types of American equipment. The <LOCATION> Kirtland </LOCATION> tests, which will run to early October, will include some flights by Soviet aircraft `` simulating close-air support missions'' as well as flights by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> A-7 attack jets. The A-7s will be used `` to test the capabilities of the Soviet sensors,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` But this is not a traveling road show,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` There wo n't be any dogfights or anything like that. We do n't want to oversell what we're doing.''

 In the battle for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, one of the fiercest fights of all is being waged over defense, with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accusing <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of opposing every military advance `` since the slingshot'' and the Democrat claiming the Republicans have neglected `` our troops in the field'' to pursue a nuclear shield in space. By opposing the MX and Midgetman missiles and ridiculing the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> as `` a fantasy,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has laid himself open to Republican barbs that he would undermine American strength in arms talks with the Soviets. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in turn, has demanded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> explain how he proposes to pay for all the weapons in the Pentagon arsenal. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor has launched a counteroffensive in recent days, visiting an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> plant that makes engines for the Stealth bomber Monday to dramatize his support for that radar-evading plane. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> donned a helmet and rode in a M-1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank at a General Dynamics facility in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where he charged the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration sought to cut tank production by a quarter. `` We'll continue research on strategic defenses, but we're not going to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on a system our best scientists say wo n't work, at a time when we're shortchanging our troops in the field and mortgaging our future,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who also planned a major address on defense in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday. To date, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been on the defensive in arguing that what the American military really needs is a `` conventional defense initiative'' to beef up its front-line forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Far from promising actual cuts in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has suggested any savings on strategic weapons may be offset by the need to buy more tanks, artillery and conventional weaponry. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, has had a field day making the rounds of military plants and bases, pillorying a rival who `` gives me the impression he's opposed to every new weapons system since the slingshot'' and quipping that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` thinks a naval exercise is something you find in the Jane Fonda Workout Book.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has not suggested scrapping a single <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> weapons program, so far has not spelled out how he proposes to keep the $ 289 billion <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget within the constraints of his so-called `` flexible freeze'' on all federal spending save Social Security. Regardless of who wins, the next president will inevitably be faced with hard decisions on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending. `` It's been a dirty little secret of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that for the whole second term the defense budget has undergone real declines,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disarmament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. After doubling in his first four years, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget has fallen 10 percent in real dollars since 1985. It is still 53 percent higher than before the Carter-Reagan buildup. But it would take a major new spurt in spending to get all of the major new weapons off the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s drawing boards and into the field _ or space. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> assistant secretary of defense, said: `` Right now in defense you have a $ 400 billion program and a $ 300 billion budget. Whoever gets in there is going to have to get that program down. ... Something will have to go.'' The Democrats' platform calls for `` more stable defense budgets,'' not cuts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says his top priority `` will be to improve our conventional forces ... while negotiating sensible arms control agreements.'' But building up that conventional strength will not be cheap. <PERSON> Korb </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, estimates it would cost $ 5 billion for each extra day the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wants to be able to fight a conventional war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> against the Soviets. <PERSON> Adelman </PERSON>, now vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> can not save any money like he talks about by cutting down the strategic forces and pouring those funds into conventional forces. There's not going to be that much to pour in. Strategic forces account for at the most 12 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budget. Eighty-eight percent is conventional.'' Military analyst <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said it is <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s figures that do n't add up. `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is talking about trying to drive eight lanes of traffic through a three-lane tunnel as far as the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget is concerned. He has just not realistically faced up to the budget constraints that will be imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, a Brookings senior fellow. `` The extra five lanes are continuing funding at high levels for SDI; following through on plans for a 600-ship <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>; continued modernization of the strategic triad with not one bomber but two, the B-1 and the Stealth; the MX and Midgetman missile; a full Trident submarine program,'' said <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>. `` If you're not prepared to cut some of these glamor programs then things like readiness and training and personnel and maintenance and conventional forces are going to take a beating,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would continue basic Star Wars research at a reduced level of $ 1 billion, less than a third of what is now spent. He opposes a rail-based MX missile system and the Midgetman. He favors scrapping plans to build two new supercarrier task forces that cost $ 18 billion each. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor supports the radar-evading Stealth bomber, which he boasted Monday was `` started by a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> president, it was supported by a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and it's going to be completed by my administration.'' He also favors the D-5 submarine launched ballistic missile. He charges that despite spending nearly $ 2 trillion on defense and increasing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal from 7,000 warheads to 12,000, the Reagan-Bush administration has left <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces short of spare parts and ammunition. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has committed himself to research, testing and deployment of SDI as rapidly as possible _ but he cautioned last month that `` a full deployment ... would be very expensive.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledges to support `` rail mobility for the MX missile.'' He says the single-warhead Midgetman would be `` hard to locate and could enhance stability. However, it is very expensive.''

<HEAD>Air Force Says Most Spectators To Be Moved Away From Shuttle
Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Spectators and journalists in the traditional shuttle launch viewing area have one chance in a thousand of being killed from an out-of-control rocket booster, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. For that reason, said Col. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON>, visitors and more than half the journalists expected for the Discovery liftoff later this month will be placed at a site 6 -LCB- miles away from the launch pad, instead of the usual 3 -LCB- miles. The chance of being killed by an exploding booster at the more remote site is hundred times less _ or, one in 100,000 _ said <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON>, the commander of the Eastern Space and Missile Center at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The Air force is responsible for safety in the entire area which is dotted with launch pads. More than 3,600 members of the news media already have applied for credentials and the total is expected to rise to more than 4,000, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> public affairs chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>. He said all news media who need to be at the close-in press site at the moment of launch will be accommodated, the maximum number being about 1,800. The journalists who will be moved will be those who do n't have immediate deadlines, such as weekly newsmagazines, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. He issued guidelines for credentials: as many as 40 for each of the major television networks, 10 for each wire service, two each for daily newspapers, six each for small television networks, four each for radio networks, three each for individual television stations and two each for individual radio stations. The rest of the credentialed journalists will be put at the remote site, where there are no telephones and only minimal services. The general public, which has turned out a million strong for some past launches on the roads near the Kennedy Space Center, will not be affected because admittance to the center is restricted. The changes were ordered, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said, because the booster rockets did not tumble end over end when the Challenger exploded, but instead continued to fly `` in a missile mode.'' In the case of the Challenger, they went out over the sea. But if they had returned to land, they would have had to be destroyed by command of the range safety officer, scattering shrapnel over the area, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said. `` We can never guarantee absolute safety but we can minimize the risk by minimizing the number of folks,'' said <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a veteran shuttle flight director and chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> risk analysis team said, `` The risk hazard has n't increased since -LRB- the Challenger accident -RRB- ... we understand the risk better.'' Asked if the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was imposing censorship under the guise of public safety, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> replied: `` I believe we are addressing the safety issue.''

<HEAD>House Passes Legislation to Require Federal Licenses for Medical
Labs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Tuesday approved legislation that would for the first time require all medical laboratories _ including nearly 100,000 such labs in doctors' offices nationwide _ to be federally licensed. Such laboratories perform four billion to six billion tests a year for diagnosis and monitoring of disease, and some have been criticized because of rushed procedures that can lead to mistakes. Under the bill, passed on a voice vote, all medical labs would have to meet quality control, personnel and equipment standards and would be subject to penalties for violations. All laboratories would be licensed for two years at a time, would have to pass proficiency tests and would have to meet specific, stringent standards for evaluations of Pap smears which are used to detect cervical cancer. There have been charges that private labs that process thousands of Pap smears daily have been careless in efforts to maximize profits and on occasion failed to spot cases of cancer. Backers of the legislation said there are some 4,500 independent labs in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 6,600 hospital laboratories and 98,000 labs in doctors' offices. The labs would be required to pay issuance and renewal fees for their federal certificates. The measure now goes to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for further action. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has not expressed a position on the bill. Current law subjects hospital and independent laboratories to regulation, but does not affect labs in physicians' offices. The bill would require doctors' - office labs to be certified in order to receive reimbursement for Medicaid and Medicare cases beginning Certain relatively simple tests done in doctors' offices, such as pregnancy tests, diabetes tests and certain urine tests, would be exempted from the legislation.

 The West German government, citing its good ties to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, promised Tuesday to seek freedom for other foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> following the release of a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> businessman. <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, who was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> 20 months ago, was released by his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors late Monday night. The kidnappers seized <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, in January 1987 to try to win freedom for a <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdi </PERSON>, now on trial in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> for the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking and the shooting death of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, an engineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987. Just before freeing <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, the kidnappers said they would now try unspecified legal means to win <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s release, but if that did n't work `` then we shall be obliged to again resort to violence.'' West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said Tuesday that no ransom was paid for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, and no deal was struck. West German officials have also denied that any ransom was paid for <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s release. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said that he had known since Aug. 24 that after months of diplomatic efforts, <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> would be freed on Monday. `` It was one of the best-kept secrets in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>,'' he said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Deutschlandfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio station. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> joined other West Germans in rejoicing over the release of <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also praised <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for helping to get him free. `` The Federal Government is extremely happy over the release of <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meeting. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said good relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> were key elements in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s success in winning <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' freedom. `` Intense contacts with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> were a central point in our efforts -LRB- to gain <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' release -RRB-,'' he said. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> met several times with Iranian officials over recent months urging <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to exert its influence over <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' kidnappers to gain his freedom. West German officials had also been in contact with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which has thousands of troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and has been pressuring Shiite Moslem militants there to release Western hostages. Both <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> pledged <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s help in trying to get other foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> released. Seventeen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are still missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and it is believed most are held by pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> kidnappers. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest held. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. Residents of <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' hometown, the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Fischbach </PERSON>, were jubilant that he was finally coming home. `` And now I have only one wish,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Winfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephan </PERSON>. `` I hope that Mr. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> has been able to withstand the trials of his captivity. That is the hope of everyone here who knows him and his family.''

 `` Pope, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> clash,'' said a headline Tuesday in one South African newspaper. `` <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> in agreement,'' said a headline in another. The conflicting messages reflected the intense battle being waged by South African political factions to capitalize on Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s visit to five neighboring countries. The pope is bypassing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but his comments on issues such as apartheid, sanctions and political violence are being analyzed and interpreted here with great intensity and diversity. Pro-government media seized upon some of the pope's comments en route to <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, on Saturday and suggested that he had repudiated Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. This interpretation was based on the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>'s unqualified denunciation of political violence, and his reservations about sanctions and election boycotts. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> advocates sanctions and is urging a boycott of the upcoming segregated elections. He has repeatedly condemned violence but says he understands how some South African blacks feel they have no other alternative in seeking to end white-minority domination. One pro-government paper, <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION>, ran a cartoon Tuesday showing <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> with a chain of bullets around his neck. `` Is this what your rosary looks like?'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> asks <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, as they stand near a newspaper poster that reads: `` Pope Strongly Against Sanctions and Violence.'' `` It is a pity that Archbishop <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was not in <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION> to hear the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>, since he would have learned what a man of such eminence has to say in leading the faithful on the paths of reconciliation and peace,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government daily, in an editorial Monday. `` But then, the pope is a great religious leader, whereas Archbishop <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> has decided to involve himself in politics.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> also was praised by the state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In a commentary Tuesday, it contrasted his `` forthright declarations'' with the `` vagueness, prevarication and endless qualifications'' from South African clergymen. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, said there are no fundamental differences between the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> and the archbishop, who met earlier this year at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Both oppose violence and agree that strategies such as sanctions and election boycotts should not be used indiscriminately, if other effective tactics were available, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. The papal visit also has prompted ideological maneuvering in Marxist-ruled <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> will travel there Friday on the last leg of his trip. The government-backed newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION>, in a front-page editorial Monday, said the visit to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> proves that the pope sides with `` the peoples of southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' in a struggle against `` the forces of colonialism, apartheid and destabilization.'' The editorial denounced the `` hesitations, ambiguities or collaborationist silence'' of local <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders who have urged the government to change its policy and negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed by voice vote Tuesday a bill setting up a new federal program to try to figure out what to do with the growing number of drug-addicted and AIDS-infected infants abandoned in hospitals. The bill is similar to legislation passed Aug. 5 by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Minor differences between the two measures will now have to be resolved before each chamber votes again and sends the bill to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The House bill authorizes $ 10 million in the next fiscal year for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to develop a program to deal with abandoned infants. Growing numbers of children are being abandoned in big-city hospitals, particularly in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, according to the report accompanying the legislation. But there is no accurate number of abandoned children available. In fact, the legislation directs <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> to survey the program and report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The abandoned babies are children born of mothers who are drug addicts or infected with the AIDS virus. Both those conditions can be passed along to infants.

 Appealing to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to permit thousands of people who were detained in re-education camps after the Vietnam War to leave the country, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to accept up to 94,000 refugees during the next fiscal year. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that number could be reduced to no more than 70,500, in the 1989 fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cuts President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget requests. `` We want to offer the opportunities of a new home in a new land to the masses of unfortunates who need and long for these privileges, as were given to our own forefathers,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> which has jurisdiction over the refugee program. Since October 1981, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has processed and admitted to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more than 400,000 refugees from <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, 200,000 of them from <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the panel. But he noted that, `` for reasons not satisfactorily explained,'' the Vietnamese recently suspended cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on resolving the issues of Americans missing or taken prisoner of war in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the resettlement of Vietnamese who were sent to re-education camps after the war. `` We call upon <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to heal one of the most painful of wounds remaining from the war _ by responding favorably to the wish of thousands of re-education camp detainees to be reunited with their families in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or to come with their families to our country,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` We hope <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> will lift its ` temporary' suspension of cooperation with us on this compelling humanitarian issue,'' he said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said last year the administration set refugee admissions numbers that were higher than the funds made avaiilable for the program by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` This led to confusion and disappointment as the year went on and the money ran out,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> versions of the bill funding the refugee program contain varying amounts. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said that if the final bill provides $ 338.4 million, the same amount as last year, that will be enough money to bring in 68,500 refugees, with funds available from other sources to bring in an additional 2,000. A $ 361.9 million appropriations would pay for resettling 82,000 refugees, with funds avvailable from other federal and private sources to bring in a total 94,000, he said. At the higher level the government would plan to resettle in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 28,000 Vietnamese, including 25,000 Amerasian immigrants, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. He said that level of funding also would permit resettling 24,500 persons from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, 7,000 people from the <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, 3,500 from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> and 2,000 from <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> with 4,000 refugees from all areas to be paid for by private sector contributions.

<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday the opposition has broken terms set by Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the interior minister that talks on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future be held without preconditions. However, government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said he still hoped the talks would take place and be fruitful. And a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> said on state-run television that the talks still could begin within the next few days. No date has been announced for the discussions, which are to consider Solidarity's status in addition to the enormous problems facing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, the Polish <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- party official in charge of propaganda, said the Politburo was informed at its normal Tuesday meeting on preparations for the meeting. `` We believe that if everything goes well, the round table will still take place this week,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. Urban complained that resolutions adopted by the opposition demanded legalization of the trade union Solidarity before the talks begin. `` It was accepted in the talk between -LRB- Interior Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> that talks would be held without preconditions and limits on subjects,'' Urban said at his weekly news conference. `` This arouses justified doubts about whether some of our potential partners at the round table really have a will for dialogue,'' Urban said. Urban was referring to a meeting convened by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brygida </ORGANIZATION>'s church in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> over the weekend, where opposition leaders called on the government to signal its readiness to `` create conditions'' for legalizing the union. However, they did not say they considered it an ultimatum. Solidarity's information commission responded to Urban's comments on Tuesday by saying the spokesman `` distorted the resolutions ... None of the aforesaid statements laid down any preliminary conditions. Urban also said there would be no meeting Wednesday between <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, as proposed by Solidarity officials, to work out remaining obstacles to the talks. But the government spokesman did not exclude a meeting later. `` I can rule out, in fact, that this meeting will be held tomorrow -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- in view of what I have said about the need for certain preparations'' for the full-scale talks, he said. After nationwide strikes, the government agreed to the negotiations on Aug. 31 and promised they would cover Solidarity's future, the broader issue of union pluralism and workers' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> then successfully persuaded strikers to end <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst wave of labor turmoil in seven years to allow the talks to begin The government earlier said that talks would start automatically once the strikes stopped.

 <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATIONS </ORGANIZATION> _ Ten nations have called on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to investigate claims that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used poison gas in an attempt to crush the Kurdish rebellion in its country, an official said Tuesday. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> conveyed the request to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumaida </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Younes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON>, the second-ranking diplomat at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, made the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> request Monday to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> acted on behalf of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The other nations who requested the investigation were <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, she said. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official said Tuesday his country probably would not admit the proposed <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> team to conduct the investigation. `` This is considered a question of sovereignty and therefore I do not think we are going to accept that,'' said the official, who demanded anonymity. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has denied charges that it used poison gas in a bloody offensive against Kurdish guerrillas, a minority people living in northern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> who are fighting for a separate homeland in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> acknowledged on July 1 that it used chemical weapons during its nearly 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but claimed the Iranians had used them first. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` compelling'' evidence that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has used chemical weapons against its Kurdish citizens. But he said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> should conduct its own probe before being asked to condemn <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for alleged genocide. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reached the conclusion <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was using chemical weapons against the Kurds based on an examination of Kurdish refugees in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and on `` other evidence which to me seems to be compelling.'' About 60,000 Kurds recently fled <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, citing poison gas attacks. `` I feel our evidence is quite convincing ...'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. `` But we're not in a position to make that public.'' The evidence led the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Friday to vote for tough economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The measure still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, about 150 Kurds demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office Tuesday, calling for the world body to investigate the alleged gas attacks and shouting `` <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON>, assassin,'' a reference to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` is determined the use of chemical warfare will not become an accepted part of regional conflicts.'' <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> spoke to reporters during a tour of <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> to discuss issues to be considered at the 43rd session of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which convenes Sept. 20 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it wants an investigation partly because of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> evidence of chemical attacks. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it also based its decision on other evidence, including reports from Western journalists in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> who have seen Kurdish refugees they say are suffering from poison gas injuries. However, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> said Friday it found no evidence of the use of chemical weapons while examining sick and injured refugees. In <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that charges of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s use of chemical weapons were `` fallacious.'' In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sanctions, and a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said the accusations against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were groundless. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> concluded in August following an investigation that `` chemical weapons continue to be used on an intensive scale against Iranian forces.'' In March, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> air force dropped cyanide and mustard gas bombs on three Kurdish towns in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, killing 5,000 Kurds and injuring 5,000. The towns targeted by the attack had been captured by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The 1925 <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Protocol bans the use of chemical or biological weapons, although their manufacture and stockpiling is allowed to deter attack.

<HEAD>US Proven Reserves Up Substantially, DOE Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Proven reserves of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil rose surprisingly last year, mainly because oil companies upgraded their estimates of what Alaskan fields can produce, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said the revisions in estimates of existing reserves were the largest ithas ever recorded. Proven reserves amount to oil in the ground that has been measured, and is considered producable with `` reasonable certainty'' with current prices and techniques. Many analysts liken the category to the on-the-shelf inventory in a store. Since the amount recoverable depends on price, with costly-to-produce formations being passed over when prices are low, proven reserves will fluctuate even if additions to reserves just balance production. As of Dec. 31, the department said, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proven reserves were 27.256 billion barrels, up 1.4 percent or 367 million barrels from 26.889 billion barrels recorded a year earlier. Proven natural gas reserves fell 2.3 percent from 191.6 trillion cubic feet to 187.2 trillion cubic feet, continuing the trend of the past six years. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> crude oil reserves increased 503 million barrels with net upward revisions in estimates totaling 535 million barrels before discoveries, other adjustments and production of 718 million barrels. Projects to recover oil normally left in the ground, `` infill'' drilling to increase production from existing fields and better estimates of field performance all contributed to the increases, the department said. In the lower 48 states, reserves decreased 0.7 percent or 136 million barrels with net upward revisions in estimates of 1.353 billion barrels before discoveries, other adjustments and production of 2.155 billion barrels. Large gross upward revisions in reserves also were recorded in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 505 million barrels, and in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 477 million barrels, because of `` enhanced recovery'' efforts to produce oil from existing fields, the department said. Overall <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> reserves increased 7.3 percent from 6.875 billion barrels to 7.378 billion barrels. Lower-48 reserves decreased 0.7 percent from 20.014 billion barrels to 19.878 billion barrels. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> reserves fell 0.5 percent from 4.734 billion barrels to 4.709 billion barrels and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> reserves fell 0.6 percent from 7.152 billion barrels to 7.112 billion barrels. For the country as a whole, discoveries added 691 million barrels to reserves in 1987, 29 percent above the 534 million barrels added in 1986 but 22 percent below the 1977-1986 average. A higher average price for the year, $ 15.41 per barrel vs. $ 12.51 for 1986, enabled oil companies to count more oil in the `` proven'' category, the department said. Prices are now falling, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the principal trade group. Though the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> gain was larger than he expected and the lower-48 decline smaller, he expected, `` the downward trend in reserves over the last four to six years is apparent,'' he said. In only two years since 1980, when reserves were 29.805 billion barrels, have reserves increased, 1984 and 1987. The upward revisions from enhanced recovery projects `` are the result of substantial investments made in the late 1970s and the early 1980s which are just showing up.'' Such investments are now declining, and the consequent lack of production and upward revision in reserve estimates will take a few years to become apparent, <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said.

 Here are excerpts of the speech <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> delivered in a closed session to some members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The text of the speech was released by the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> political group, which invited <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to speak: I realize you have a lot of queries, especially in the light of the historic steadfastness of the Palestinian people as manifested by the uprising of its masses to end the occupation and wrest independence. Granted, they are legitimate queries: It is your right to get clear and specific answers to them from us outlining our overall line of thinking and action, without necessarily going into specific details, especially when they are sensitive. The final decision on these rests with our own parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> ... The intefadeh -LRB- Arabic for uprising -RRB- was an expression of the extent of our people's alertness and their determination to resist the occupation by all means at their disposal, exercising thereby their legal right under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> charter and resolutions. Today, our people are confronting the iron fist policy and the Israeli war machine with stones, children and youths, creating the image of a Palestinian <PERSON> David </PERSON> pitted against a Goliath armed to the teeth with the latest means of warfare and destruction. We had hoped that the sight of children yielding stones to confront armored vehicles, gunfire and suffocating gas would be sufficient to arouse the conscience of the Israeli occupiers and to open their minds to the future, realizing that recognition of the Palestinian people and their right to self-determination and independence is the only road to peace _ away from the massacres and daily killings to which our men, women and children are being subjected and in favor of a future built on peace and justice for all. ... I hereby declare that the people of the intefadeh, the Palestinian people whom I represent, are committed to peace based on justice. Our heritage and culture and our Islam, Christianity and Judaism disallow hatred and repudiate aggression. Inasmuch as they open our minds to peace based on justice, they shape our resolve to defend ourselves, uphold our rights, and resist the occupation. We respect our international commitments. We also respect international legitimacy. At the same time, we believe that a just peace can not be achieved through the selective application of half what international legitimacy provided for and the dumping of the other half. That is why it is imperative that we witness and sense the respect by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration of international resolutions, particularly those upholding the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people's right to self-determination and statehood, and which constitute the cornerstone of the proposed international peace conference ... It would be possible at the said conference and through the negotiations which will take place within its framework to discuss and agree -LRB- on -RRB- arrangements for international guarantees of peace among all states of the region, including the independent Palestinian state. ... We endorse the charter of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> organization and all its resolutions, including 242 and 338. International legitimacy is an indivisible whole and no one can choose to accept only what suits him and discard what does not ... Consequently, we declare our acceptance of one of the two following options as the basis for convening the international conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices and with the participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> permanent members and all parties to the conflict in the region, including the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>: a. All <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions relevant to the Palestine Question, including <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338. b Resolutions 242 and 338 along with the legitimate rights of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people, foremost among which is their right to self-determination. ... In order to create an atmosphere of good will conducive to a just peace, we responded positively _ and still do _ to all proposals calling for the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967 and placing these under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> administration or an internationally supervised <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> force for a limited interim period. The proposed international force could stay on after the establishment of the independent Palestinian state for as long as the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> deems necessary to guarantee the security of everyone concerned. ... We all know of the measures recently adopted by <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> concerning the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> accepted these measures and decided to shoulder the responsibilities resulting therefrom, including the political among them, regardless of the timing and the manner in which the measures were introduced _ without consultation or coordination with us _ and irrespective of the difficulties which we found ourselves facing. The Jordanian measures ended the European, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> debate on Palestinian representation and the international conference. No one can claim anymore that there is someone else to share with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the representation of the Palestinian people, particularly after the cessation of the Jordanian option and the failure of the autonomy option. The only option left is the right, realistic and irreplaceable one - namely, the Palestinian option, the essence of which is the independent Palestinian state ... We are working to set up an independent Palestinian state on the land liberated from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. This state will have a republican, democratic and multi-party system; it will abide by the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and will not discriminate among its citizens on the basis of color, race or religion We are at a crucial stage. The Palestinian state, the key to peace, security and development in the Arab region ... is in the offing.''

 The U.N.-sponsored peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, stalled since they started almost three weeks ago, went into recess Tuesday and will move temporarily to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> hopes to unblock the negotiations at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters there. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediator <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> said both sides accepted an invitation by <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to continue direct talks `` soon'' at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. He said they agreed to return to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> for subsequent meetings. <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> has been presiding over the talks since last week as the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief's personal representative. He said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> invited foreign ministers <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Sept. 22. But the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> delegation said in a statement issued Tuesday night that <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> could not be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> before the first week of October. The statement indicated that acceptance of `` one meeting'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> was conditional on agreeing on a binding date for reconvening the talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> told a news conference earlier Tuesday that both <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> `` seem committed to keep the peace process going'' and both confirmed that they will continue to observe the cease-fire. The truce went into effect Aug. 20 after nearly eight years of fighting and about 1 million dead or wounded. The talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> began on Aug. 25. <PERSON> Eliasson </PERSON> conceded that `` on issues of substance there has been little if any progress'' but said the most important thing at this stage was that `` the peace process is kept alive.'' The talks bogged down over differing priorities. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants them to stick to implementation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> cease-fire resolution 598, starting with withdrawal of `` all forces to the internationally recognized boundaries without delay.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> wants the negotiations to focus first on clearing the <LOCATION> Shatt-el-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, its main link to the sea, and on freedom of negotiation in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got a grim report on the status of the nation's forest fires on Tuesday and was told there is no way to predict when the blazes will be tamed. `` We are fighting with everything at hand,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman met with reporters after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was briefed on the forest fire situation by <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and Deputy Defense Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> at the White House. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> described their session with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as an `` update'' and said there were no new efforts to be announced following the session. `` No one could give a prognosis of when the fires would be put out, but it is clear that we have dedicated all of the resources available and all of our energies, and the goal is the same for everyone _ and that is, put those fires out,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The meeting came as thousands of firefighters continued to battle blazes in eight states, particularly <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. It also followed harsh words on the government's `` let-burn'' approach to the fires from a usually strong <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration supporter, Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, who called the situation `` a catastrophe.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, asked if the president had been given a `` worst-case scenario'' of the devastation in the briefing, shot back, `` We are in the worst case.'' He did note later, however, that some of the officials had expressed `` some cautious optimism'' about prospects for calming the fires. <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> had traveled West to review the situation over the weekend. `` The president has been assured that we have been doing everything possible,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He noted that some 30,000 firefighters were involved in battling 32 fires in eight Western states, with approximately 4 million acres burned. With the most recently dispatched military personnel on station by mid-week, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, some 2,300 soldiers and 22 aircraft had been sent to Yellowstone National Park alone to battle the fires. `` The president has repeatedly expressed his concern for the people living in the fire areas, for the welfare of their families, for their businesses and occupations, and for the hardship that has undoubtedly consumed their lives,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He called the situation `` a natural disaster of unprecendented proportions'' and said the people in the area and government officials `` have responded with great selflessness and determination to get the situation under control.'' `` We will continue to work tirelessly to put out these fires,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> pledged. Earlier in the day, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said he'd not been aware of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> policy permitting some forest lands to burn, and said that the policy has been scrapped. Asked what he thought of the so-called `` let-burn'' policy that has been carried out by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in recent years, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters, `` I have questioned it. I did not even know it existed, frankly.'' Answering questions as he headed back into the Oval Office after signing the fair housing bill, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that when <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> last weekend, `` he made it plain that ... we were withdrawing from this policy.'' Asked how the administration planned to deal with any new outbreaks of fires, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the `` let burn'' policy had been dropped in July and that all new fires would be put out. The spokesman refused to entertain any discussion of the criticism of the administration's controversial policy. But he noted that since the nation has never faced such an outbreak of fires before, the time `` certainly calls for some review of the policy.'' `` It's not a clear case of what's right and what's wrong,'' he said. `` At this point, what's clear is that the fires are out of control. ... We have extraordinary drought conditions and there is no need to argue over policy differences until we come up with the next firefighting season next year. Right now, its all-out, fight-the-fires.'' The government's let-burn policy has been harshly criticized by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members from the Western states. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, speaking to reporters after visiting the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We all knew how dry it was and a lot of us were saying, ` Hey, Do n't let this burn and they could have contained it at that time.''' Some 8,000 firefighters have worked in past days to dampen fires in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where the historic fires have charred 939,270 acres of the 2.2 million-acre park since June. Referring to the damage done to <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> went on: `` Now you have a million acres lost in one of the most important national park areas in the world. ... It's a catastrophe ...'' Without explanation the senator added, `` I suspect it comes from just too much extremism in the environmental area and a lot of our people in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> are very disappointed, very disenchanted about it.'' House Republican leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, emerging from a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders with the president earlier, also said that he had not been aware of the policy. `` This let-burn policy obviously is going to come under review,'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said.

 The hasty departure of seven advisers to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with alleged ties to anti-Semitic activities underscores how firmly <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has taken charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee's campaign, according to top aides. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is a guy who likes to get things resolved,'' said a senior campaign official who spoke only on condition that he not be identified. A top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adviser said the campaign was `` totally blindsided'' by the allegations of anti-Semitic activities, which surfaced last Wednesday as the vice president prepared to address a national B'nai B'rith convention in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Circulated at that convention were copies of an article in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Jewish Week which raised questions about members of the the campaign's ethnic coalition. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that evening and discussed the smoldering controversy, aides said. Tension built over the weekend with a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, a senior <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> operative on the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, had collected information on Jewish officials in the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> in 1971. <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> resigned the same day, saying he was quitting for the sake of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. He acknowledged collecting the data but denied he had anything to do with the Jewish officials' later demotions. Campaign sources said six members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> who resigned had been approached by campaign officials and told of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s resolve to take `` firm and decisive action.'' The situation was spelled out to those involved, said one top official, and they were asked `` what do you folks want to do?'' `` These individuals came to this conclusion -LRB- to resign -RRB- on their own anyway,'' the official said. Five of the ethnic officials resigned Monday. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign announced the sixth resignation on Tuesday, when <PERSON> Radi </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavoff </PERSON> quit as national co-chairman of Bulgarians for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It was accepted. I think we're over it now,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Slavoff </PERSON>'s resignation followed a story in the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Inquirer that identified him as former chief of a Bulgarian group formed after World War II which consisted of members of the Nazi-aligned Bulgarian Legion. The other five resigned after published reports linked them to anti-Jewish or fascist activities. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign sources said they had no plans to replace <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> as deputy Republican national chairman. The resignation of <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> and the six ethnic advisers occurred with a lightning speed that would have been impossible before <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, the former treasury secretary and White House chief of staff, took command of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, aides said. Even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vigorously denied that any of the departing officials were anti-Semitic, the resignations were viewed as a way to distance the vice president quickly from a potentially explosive campaign issue. Those who resigned said they were leaving to avoid any political embarrassment to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, not because there was any substance to the allegations of anti-Semitism. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, speaking Tuesday aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Two, expressed irritation at the allegations, saying: `` We are going through an interesting period here, without hard evidence on various things. I do n't like the allegations about people, and I do n't like it being injected into the campaign.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to say whether <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> would be given a position in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, but said he had `` a lot of confidence'' in <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared Tuesday that `` there is n't one iota of discrimination'' among members of the coalition created to court ethnic votes. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> he believed the ethnic advisers resigned `` because they did n't want to harm the campaign.'' Before <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s arrival, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was managed by a committee of six advisers and marked by frequent squabbles between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign officials and his vice presidential office. Aides said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> quickly established new lines of authority. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the campaign manager, had shared overlapping responsibility for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s overall campaign activities in the past Under <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s reorganization, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> is responsible only for scheduling and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> for political activities, the sources said.

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> Jean-Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> is a hero to the poor and hated by the government, a target of both adulation and assassination for his outspoken criticism of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s military regime The Roman Catholic priest was saying morning Mass last Sunday when 20 to 30 thugs armed with knives, machetes and guns burst into the St. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> church in <LOCATION> Port-Au-Prince </LOCATION> and randomly slaughtered worshipers. Six people were confirmed dead and 77 wounded, witnesses and hospital officials said. Despite the carnage, witnesses said parishioners surrounded the priest and protected him with their bodies, sweeping him to safety and into hiding. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> is perhaps the most popular figure among <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s slum-dwelling masses. During his sermons, in which he vigorously denounced army terror and atrocities, his small, cement-block church in the La Saline slum was regularly packed with exuberant, sometimes hysterical supporters. He has often led them into the streets for demonstrations during periods of unrest. `` Satan is eating us everywhere,'' <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> said of the army during a wave of anti-government demonstrations and harsh repression in June and July of 1987. `` They -LRB- the army -RRB- are the savages. Those who load their guns and shoot our children.'' Since the riots that summer, gunmen in speeding cars have frequently sprayed gunfire at the wall of his church's compound and the homes of other Salesian priests close to <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>. On Aug. 23, 1987, <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> and four other priests were ambushed near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marc </LOCATION> on the main north-south highway 60 miles north of the capital, <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. As they returned from a Mass in memory of a recent peasant massacre, about 40 men armed with machine guns, stones and clubs attacked their car, injuring two of the priests. Soldiers at a checkpoint 70 yards away did not intervene. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> escaped and went into hiding for several weeks following the incident. During a Sunday Mass on Sept. 4, a man entered <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s church with a gun stuck in his belt. The man fled after parishioners wrestled him to the ground and seized the pistol. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s name and those of other opposition leaders are on a `` death list'' of people marked for assassination which has circulated in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, who preaches that Marxism and Christianity are compatible, has not actually called for an armed uprising, but repeatedly advocated the overthrow of the Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s military government by `` active non-violent struggle. The conservative hierarchy of the church has rejected <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>'s `` notion of class struggle. In April the church leadership apparently attempted to <PERSON> rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> of his power base _ the capital's slums _ by transferring him to a remote rural parish north of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. For several days a dozen of his youthful followers occupied the Notre Dame Cathedral in the capital and went on a hunger strike which forced the bishops to rescind their order. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, in his mid-30s, was ordained by his uncle, <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Romelus </PERSON> of the western town of <PERSON> Jeremie </PERSON>, who is the only openly anti-military member of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s 10-member Bishops Conference. Although the bishops have never called for the overthrow of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s government, they issued a statement last month that echoed one made by Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> during a tour of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> in 1983 which said `` things must change'' in the impoverished nation. The statement protested the expulsion of a priest, the assassination of human rights leader <PERSON> Lafontant </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> in July and accused the military government of authoritarian rule and disregard for human life. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s visit helped crystalize public repudiation of the dictatorship of <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, who fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986.

 Two national polls Tuesday found <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pulling past <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the presidential race, and they indicated that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has scored points by pressing the <ORGANIZATION> Pledge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allegiance </ORGANIZATION> as an issue. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by eight points in both national surveys, 47-39 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll and 49-41 percent in a Gallup poll. The Gallup poll found <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> suffering his highest negative rating of the race. Two polls released Monday showed a closer race, but two surveys last week found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> leading by six and eight points respectively. Moreover, the new polls found support for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on underlying issues he has been pressing. On defense, 28 percent of the probable voters in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would make the nation stronger and only 4 percent said he would make it weaker. By contrast, 39 percent said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would make <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defenses weaker, and just 13 percent said he would make the nation stronger. The rest in both cases said defenses would remain unchanged. In another measure, Gallup found that 68 percent of the registered voters it interviewed had heard of the Pledge of Allegiance issue, and by a 2-1 margin they had a less favorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because of it. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in what has become a repeated refrain, has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing legislation in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> requiring teachers to lead classes in the Pledge. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he acted on the basis of a court opinion that the law was unconstitutional, and he accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of impugning his patriotism. But 70 percent in the CBS-Times poll said teachers should be required to lead pupils in the pledge. And half of that group said it should be mandated even if the courts ruled the requirement unconstitutional. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also has been stressing environmental issues, traditionally a strong suit for Democrats, and the <ORGANIZATION> CBS-Times </ORGANIZATION> poll found him ranked nearly evenly with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on protecting the environment. The CBS-Times poll even found backing for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on an issue <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had sought to make his own: competence. Fifty-one percent said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be more competent at managing the federal government, to 32 percent for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Overall, the Gallup survey found 40 percent expressing an unfavorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, up from 32 percent three weeks ago and the highest all year for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in Gallup's poll. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was rated favorably by more voters, 53 percent, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bettered him in both ratings, with 59 percent favorable and 35 percent unfavorable. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' confidence rating suffered in the CBS-Times poll, but in that measure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s score worsened as well. Fifty-nine percent said they would be uneasy with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in an international crisis, up from 53 percent just after the Republican convention last month. Fewer _ 47 percent _ said they would be uneasy with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a crisis, but that was up 10 points from the post-convention poll. Also, 45 percent said they would be confident with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, down from 51 percent; for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 28 percent expressed confidence, little changed from 29 percent. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> continued to lead <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on one other key issue: Forty-seven percent said the Democrat would do more to help the middle class, while 33 percent picked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Finally, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> encountered a low rating on his choice of Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> as his running mate. Fifty-eight percent said they would be worried about <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> stepping in as president if something happened to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and just 32 percent said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was qualified to serve as president. The CBS-Times poll was conducted among 1,043 probably voters from Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The Gallup poll was done Friday through Sunday among 1,003 registered voters and was given a four-point margin of error.

<TEXT>
 A high-ranking official said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is moving many Kurds from small villages for security or better services, but insisted it is not trying to wipe them out or change their style of life. Kurdish rebel groups and others have denounced <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s policy of demolishing small villages and relocating their population. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> suggested on Friday such acts were connected with `` genocide'' against the Kurdish people. But the official, <PERSON> Nizar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamdoon </PERSON>, deputy foreign secretary and former <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said in an interview that the government has no intention `` to change the life of the Kurds.'' Asked about reports of widespread relocations, he said: `` If you're talking about the border area, the reasons are mainly security reasons, so that -LRB- rebel -RRB- infiltration stops. `` With development ... it's more feasible to bring people together to provide better services.'' <PERSON> Hamdoon </PERSON> said some of the Kurdish rebels who were offered amnesty after fleeing to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> would be relocated if they return. `` Obviously, for security reasons we have to relocate some of them ... but they will be provided with a place within <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>,'' he said, refering to the remote northern region of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> where Kurds live. Following a round of fighting that ended in 1975, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> demolished a string of villages along its border with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and moved their people. Over the last year, Baghdad-based diplomats said the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> army demolished scores of other small villages in the mountainous Kurdish territories and moved the people into towns or new concrete apartment blocks along main roads. The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the intention seemed to be to keep closer watch on the Kurds and rob the rebels of village sanctuaries in the rugged mountains. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> grants its 2.5 million to 3 million Kurdish inhabitants a form of regional autonomy, including their own assembly and use of the Kurdish language. Rebel groups demand wider autonomy or creation of an independent state. An additional 6 million Kurds live in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamdoon </PERSON> noted that none of those countries granted the Kurds any form of autonomy. He said the policy of moving Iraqis from remote villages to larger towns is not limited to <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION>. He said similar moves had also taken place in the marshy <LOCATION> Misan </LOCATION> province in the south; the <LOCATION> Kut </LOCATION> region, south of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, and the western deserts. Observers who visited eastern <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> said they saw only a few small villages still standing along the main roads, and many old ones bulldozed. But an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter who recently visited the northern town of <LOCATION> Amadiya </LOCATION>, 12 miles from the Turkish border, said relatively few destroyed villages were visible and several small ones still were standing and populated. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> conveyed to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumaida </PERSON>, on Tuesday a request from 10 nations, including <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> let chemical weapons experts go there to investigate claims that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used poison gas to crush the Kurdish uprising. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denies using gas against the Kurds, but previously acknowledged using chemical weapons against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in their 8-year-old war. An <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official said in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> probably would not admit such a proposed <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team as a matter of sovereignty.

<TEXT>
 The man who predicted all the faithful would be called to heaven by Tuesday morning, leaving a warring world of non-believers, has revised his prediction. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> now believes a process called the Rapture will begin at 9:55 a.m. CDT Wednesday, said <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio station <ORGANIZATION> KAAY </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> will not consent to interviews with the secular press, Mrs. <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> said. Calls to <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>'s Rapture 88 Ministries in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION> were greeted by an answering machine, and <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> did not return a call to The Associated Press. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>, 56, a retired civil engineer and self-taught Bible student, has predicted on broadcasts carried by more than 90 radio stations nationwide that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> would `` rapture the church'' _ take the faithful to heaven _ on Sept. 11, 12 or 13. Mrs. <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> said she spoke with <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> on Monday. `` I wanted to nail down when he felt like was the last possible moment before the rapture,'' she said. That's when she discovered <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON>'s revision. `` All through this, <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> has been basing things on <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> time because he feels like God's heart is in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> was reminded Monday of Bible teachings that the rapture will not occur until the last trumpet blast on earth signaling the end of <LOCATION> Rosh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashana </LOCATION>, the Jewish new year, Mrs. <PERSON> McArthur </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Whisenant </PERSON> figures the last trumpet blast will occur along the international date line, and that will signal Christians that they are about `` to meet the Lord in the clouds,'' she said. `` As best he can calculate it, that looks like 9:55 a.m. Wednesday.''

 Seventy-five days after he set sail, and 44 days after he was reported missing at sea, <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> returned to dry land Tuesday with new respect for canned food and the Coast Guard. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, man had planned to sail his 32-foot wooden sloop from <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Oahu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. He left in late June expecting to arrive by late July. `` I'm not an old salt or anything like that, but I'm not a novice,'' he said. On July 31, his family reported him missing. `` I'm married, but I did tell my wife before I left not to call the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. I told her it takes a long time to get anywhere,'' he said during a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> minutes after he reached land here in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I have n't called her yet.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' plans went astray shortly after he left. He headed south, then turned west at 16 degrees north latitude to swing over toward <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` And then a storm came along and blew me south and to the west of <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>,'' he said. Because of prevailing wind patterns, `` I could n't come back -LRB- northeast -RRB- to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> against the wind, so I decided to come back to the mainland.'' With his radio batteries dead, he slowly worked his way through a small stock of canned food and vitamins. He dragged a line in hopes of catching fish, but `` I guess I'm not much of a fisherman.'' He had n't had a chance to weigh himself yet, but guessed he lost 20 to 25 pounds. Early Sunday, when he was just 100 miles off <LOCATION> Eureka </LOCATION>, a large storm came up and ripped away his hatch cover. `` Everything was in a shambles inside and I was having a hard time keeping the water out,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. Then another sailboat came along and called the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on its radio. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter flew out a portable generator to power <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' radio and some rations. Then a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> boat towed him into <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> was really wonderful, and I ca n't say enough about them,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. He is n't ready to give up sailing just because of one misadventure. `` I love the sea, and this has n't changed me so far as I want to give it up,'' he said. `` I feel healthier since I've sailed. Life in the city is n't good for you.''

The governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, he lost his top naval adviser last week. His rubber duck drowned in his bathtub.'' <PERSON> GEORGE </PERSON> <PERSON> BUSH </PERSON>, attacking <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan for a federally funded, regional job-creation and economic development program: `` All you need to do is to make a small down payment, $ 500 million, to get those industrial planning technocrats to work in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. My opponent calls this kind of government ` the helping hand.' Well, where is the helping hand reaching? Right for the wallet.'' PRESIDENT <PERSON> REAGAN </PERSON>, railing on the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> proposal to reimburse providers of child care who meet federal standards: `` And that means if you want to leave your child with his grandmother during the day, she will have to be licensed under federal standards if she's to be given assistance for helping to raise her grandhild.

<HEAD>Fighting Leaves More Than 100 Salvadorans Dead or Wounded</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EL PARAISO, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 100 Salvadorans were killed or wounded in fighting between rebels and troops and in clashes between students and riot police Monday and Tuesday, officials, witnesses and news reports said. About 150 leftist rebels attacked the garrison at <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> 4th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>, shortly after 1 a.m. Tuesday with mortars and small arms fire. A two-hour battle left nine soldiers and seven guerrillas dead, according to Col. <PERSON> Ciro </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON>, garrison commander. He said 12 soldiers and an undetermined number of rebels were wounded. Col. <PERSON> Galileo </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, head of the armed forces press office, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview that government forces inflicted 50 casualties on guerrillas in northern <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> province between late Monday and shortly before dawn Tuesday. No breakdown of dead and wounded was given. <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chalatenango </LOCATION> are the two of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 14 provinces where guerrillas maintain a constant presence, move freely and administer some towns and villages. In the capital, about 300 riot troops clashed with approximately 3,000 university students marching to the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to demand increased government spending on education. The helmeted troopers, some carrying assault rifles and others toting plastic shields and nightsticks, fell in behind the marchers and continuously prodded, shoved and insulted the demonstrators. When one student turned to confront them, he was beaten by several troopers. A melee ensued, with sporadic pistol and rifle fire resounding through the streets for nearly 30 minutes. The troopers fired tear gas to disperse the demonstrators. Officers on the scene said urban commandos of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> fired pistols from within the crowd of demonstrators. Reporters saw more than 200 demonstrators arrested and shoved into buses. Several were bleeding from beatings. A riot trooper told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> a policeman was killed by fire from the demonstrators. The riot troops shoved and insulted journalists, fired bursts low over their heads and forced them to lie face-down on the pavement. `` Do n't move!,'' one shouted at the prostrate reporters. `` This is what you get for only telling lies!'' The National Police, contacted by the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, declined immediate comment on the clash in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. In the western provincial capital of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, troops of the 2nd Infantry Brigade tangled with local university students marching to demand a bigger budget. The independent radio station <ORGANIZATION> KL </ORGANIZATION> reported from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> that gunfire wounded two students and two soldiers, that 20 demonstrators were beaten and an undetermined number were arrested. At <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paraiso </LOCATION>, reporters were shown the bodies of six guerrillas on the base's soccer field. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roque </PERSON> said the body of a woman guerrilla was found about a half-mile from the base. Troops were still mopping up around <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Gigante </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> outside <LOCATION> Perquin </LOCATION>, 125 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, as of midday, <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said. There was no way to immediately confirm the official casualty figures. Early this month, the military press office said 25 guerrillas were killed during combat around Tejutepeque in central <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Reporters who went to the scene found four rebels killed. Precise casualty figures are hard to pin down as the guerrillas make every effort to remove their dead from the battlefield. Five soldiers were wounded in the <LOCATION> Morazan </LOCATION> fighting, <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> said reporters would not be taken to the combat zone since helicopters ferrying wounded soldiers and supplies came under guerrilla fire hours after the fighting stopped.

<HEAD>Dukakis Doubts Bush Could Deal With Gorbachev; Bush Talks Recovery</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: EDITS and UDPATES throughout to include new poll results and
Bush comments on latest resignation, and to tighten.
^By DAVID ESPO</NOTE>

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> questioned on Tuesday how <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be able to deal with Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` if he could n't stand up to the ayatollah or say ` no' to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The vice president preached the gospel of Republican prosperity and said <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a `` rising nation again.'' <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> got off the snappiest one-liner of the day when he announced to a <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> audience that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had lost his top naval adviser. `` His rubber duck drowned in his bathtub,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in another in a series of comments designed to undercut the Democratic candidate's foreign policy and defense credentials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned as two new national polls found <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pulling ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by eight points. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> led by 47 percent to 39 percent in a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll and 49 percent to 41 percent in a Gallup poll. Gallup found results from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attacks on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law requiring teachers to lead students in the Pledge of Allegiance. The poll said 68 percent of the registered voters it interviewed had heard of the Pledge of Allegiance issue, and by a 2-1 margin they had a less favorable view of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because of it. The Republican campaign was buffeted with more controversy when the co-chairman of `` Bulgarians for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' resigned after being identified in a newspaper report as the former head of a Nazi-aligned group formed in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> after World War II. <PERSON> Radi </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavoff </PERSON> became the sixth person to resign from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ethnic organizations over allegations of anti-Semitic activities. Top <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> also resigned Sunday after it was reported that he had conducted a survey under orders from then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> of top <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> officials to see how many of them were Jewish. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed irritation at what he called the lack of `` hard evidence on various things.'' Although he refused to say whether he would hire <PERSON> Malek </PERSON> in a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the vice president expressed confidence in him. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in remarks before <PERSON> Slavoff </PERSON>'s departure had been announced, said he was sure the vice president's campaign had n't suffered from any appearance of anti-Semitism He added he was certain `` because I know -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- and I know the people involved and there is n't an iota of discrimination in any of them.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy on questions of bigotry is to `` ignore the shame'' and blame the opposition. The new polls came on the heels of two surveys providing snapshots of a close presidential race with eight weeks remaining. One survey indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was leading, but by less than the poll's margin of error The other indicated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> led, but also by less than the margin of potential error. The image was thus of a race still forming, with the outcome likely to be heavily influenced by two presidential debates in late September and mid-October, as well as by an early October confrontation between <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> executives said Tuesday the network has reversed its decision and will carry the first presidential debate live on Sept. 25, interrupting prime-time coverage of the Summer Olympics. The other major networks said earlier they would cover the debate as it occurred. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> made their way through large battleground states during the day. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, hoping to bolster his standing as a candidate knowledgable about foreign policy, offered his view of U.S.-Soviet relations, criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and invoking the optimistic rhetoric of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` Civility is not a sign of weakness and sincerity is always subject to proof,'' he quoted the last president from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would challenge <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to reach additional arms control accords and to open the Eastern bloc to more freedom. He said Republicans `` are content to leave the intiative on arms control and regional disputes and the spread of advanced weapons systems around the world to Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. We are not.'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a long time, but if he could n't stand up to the ayatollah or say ` no' to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, how will he measure up to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations. That was a reference to the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government dealings with <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who is under indictment on drug charges. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> later went to a tank factory in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where he donned a helmet and rode in an M-1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank for the benefit of television cameras. He recalled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement last year that Soviet tank workers would be useful in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, and he said, `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, I'd rather have mechanics from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.'' As for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> noted that since World War II, three vice presidents have moved into the Oval Office without being elected president. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. He's no <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. And he sure ai n't <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>,'' the Democratic presidential candidate said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> countered on his running mate's behalf: `` Is n't it interesting that the top of the ticket has to be shooting at the vice presidential nominee now.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his way from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> during the day _ states accounting for 82 electoral votes of the 270 needed for victory _ as he stressed the economic recovery of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. Scorning <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as the governor from `` Taxachusetts,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> depicted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and the Democrats as `` prophets of pessimism.'' He told the <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, `` Americans at every income level are certifiably better off than they were in 1981. So the next time somebody tells you that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is declining, tell'em to put away the 1980 calendar, this is 1988. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a rising nation again.'' The CBS-Times poll was conducted among 1,043 probably voters from Thursday through Sunday and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The Gallup poll was done Friday through Sunday among 1,003 registered voters and was given a four-point margin of error.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee is seeking another $ 550,000 to pay the outside counsel hired by the panel in July to investigate allegations against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. The committee's contract with the special counsel, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>, provides that he will be paid not more than $ 300,000 plus expenses. But Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the committee, said Monday that based on costs for professional services provided by <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s law firm through Aug. 31, the committee will exceed the $ 300,000 limit before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns next month In a letter to Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Annunzio </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the extra $ 550,000 will ensure that `` there will not be any financial impediment to the efficient completion of the preliminary inquiry'' into the allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he was prohibited by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules from disclosing `` the status, progress or projected completion date'' of the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> investigation, but he said <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON>'s law firm has six attorneys working on the case full time and other attorneys working part time, `` all of whom are compensated at an hourly rate of $ 125.'' The ethics committee, formally known as the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, initially received a $ 400,000 appropriation for fiscal 1988. After the panel hired <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> to conduct the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved an additional $ 350,000 for the panel. The committee, acting on a complaint filed by Rep. <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON>, R-Ga., voted in June to launch an investigation into six allegations against <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, including charges that he used his office improperly to lobby federal officials and others on matters in which he had a financial interest The investigation also is focusing on alleged improprieties in the publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received unusually high royalties. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that he will be cleared by the investigation.

 Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> on Tuesday welcomed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to pay in full its <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> financial arrears, but added that the world body needs more money and still faces a financial crisis. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials had said that without the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payment, the organization would have run out of funds in October and would be forced to use money meant for salaries to finance a peacekeeping force in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told reporters as he left <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Headquarters </ORGANIZATION>, `` It -LRB- the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision -RRB- is a very positive development which I very much welcome and which alleviates our difficulties. `` Of course, it is not the end of our financial problems, but it will alleviate them very much.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the biggest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contributor and is assessed one-quarter of the annual regular budget of about $ 800 million. It has withheld funds for years to protest what it called the organization's political bias and to compel it to institute budgetary, political and administrative reforms. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said that because of the payment, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would `` feel much more comfortable'' when he addresses the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> Sept. 26, but added that the president `` is always welcome.'' He said he hoped other nations also would pay their arrears to the 159-member organization. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> statement on July 31 said 73 nations owe money. On Tuesday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> authorized immediate release of $ 188 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. He also directed the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to work on a plan for settling all past debts of $ 520 million.

<TEXT>
 Residents along the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday braced for the possible onslaught of Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which ripped through <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> with winds of 140 mph before taking aim at the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, oil companies evacuated thousands of workers from rigs in the gulf, and residents along the coast awaited word on whether <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> would become the second storm to hit them in a week. And on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, oil futures prices moved up a bit Tuesday, driven by a rise in gasoline prices spurred by concerns about the effects of the hurricane. `` Oh man, business is really booming,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, an assistant manager at a <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` We've got people all over the place right now buying flashlights, batteries, lamp oil _ everything `` It's very steady and they're not just coming in getting a handful of stuff _ it's cartloads of stuff.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, which could hit the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by Thursday, reached Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength. The scale lists such a storm as causing catastrophic damage and having a storm surge of greater than 18 feet. `` Everyone's buying plywood,'' <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> Burge </PERSON>, an assistant manager at <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Building </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION>, said. `` It's escalating at this time and it does n't look like it's going to slow down. Our business easily has doubled since yesterday.'' `` Everybody is on standby,'' added <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandewalli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> disaster chairman for the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` No matter where it hits, we're going to get something.'' Ms. <PERSON> Vandewalli </PERSON> said no shelters would be set up on <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and if an evacuation was ordered, people would be sent to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, about 45 miles to the north, and to shelters planned north of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> as far away as <LOCATION> Conroe </LOCATION>, nearly 90 miles inland. `` It is not safe to be on the island,'' she said, explaining why no shelters would be established on <LOCATION> Galveston </LOCATION> before the storm. Elsewhere along the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION>, emergency preparedness officials were meeting to plan for the possibility of a storm and to decide if and when evacuations would be ordered. In <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, where last week, Hurricane <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION> blew ashore, oil company officials said they were n't taking any chances with crews at sea. The storm was moving to the northwest about 15 mph. `` We began evacuating our offshore drilling personnel yesterday and we're finishing that up today,'' <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Vehnekamp </PERSON> said. Other companies were following suit. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Graves </PERSON>, marketing director for <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, said his company's 18 bases in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> region were operating at full capacity evacuating the rigs. He estimated that all the 10,000 or so workers who normally work the gulf would be evacuated by Wednesday. `` I do n't think anybody's going to ride this one out, that I'm sure of,'' he said <PERSON> Vehnekamp </PERSON> said many workers had not yet returned to Gulf rigs following evacuations before Hurricane Florence hit the southeast <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> coast last weekend. While the oil industry was gearing up for the storm, residents in areas along the south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> coast were monitoring the storm's progress. `` People have been watching this storm since it was a depression and they'll be watching it until it comes through,'' said <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> <PERSON> Picou </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, civil defense director in <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. `` It's too early for us to be doing anything about it,'' he said. `` Our action will begin tomorrow. `` Believe me though, you wo n't have to tell anyone in <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION> what to do about it if it comes.''

 Christian militiamen kidnapped the defense minister Tuesday but freed him three hours later under pressure from the army. The incident worsened a political crisis that could reignite <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. Police said the kidnappers, members of the Lebanese Forces militia, released <PERSON> Adel </PERSON> <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON>, 83, at 2:40 p.m. after the army command threatened to storm an apartment building in which he was being held in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman said Moslem and Christian militiamen traded automatic rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line after the Shiite Moslem minister's abduction The spokesman, who can not be identified in line with standing regulations, said at least two gunmen were killed and two wounded in the fighting, which he described as a `` localized'' incident. He said the commander of the Lebanese Forces, <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, received Osseiran after his release and `` apologized to him for the behavior of the unruly militiamen.'' `` We denounce such acts in our areas, especially when they target a personality like <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON> who is one of heroes of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s independence,'' <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast by radio stations in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The silver-haired Osseiran drove from east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the Alumni Club of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> in the city's Moslem sector for lunch after his release. The minister, wearing a dark gray suit, told reporters his captors took him to a ninth-floor apartment in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ashrafiyeh </LOCATION> district `` They prepared coffee for me,'' he said. `` As a matter of fact, I can say that I enjoyed meeting these people.'' <PERSON> Osseiran </PERSON> said in English that the kidnappers were members of the Lebanese Forces from the Christian town of <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The kidnappers had offered to trade Osseiran for a Christian parliament deputy, <PERSON> Farid </PERSON> <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON>, who they claimed was kidnapped Thursday in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said gunmen seized Osseiran in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at a checkpoint near the Green Line manned by the Lebanese Forces and took him to their headquarters. An hour later, army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a Christian, ordered his 42,000 troops on alert and warned the kidnappers to release Osseiran `` at once.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has long been at odds with the Lebanese Forces over their growing dominance of east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the Christian heartland north of the capital that has eroded the authority of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s divided government. The Lebanese Forces claim <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped by pro-Syrian militiamen of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> at a checkpoint south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as he drove to <LOCATION> Jezzine </LOCATION>. They said <PERSON> Serhal </PERSON> was being kept at west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> hotel `` against his will.'' Osseiran's abduction heightened tension between Moslems and Christians during a political deadlock in efforts to elect a new president. Moslem factions and Christians have been fighting a civil war in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for 13 years, ravaging the economy and leaving more than 130,000 dead. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is the main power broker, maintaining 40,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. In the southern port city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, fighting broke out Tuesday between two local Sunni Moslem factions. Police said one person was killed and seven were wounded.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has authorized the release of $ 188 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues payments to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and has directed the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to work on a plan for settling all past debts, the White House announced Tuesday. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters in a late afternoon briefing that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to work out `` a multi-year plan'' for paying a grand total of $ 520 million in current and late <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dues payments to the world body. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> also has $ 111.8 million in past due payments separately to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping fund. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> `` has reformed its operations to the point'' where <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> felt he could act. `` The president will release $ 44 million, which was withheld in fiscal 1988, and $ 144 million which was withheld in fiscal 1989. He will request full funding of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' in Fiscal 1990, which amounts to approximately $ 476 million,'' he said. The $ 44 million will be released immediately, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, while the $ 144 million that had been earmarked in Fiscal 1989, beginning Oct. 1, will be set free as funds become available. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told reporters as he left <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision `` is a very positive development which I very much welcome and which alleviates our difficulties. Of course, it is not the end of our financial problems, but it will alleviate them very much.'' In an earlier statement written on his behalf, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said, `` Until the outstanding contributions by all member states are paid, the organization will continue to operate with inadequate current income and virtually without reserves.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> required the president to determine that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had made reforms, `` including cutbacks in the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- secretariat, the hiring of temporary employees'' and improved budgeting procedures. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was convinced that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had made progress in instituting reforms and that the president noted the increasing peacekeeping role of the world body in such hot spots as <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, he said, is `` serving important longterm interests'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in these troubled regions. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to release a portion of the funds owed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> immediately `` makes clear that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is ready to meet its obligations.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s actions breathe new life into our hopes for world peace'' by enabling the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> to fund peacekeeping operations `` I do, however, deeply regret that this administration has found it necessary to wait to act until the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is near the brink of financial disaster and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credibility has been severely damaged,'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member who has urged increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leadership on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> issues, said, `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> decision appears to signal a new era of cooperation rather than confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. The only question is whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has the vision and the fortitude to reverse course and follow the president's lead.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' regular <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> dues assessment amounts to a quarter of the money in the body's budget. And the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also is assessed 31 percent of the peacekeeping costs. `` We have seen in the last six months some important reforms in terms of the budget and hiring practices, and so forth, and so that has been a determining factor,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He also credited the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> with being `` an important factor'' in getting Soviet troops to withdraw from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and he said there had been an improvement in the political environment in the world body where American interests are concerned. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to visit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for two days later this month, and will address the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 26. He also will meet with a number of foreign leaders while in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` During the seven and a half years of this administration, the president has sought to change the political environment,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` Although the reform is incomplete, the progress is striking,'' he said, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been demanding more accountability from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for the money it spends. The aim, he said, was to `` prod the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to become an even greater force for peace throughout the world.'' `` In announcing these decisions, the president called on the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to continue progress in areas where reform remains incomplete,'' the spokesman said. `` The president reiterated the commitment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to assist the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> in its reform program as well as in its new peacekeeping efforts.'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, had said in late July that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> hoped to pay $ 188 million of its debt to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> ations before the year was out to help prevent the world body from running out of money at a time of heightened peacekeeping activities. Testifying July 29 before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said that if progress were reached at resolving such world problems as Soviet occupation of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> presence in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, a transition to independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> could face an annual peacekeeping bill of more than $ 1.5 billion. `` All of these are important to the interests of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and all are likely to involve the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> significantly,'' he said at the time. `` This increase in activity takes place at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> is facing a very tight cash situation.''

 Dealing with his first major hurricane as director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON> was n't skipping a beat Tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questions at him Sheets, who was acting director during the 1987 <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season and was named director in March, spent most of the morning on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large monitor showing the destructive Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> sprawled across much of the western <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>. His schedule of interviews was timed to the minute. But Sheets, rosy-cheeked and good-natured, did n't so much as flinch in his seat. After all, he noted, `` I've flown into 200 hurricanes ... I really do n't think this is difficult.'' The transition from former Director <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, widely known for his distinctive style and flattop haircut, to Sheets, his dark blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a gray wool-blend jacket, has been a smooth one. `` He knows his job very well and he's a calm personality,'' <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON>, the center's budget analyst, said of Sheets. On days with active tropical weather, Ms. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> steps in to coordinate media interviews. And interest in <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> has been high since it started packing hurricane-force winds over the weekend and by Tuesday afternoon became a Category 5 storm with winds of 160 mph and a central pressure of 26.66 inches. A Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength has winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure less than 27.17 inches and has the potential for causing catastrophic damage. `` This would be considered a ` Great Hurricane,' `` said Sheets. `` It's certainly in the top 10 percent as far as intensity, size and destructive potential.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was being compared to the hurricane of 1935, which slammed into the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> and killed 600 people, and Hurricane Camille, which devastated the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> coast in 1969, killing 256. Those are the only Category 5 storms which have made landfall this century. The last major hurricane to make landfall was <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> in 1985, along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION>. The major television networks, local stations and newspapers media were on hand to monitor the hurricane, which could reach the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by Thursday, said Sheets. From there, it's anybody's guess where it will go, he said `` It's a brand new ball game as far as the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is concerned,'' said Sheets. The center's 33-member crew, including seven hurricane forecasters and specialists, are keeping a close watch of the hurricane in a large, open room of blue monitors flickering with color and non-color graphics. And while Sheets might appear to be spend most of his day with tiny microphones snaking down his back for TV interviews and fielding questions, he also writes most of the hurricane advisories issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts. Dealing with a major hurricane is n't much different from dealing with smaller ones or tropical storms, Sheets said, adding that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> has been particularly `` well-behaved.'' `` It does what we think it's going to do ... You feel a lot more confident about what you're doing than with weaker systems,'' he said.

 Freed hostage <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> arrived home in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> Tuesday night, ending a 20-month ordeal at the hands of Shiite Moslem kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was accompanied by his wife and German envoys who flew to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, after his release late Monday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the 55-year-old businessman said, `` I feel I'm born again.'' A twin-engine West German military jet carrying the couple arrived at the <LOCATION> Cologne-Bonn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> at 10:20 p.m. -LRB- 4:20 p.m. EDT -RRB- after a five-hour flight from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>. The plane taxied to the military area of the <LOCATION> Cologne-Bonn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> airport </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was greeted by West German authorities. The couple then was taken to an undisclosed location in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. He is to have a medical examination and is expected to be debriefed by security officials. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> hugged his tearful wife, <PERSON> Marlene </PERSON>, and the couple was escorted by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> security officers to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and turned over to West German officials. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> he nearly despaired during the ordeal and he saw none of the other 17 foreign hostages missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. `` There were moments during which I was feeling so terrible. But now that I am a free man again, that I am joining my family, everything seems so far away,'' he told a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm rejoicing for being a free man again. I feel I'm born again. It is as if I have been granted a new life. I am feeling perfect, and I'm in a very good shape,'' he said in German as he greeted <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s German State Minister for Chancery Affairs <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> who arrived to escort him home. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, speaking on West German TV, said <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> told him his kidnappers `` treated him humanely, but the conditions were hard, he was always isolated and was always chained. `` He was moved often and was in a continuous state of uncertainty. He told me he received few letters from his relatives.'' <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was not able to identify the kidnappers because they wore masks in his presence. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Hoechst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> pharmaceutical company, was freed in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at midnight Monday, escorted to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> by Syrian officers and spent the night at a government guest palace. There was no further information about the reported abduction and escape of an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> engineer identified as <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON>. Various reports said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was abducted Sunday by gunmen in eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after he married a Lebanese woman. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washingotn </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> subdued his abductors, reached a Syrian army checkpoint and was escorted to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> where he was turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. They said <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> was employed in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> for <ORGANIZATION> Litton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> but they did not know his hometown. Neither Syrian nor <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials would comment on the case Tuesday and <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> could not be located. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Jan. 17, 1987, by Shiite Lebanese extremists who were seeking to swap him for an Arab jailed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on terrorist charges. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, 24, is being tried in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> on murder and air piracy charges in the 1985 hijacking a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed during the 17-day ordeal. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, was sentenced to 13 years in prison in April after he was convicted of kidnapping <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> and another German, <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in January 1987 to try and exchange them for <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, an engineer, was freed Sept. 7, 1987. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, a West German government spokesman who demanded anonymity said he knew of no deal with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or with the kidnappers for <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' freedom. The government has repeatedly denied it paid a ransom for <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>'s release. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> appeared healthy, smiled all the time and spoke confidently. Asked at the news conference if he had seen any of the other 17 foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, he said in English: `` I have n't seen any hostages I was alone.'' Speaking slowly in a trembling voice, Mrs. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>, said in English: ` It is wonderful. I could n't wait for it to happen _ that our life becomes normal again. It is smashing, so exciting I can not believe it is really happening.'' <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON>' captors, a group calling itself the Holy Warriors for Freedom, said in a statement Monday that they were freeing him in response to Iranian and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> intervention. The statement did not elaborate. <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> was reunited with his wife about two hours before he was turned over to the German officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. `` She fell into his arms and they kissed each other for a long time,'' an official who witnessed the reunion said. Syurian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sharaa </PERSON> said: `` On behalf of President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> I express how glad that he -LRB- <PERSON> Cordes </PERSON> -RRB- is released and going back home.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> maintains about 40,000 troops in east and north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as well as Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It has been trying to secure the release of the foreign hostages most of whom are held by <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. It is believed that most of the 17 foreigners still missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are held by pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> kidnappers. Longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 40, was kidnapped in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985.

 A recount began Tuesday of ballots cast in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>'s Democratic primary for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, after the discovery of a clerical error that incorrectly tallied 2,800 votes. The <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> conducted its recount Tuesday and recounts were scheduled Wednesday in the state's other two counties. The Kent County board recertified its ballots when the recount determined nothing had changed. `` We have no change in the results. It's over in <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrington </PERSON>, administration director of the board of elections. The recounts were requested by both candidates, civic activist and millionaire <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> and Lt. Gov. S.B. Woo. They are seeking their party's nomination to challenge incumbent Republican <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is seeking a fourth term. <PERSON> Roth </PERSON> did not have a primary opponent. Beard was declared the winner in Saturday's voting, but election officials discovered early Monday that he had been given 2,800 votes too many. Saturday's results showed Beard with 22,418 votes to Woo's 19,624 By Monday night, the unofficial statewide tally showed Beard trailing by 88 votes, with 20,133 votes to Woo's 20,221. Those figures included certified results from <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> counties, which had changed slightly from the counties' reports Saturday night. The 2,800-vote mistake occurred in the 23rd representative district in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where about 280 Democrats are registered. Beard received 28 votes in the district, but the votes were recorded as 2,828 in the computer at the county's department of elections, according to <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, administrative director of the county Department of Elections. Woo, 51, a physics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, was a political newcomer when he was elected lieutenant governor four years ago. The native of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, had heavy financial backing from Asian-Americans nationwide. Woo heavily outspent Beard, a millionaire who inherited his wealth. Beard, 49, had the backing of party loyalists and labor. He has served as chairman for job creation commissions under the past four presidents.

 Three prominent anti-apartheid activists, detained for more than a year without charge, escaped from a hospital Tuesday and took refuge at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulate </ORGANIZATION> in a high-rise office building. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said it had `` high regard'' for the men and would not force them to leave against their will. Two of the three are senior officials of the now-banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> _ acting publicity secretary <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON>, a black, and acting general secretary <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, an Indian. The other is <PERSON> Vusi </PERSON> <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, a black who was chairman of the banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> statement confirmed that the three had taken refuge at the consulate, on the 11th floor of an office building in downtown <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The building is two miles from the hospital where they were being treated. The main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy is in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Several associates of the escapees later met with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> and they said he assured them the men would be well cared for. The three have asked to meet with their relatives and with leaders of the anti-apartheid movement, but they have not disclosed any other requests. `` We were in frequent contact with these three men prior to their detention without charge, and hold them in high regard,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement said. `` We will not press them to leave against their will.'' The statement said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not offer asylum at its diplomatic offices. But it said these premises are inviolable under international law and may not be entered by the host government without consent. The embassy said it was discussing the situation with the activists and the South African government. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, an anti-apartheid labor leader, said he and several colleagues including <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> conferred with <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first black ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and they were assured the escapees' physical needs would be cared for <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> said of the three, `` They're very pleased to be where they are.'' Brig. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Law and <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the men had escaped from <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where they had been receiving physiotherapy. No details of the escape were disclosed. Previously, the three had been at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s Diepkloof Prison. At the consulate, there was no visible sign of security force deployments. A private guard stood at the entrance while about two dozen journalists waited in the hall for several hours before dispersing. <LOCATION> Morobe </LOCATION>, 32, and <PERSON> Valli </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON>, 31, were detained in July 1987 after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared June 12, 1986. <PERSON> Khanyile </PERSON>, 37, was detained in December 1986. Between the emergency declaration and his detention, <PERSON> Morobe </PERSON> operated from underground, wearing disguises and showing up unannounced at newspaper offices. As one of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s most eloquent writers and speakers, he played a key role in conveying the positions of the nation's largest anti-apartheid group, at a time when most of its leaders were in jail or in hiding. An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge at some point during the emergency. The government has not released comprehensive statistics, but it said recently that 802 people who had been held at least 30 days were still in custody. Many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide coalition of more than 600 anti-apartheid groups. Also detained were virtually all top leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition of parent, teacher and student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum and policies in their schools. The committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts that spread nationwide in 1985-86. But when it subsequently campaigned for `` people's education,'' the government outlawed it. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the crisis committee were among 17 anti-apartheid organizations banned in February from conducting any activities. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government was among many to condemn these bannings. Twice in recent years, activists have taken refuge at diplomatic missions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Six <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leaders stayed at the British Consulate in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> for several weeks in late 1984 before emerging to face arrest for high treason. The charges later were withdrawn. In September 1987, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to let a Dutchman, <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonge </PERSON>, return to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> after being holed up at a <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> for two years. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonge </PERSON> escaped into the office from police custody after being arrested for aiding the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement.

 The author of the 15-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortion in the case of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> warned Tuesday that the 1988 term of the court could see the ruling overturned. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, who wrote the 1973 decision overturning restrictive anti-abortion laws in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, indicated the decision could turn on how faithful new Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is to the judicial doctrine of `` stare decisis,'' a policy of courts not to disturb a settled point of law. `` The next question is, ` <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> go down the drain?''' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, 79, told a class of first-year law students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` I think there's a very distinct possibility that it will _ this term. You can count the votes.'' In an apparent reference to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said: `` One never knows what a new justice's attitude toward stare decisis is. It's now 15 years old. No abortion case is scheduled for argument before the court, but there is speculation in the legal community that the court will look for one now that the panel includes three appointees of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, a noted opponent of abortions. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said his majority opinion in <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> `` has been criticized from all points of the compass,'' but he would n't change it much if he were to write it today. He decided the case primarily on the basis of a woman's constitutional right to decide what to do with her body. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> went into no further detail on the possibility of the decision being overturned. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said the abortion issue, which he has addressed in many decisions for the court since 1973, is a `` very controversial, emotional, distressful kind of litigation that has been politicized in the last few years.'' He noted the picketing by anti-abortionists around the country during the presidential campaign, saying: `` I respect their opinions. I just wish they would n't make a single issue out of a political campaign but this too will pass away, as Mr. <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON> said a long time ago.'' Commenting on <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>'s remarks, <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` It is highly improper for a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justice to interject himself into a presidential campaign, as Justice <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> did.'' `` Apparently Justice <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> himself is on the campaign trail, trying to energize certain opinion elites to rally in defense of <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, `` <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Apparently <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> recognizes that <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> can not survive merely on its constitutional merits, so he is calling for cavalry support.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group claims 3,000 chapters nationwide. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said his abortion opinion has generated more mail than any other court opinion. `` I would say that probably, I get a dozen letters a day, some very abusive and others, on the other side of the case, are the most lovely letters I get,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` Just as an example, I got this cheery little mailgram recently from <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>: ` Because you satanic <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices stand against God, against justice, against victims, against common sense, against honesty and everything clean, you will also stand before almighty God while your blood-soaked hands drip with the blood of innocent victims. You <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices stink with moral rot.''' `` Here's one that I rather like,'' he said. `` It came out of <LOCATION> Iola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. It has little stamps up here, ` Go Union.' ` May I please have your autograph. Paragraph. You are responsible for the deaths of more babies than anyone else in the history of the world and this is just the beginning of the slaughter of the helpless. Paragraph. I would certainly appreciate your autograph.' If ever there was a schizophrenic letter.'' `` Well, they come in,'' he said of the letters. `` There are some threatening materials, of course, and a good bit of it is organized. And a lot of it is tunnel vision.''

 Officials from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> readied relief efforts Tuesday as they anxiously awaited details on the damage wrought by <PERSON> Hurricane </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s passage through their home islands. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 plane with international and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials aboard went to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> to set up a satellite communication system to coordinate help in the giant hurricane's aftermath `` This hurricane from what I can gather is about the worst in its -LRB- <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s -RRB- history,'' said <PERSON> Percival </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>'s deputy consul-general in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It just souped up over the entirety of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>. There's no place on the island that escaped.'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> missed most of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, bringing strong winds, rain squalls and tides 1 to 2 feet above normal to the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. But officials of <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, a British colony, were preparing to hear the worst. `` We experienced Hurricane Charlie, so we're accustomed to savage attacks by tropical storms,'' <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> was the last major hurricane to strike the island directly, claiming 111 lives in 1951, he said. Serious flooding had already swamped the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> by Tuesday afternoon, and officials there expected heavy damage, said <PERSON> Erina </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cayman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourism </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said a relief center for the <ORGANIZATION> Caymans </ORGANIZATION> was accepting donations in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and three centers in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were collecting food, clothing and medical supplies for Jamaicans left homeless or injured by the hurricane. Three Air <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> planes full of supplies were ready to fly from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> once an airport there was confirmed to be safe, said <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ambulance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. `` With 150 mph winds lasting 10 hours over <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, it has to be serious,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> questioned on Tuesday whether <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is up to dealing with Soviet leaders at a time when Soviet economic difficulties offer great opportunities for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been around <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a long time, but if he could n't stand up to the ayatollah or say ` no' to -LRB- Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, how will he measure up to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` And if he truly believes that <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is qualified to be one heartbeat away from the presidency, how can we trust his judgment when <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future is on the line,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Foreign Relations in what campaign aides described as a major address outlining his view of U.S.-Soviet relations. It was part of a week devoted largely to national security issues by the Democratic presidential nominee, who is trying to counter the Republicans' depiction of him as soft on defense. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> intensified that effort later at a General Dynamics tank facility in <LOCATION> Sterling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, where he donned a helmet and rode in a M-1 <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> tank, the military's top battlefield tank, and pledged to make strengthening conventional weapons among his top defense priorities. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stood through the hatch of the tank, his hand resting on a 7.62 mm machine gun, the tank's turret and cannon spinning, as the tank was driven at high speed around a grassy field. He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had tried to cut tank production by one-quarter and asserted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would cut conventional military spending to finance the Star Wars nuclear defense program. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> planned to address defense and weapons in a speech Wednesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Aides scheduled a stop in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> park, to view fire damage, on his way to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Thursday. In his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> speech, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the next president must `` seize the intiative'' in dealing with the Soviets. However, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has no strategy for testing the limits of what is called ` new thinking' in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has an economy facing difficulty in providing for its people and that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants access to Western technology, resources and trade. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants to make his country part of the international economic community,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` What is he prepared to do in return? Will we allow him to pursue that strategy unchallenged, or will we have a strategy of our own to rotect <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> interests and translate Soviet economic weakness into improved Soviet behavior in world affairs?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would deal firmly with the Soviets and said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is a Leninist who `` has not abandoned Soviet goals.'' He said, `` It would be naive to take <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at his word, but it would be dangerous to allow his words to go unanswered.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he would challenge the Soviets to reduce European troops, cool regional conflicts, end the spread of nuclear and chemical weapons and missiles, reject terrorism and allow the emigration of Jews and other minorities. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> must understand that if there is to be a fundamental change in the relationship of his country with the Western world, there must first be a fundamental change in the balance of forces in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He said he wanted to build on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces reduction agreement and would challenge <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to eliminate a Soviet advantage in tanks and artillery in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` not just by demobilizing those weapons but by destroying them.'' He also said he would seek to have the Soviets withdraw troops `` back into the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hammered at his theme that Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, was not up to dealing forcefully with the Soviets. He noted that three vice presidents since 1945 have been propelled suddenly to the presidency and that all of them later met as president with Soviet leaders. `` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is no <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` He's no <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. And he sure ai n't <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. Can we stake our future on the hope that he is a match for <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wrapped up the day in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where in a speech to the Congressional Hispanic Caucus he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s appointment of a Hispanic, <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, to Secretary of Education, was too little too late. `` For some people it's enough to wake up after eight years and create opportunity for one Hispanic,'' he said. `` I want to stand with you and create opportunity for 20 million Hispanics.''

<HEAD>Woerner Warns Against Dropping Guard, Sees Larger European Role In
NATO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said on Tuesday that Western Europeans will have to spend more for defense to avert a trans-Atlantic `` slanging match'' between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, in his first public speech since taking over as top political official of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said he welcomed Soviet reforms, but doubted they would `` go far enough.'' `` We must take account of realities more than intentions,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization. `` Soviet defense programs have not slowed down.'' But he added, `` I see more opportunities than risks ahead.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies should challenge Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to make more progress toward military stability in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, a global ban on chemical weapons, greater observation of human rights and deeper economic and scientific cooperation. `` The success of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is the driving force behind the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership's reforms, political as well as economic, but it is doubtful that they go far enough to overcome the structural failings of the Soviet system,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. `` All this underscores just how wrong, indeed dangerous, it would be for the alliance to take a leap of faith and to let down its guard,'' said <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> who had been the West German defense minister before taking the alliance post last July 1. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the issue of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> assuming a larger share of the common defense burden had been a central theme in his first discussions with European leaders, and `` they are committed to an equitable sharing of responsibility for collective defense,'' he said. `` The burden-sharing debate must not be allowed to degenerate into a numbers game or a trans-Atlantic slanging match,'' he said. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said he would work for `` a stronger European pillar within the alliance'' but added that it was essential for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> to remain committed to the defense of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said the allies should expand their cooperation outside the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> area, an idea that has encountered resistance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` The Europeans and Canadians do not have the same kind of superpower responsibilities as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but they do have a global role,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said, citing examples such as providing aid to the Third World, thwarting Libyan aggression in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> and patrolling the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> met for nearly three hours on Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and discussed the `` full range of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> issues,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. He is to meet with other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials this week, including President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Friday.

 Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> talked with the captain of <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1141 for the first time Tuesday afternoon, but gleaned no information that could pinpoint the cause of the Aug. 31 crash, a board member said. `` He does not know why this plane crashed,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who summarized the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION>'s interview with <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who spent nearly two hours talking with investigators, had been at Parkland Memorial Hospital since his <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 crashed as it took off from <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, killing 14. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, one of 94 survivors, was discharged from the hospital following the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> interview. Wearing a back brace and with his mouth wired shut, he left the hospital with his wife and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> officials, a hospital spokeswoman said. <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> had n't expected the interview with captain to yield a clue that might solve the puzzling crash, although investigators had been awaiting permission to talk to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' physician had barred investigators from interviewing <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> earlier. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told investigators that the flight from <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> had been uneventful, and that everything seemed normal again as he waited on the taxiway to leave for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He recalled shutting down the right engine to save fuel as the plane waited on the runway, then restarting it, <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. But as the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 climbed into the air, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> heard `` two loud bangs, or explosions.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> did not recall any warning beforehand to indicate something was amiss. `` He previously experienced compressor stalls, but nothing like this,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told investigators he went to full power and simply `` tried to keep the airplane in the air.'' But he does n't recall looking down at his instrument panel to see if there were any warning signals activated. Investigators had hoped <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> might be able to tell them if the plane's wing flaps had been set correctly. But he could only tell them that he remembered they were approved in a preflight checklist. One of the inconsistencies the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> had been trying to clear up has been the fact the cockpit recording indicated the flaps were in a normal takeoff position for a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727. But wreckage from the plane showed the flaps to be in a retracted, or improper, position. `` He said he does not remember anything in relation to the flap handle,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said.

 A severe thunderstorm may have triggered a rock slide that sheared off the front of a Greyhound bus, killing five people and injuring 14, police said Tuesday. The accident occurred late Monday as the driver and 20 passengers drove through a mountainous strip of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> Highway 68 above the rain-swollen <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. The bus was en route to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>. A boulder the size of a car's front end tumbled from the mountain as the bus approached, striking it broadside and apparently killing the driver instantly, police said. `` It sheared the front end of the bus off,'' said state police Officer <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuni </PERSON>. Witnesses said that after the boulder hit, the bus crashed into several large rocks but remained upright. The rocks probably prevented the bus from careening off a steep embankment and plummeting into the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION>, said the Rev. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> McComb </PERSON>, a Dixon Fire Department volunteer. `` All we heard were screams,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, a Mormon missionary from <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> traveling with another missionary, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` People were thrown out of the bus when we hit these rocks here.'' The driver was identified as <PERSON> Gaylon </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON>, a spokesman for Greyhound in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Parks </PERSON> had worked for the bus company exactly seven years on Monday. The dead were identified as <PERSON> Peedjk </PERSON> <PERSON> Akkandi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sridnaran </PERSON>, 59, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, 41, who was believed to be en route with her family to a new home in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; a 64-year-old man from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, whose name was not being immediately released; and a woman about 18 years old who carried no identification and is believed to be a Mexican national. Authorities still were trying to identify the toddler belonging to the unidentified woman who was killed. The child, estimated to be 18 months to 2 years old, was in the <LOCATION> Espanola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in stable condition, and will be placed in the state's custody if relatives ca n't be found, officials said. Four of the 14 injured were hospitalized in either stable or satisfactory condition. Ten people were treated and released. Rocks ranging from baseball - to file cabinet-size littered the road near the bus The owner of an Espanola radio station said the area had been hit by a powerful storm just hours before the accident. State Police Officer T.R. <PERSON> Rodella </PERSON> said the rain might have set off the slide. `` It's been raining off and on here all day,'' he said. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the driver was going only 45 or 55 mph when the crash occurred. `` I felt an impact,'' said <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. `` All of a sudden I felt debris coming at us. A bright light flashed, like sparks and electricity in the front end of the bus, being destroyed.'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, the only passengers not injured, escaped through windows and helped others out. Passenger <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> of <PERSON> Houston </PERSON> said he was sitting about six seats behind the driver when he heard three crashing sounds he believed were caused by rocks. He said he hit the floor and that people were flying around the bus. He looked next to him and saw a crying baby trapped beneath some seats, he said. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said he went to the mother and saw blood on her face. He was unable to feel a pulse and assumed she was dead, <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said. He said he and another man freed the child. `` Children were crying, people were crying, people were lying down,'' <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Opposition Denounces Banning of TV Spot on Torture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition leaders on Tuesday denounced the banning of an anti-government campaign commercial describing alleged torture by President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s secret police. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, meanwhile, ordered the cancellation of a pro-government television advertisement scheduled for Tuesday to make up for the banning of the opposition's Monday night spot. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the 72-year-old army commander who seized power in a 1973 military coup, faces a national referendum Oct. 5 on a proposed eight more years of rule. According to government-approved rules for the campaign, his backers and opponents each receive 15 minutes of free television time nightly. On Monday night, only the pro-Pinochet spot was aired. The national television censorship board had objected to a one-minute, 55-second segment of the opposition's advertisement that quoted a federal judge investigating alleged cases of torture by the secret police. Opposition leaders said Wednesday the board offered to let them substitute a different segment, but they refused. The board then decided to bar airing of the entire 15-minute spot. `` We do n't accept censorship,'' Socialist <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagos </PERSON>, co-leader of a 16-party opposition coalition, told a news conference Tuesday. `` What happened last night helps to remind us that we are facing a dictator, and not in a fair electoral battle.'' <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat also leading the coalition, said: `` It's a dictator's action.'' The absence of the opposition ad sparked pot-banging and other demonstrations of anti-government sentiment around <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, especially in working-class neighborhoods. `` <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> made a big mistake,'' <PERSON> Zaldivar </PERSON> said. `` In trying to do us damage, he created a reaction in the people that is overwhelmingly in our favor.'' <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON>, executive secretary of the censorship board, called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said it objected to the segment because `` it attempted to involve the judicial power in a political campaign.'' He said at a news conference that the council had consulted the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which said it had not authorized the judge's remarks.

The segment was extracted from a television interview <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> gave months ago, apparently to a foreign network. In March, he was told by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to stop speaking publicly about the cases. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> said the segment had been broadcast in at least 15 other countries. `` I ask why they refuse to let Chileans see what a Chilean judge has said, and which can be seen in the rest of the world?'' he said. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Poblete </PERSON>, the Cabinet-rank government general secretary, told reporters that on Tuesday night only the opposition's 15-minute time slot would be broadcast The pro-government spot was being canceled at <ORGANIZATION> Pinochet </ORGANIZATION>'s order to keep the campaign fair, he said. If a majority vote yes in the plebiscite, <ORGANIZATION> Pinochet </ORGANIZATION> will remain president until 1997. If most voters reject him, open elections will be held in a year and he will hand over power to the winner in 1990. The government ordered free television time, from 10:45 p.m. to 11:15 p.m. each weeknight and at mid-day on weekends, starting Sept. 5 and ending Oct. 1.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Thugs burned down an empty Roman Catholic chapel Tuesday several hours after six people claimed responsibility for a massacre inside another church and threatened more such attacks. The government said it would investigate the attacks, but the opposition said the military regime instigated them. Later Tuesday, unidentified men attacked Radio Cacique _ which often airs opposition opinions _ slightly injured three employees and made off with broadcasting equipment, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> said police did not respond to a telephone call for help from Radio Cacique. Opposition figures charged that the military regime of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> was behind the pre-dawn blaze Tuesday that leveled the Chapel of Immaculate Conception in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>'s Cite Soleil slum area. Reporters who arrived on the scene said they were chased away by hoodlums. The reporters said the hoodlums included one of the six people who appeared on television Monday night to boast about his participation in the Sunday massacre at the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. At least six people died and 77 were wounded when thugs armed with machetes and guns burst into St. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> during a Mass and attacked parishioners while police and soldiers stood by outside, witnesses said. The pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> church </ORGANIZATION>, which was burned after the slaughter, is Rev. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, a critic of <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s military government and a popular figure among <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s povertry-stricken `` The government has committed a genocide on an unarmed people. It is for the international community to put a stop to it,'' <PERSON> Sylvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Claude </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one of <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s most popular opposition leaders, said on <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday `` After all the evidence I have heard on the St. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bosco </PERSON> affair it is clear that the government organized it,'' <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> said. The five men and a woman who appeared on government television Monday night claimed they were supporters of a rival priest, the Rev. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Volel </PERSON> of the Chapel of Immaculate Conception. Opposition leaders said the story was concocted by the government to cover the real reason for the attack. `` The story of bloody rivalry between priests is baseless. It is a blatant attempt by the government to mislead the public,'' <PERSON> Jean-Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Honorat </PERSON>, head of the Haitian Center for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. The six who appeared on television made no attempt to hide their identity and spoke on the government-controlled network without apparent fear of arrest or reprisals. They also spoke on radio. They claimed the violence was related to an internal conflict within the church and threatened `` a heap of corpses'' at any Mass celebrated by <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>. <PERSON> Volel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> order, are well-known in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> for their work with the urban poor. <PERSON> Volel </PERSON> denied on private Tele-Haiti Tuesday that there was a rivalry. Rev. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesidor </PERSON>, superior of the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION>, said on Radio Soleil: `` We denounce all worn-out trickery and maneuvers which would lead people to believe that everything which happened is a result of internal conflict between priests.'' Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafontant </PERSON>, auxiliary bishop of <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>, denounced the attacks. `` In the name of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> we say stop this destruction,'' <PERSON> Lafontant </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soleil </ORGANIZATION>, a church-run station. The government issued a communique late Tuesday promising to investigate the church attacks and saying it `` sympathizes with the families of the victims, the <ORGANIZATION> Salesian </ORGANIZATION> fathers and the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` The military government regrets the incidents which occurred on the 11th and 12th of September ... in which the churches of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> and Immaculate Conception were burned,'' read the communique broadcast by radio stations. `` The police -LRB- are -RRB- pursuing the culprits, among whom are the self-proclaimed perpetrators who appeared on television,'' it said. The government issued similar statements following previous mass killings and political assassinations, but did not follow through with investigations. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> returned to power in a June 19 coup that ousted the 4-month-old civilian government of President <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Manigat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> ruled for two years before that as head of a junta after former President <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1986. <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON>, during his sermons, has denounced army atrocities. <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Franck </PERSON> <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that <PERSON> Aristide </PERSON> was `` justly punished'' by the massacre. The priest was shielded by parishoners during the attack Sunday and escaped. `` Those who massacred the worshippers at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have been identified as the henchmen of the mayor,'' <PERSON> Honorat </PERSON> said. Several witnesses said they recognized city hall employees among the assailants. <PERSON> Romain </PERSON> denied it. When reporters from <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> visited the charred remains of the Immaculate Conception Chapel Tuesday, unidentified men at the scene threatened the reporter from Haiti-Inter, which refused to broadcast the statement by the six self-confessed killers Monday. The Radio Metropole reporter recognized one of the men as a member of the group of six who boasted about Sunday's massacre. They made their statement on private <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropole </ORGANIZATION> and Tele-Haiti and government-run <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION>.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-16 jets crashed in separate accidents Tuesday, injuring eight people on the ground in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, while the pilot of the second craft ejected to safety near a base in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said a jet crashed into a stand of trees in <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and exploded, injuring eight people on the ground. The pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, ejected from the plane and was treated at the base hospital. The plane crashed about 3:50 p.m., about one mile south of the military facility after taking off on a training mission. `` The explosion felt like my house was breaking in two,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Holley </PERSON>, who ran outside her trailer home when she heard the crash about 75 yards away. `` It was a fireball and the house behind it was on fire and people were yelling and screaming and it was horrible.'' Officials at first thought the plane hit a house, but later decided the house caught fire after the plane crashed. `` The house did n't appear to be hit,'' <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Causey </PERSON> said. `` It appeared the plane hit, skipped and went by the house. Evidently it caught it on fire.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 59, suffered second - and third-degree burns over 50 percent of his body and was taken to <LOCATION> Tuomey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> where he was in critical condition, according to <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>, director of business development at the hospital <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was being transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, Tuesday night. Five of the people injured were treated and released, <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON> said. One person was admitted to the base hospital in stable condition, another was in good condition at <LOCATION> Tuomey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. It was not immediately known whether those injured were inside the house the plane struck. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, pilot Capt. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, ejected safely when the jet went down 25 miles west of the <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> near the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Mons-Liddle </PERSON>. The fighter was returning to the base from a routine training mission. Both accidents were being investigated. The <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> crash was the third involving an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet from the base in the past several weeks. Sumter is 40 miles east of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. And in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, 27 F-16 crashes with seven fatalities have occured at the base since the aircraft began to be flown there in January 1979, officials said.

The steps are the outgrowth of nearly four years experience with radon, an odorless, colorless gas the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has now linked to 20,000 lung cancer deaths a year nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Monday every home in the country should be tested for radon because contamination is wider spread than previously believed. Radon is a radioactive gas, trace amounts of which are produced in the decay of uranium in soil and rocks. The gas is present in the outdoors normally at about 0.5 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s 4 picocurie `` action level.'' Homes tend to concentrate radon indoors.

 <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mull </PERSON> is delighted. He has found a parking place right in front of the <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> restaurant. But, of course _ his car is white. Blond-haired, blue-eyed Mull has become a white person by profession since 1985, due to the success of an innocuous notion he and fellow white writer <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON> had one day _ `` The History of White People in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Based on my experiences in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and his in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, we figured we had the Grain Belt pretty well in hand,'' Mull said over lunch, a salad with a lot of white stuff in it. `` We started describing what makes a person white by our standards. And in this case, the standards were liberal enough they could include black people; there are certain Caucasians who do not qualify, as well.'' A friend at a movie studio told the two they should send the idea to the cable television people, Mull recalled. `` We said send what? We do n't have anything other than the title. He said, that does n't matter.'' Mull and <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON> produced a two-part <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON> special, `` Martin Mull Presents the History of White People in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' instructing viewers on the identification of the white person: habitat, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>; its clothing, polyester; its food, tuna noodle casseroles and Cheezits. We were informed the specials were sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Zanesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and funded through a grant from Tastee-Freeze. The specials were among the most successful <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON> had aired, and they spawned two best-selling books. In 1986, Mull and <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON> followed up with a four-part series on white religion, crime, stress and politics. The series has since been packaged for home video. Mull, the on-camera host of the series, took viewers right into the lair of the white people, <LOCATION> Hawkins </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and introduced them to quintessential white couple <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Place </PERSON> -RRB- and their offspring, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>, students at <ORGANIZATION> Dinah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Now <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON> presents White People: The Movie. `` <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mull </PERSON> in Portrait of a White Marriage'' premiered on the cable channel last week and is being played Thursday and on Sept. 17, 20, 23 and 28. The two-hour movie takes characters from the instructional series and sets them up for a psycho-cultural crisis _ even as the day of the Hawkins Falls Founder's Day parade approaches. `` White People'' was often viciously satiric. In `` White Marriage,'' Mull and <PERSON> Rucker </PERSON> have softened up. The laughs are more mainstream, and the movie is a virtual homage to old-fashioned values in the face of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> starshine. For his part, Mull is now proud father of a 3-year-old daughter. His wife, <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON>, a composer, wrote the score for `` White Marriage'' and has a bit part _ as an ex-con trying to start a diaper service. In the movie, Mull plays the slick host of `` Ask <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>,'' a `` Donahue'' - like talk show When he ca n't fill a studio in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, he goes to <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Falls </PERSON> in a pathetic effort to keep the show afloat, intending to lure starstruck housewives into a gymnasium to talk about such subjects as `` women who have lost parts of their bodies through household accidents.'' He enlists <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> as his unpaid assistant and falls in love with her. It seems the big Hollywood star actually longs for the comforts of a Midwestern home. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> becomes jealous and embarks on an affair with the minister's wife -LRB- <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> -RRB-. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> plays the minister. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON>, who directed the movie, plays Mull's producer. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> makes a cameo appearance as <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Loman </PERSON>, a salesman who is rooming at the same motel as Mull. Since completing the movie, Mull has moved on from `` White People'' to black comedy. He's written a feature film, scheduled to go before the cameras this fall, about two homeless men in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> and and Mr. <PERSON> Nickles </PERSON>, called `` Wood' n' Nickles.'' A new movie for <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON>, `` Change of Heart,'' will mark his directing debut. `` I think the word ` terror' is overused, but apt,'' he said. `` Change of Heart'' is a `` somber comedy,'' <PERSON> Mull </PERSON> said, about a heart transplant that raises the philosophical questions implied by the figurative meanings of the word `` heart.''

<TEXT>
 A sign of the times arrived on the market during the past couple of weeks, a newsletter dedicated to the thesis that the way to make money in stocks is to buy undervalued blue chips and hold them. The publishers of `` Blue Chip Values'' say they will stress fundamental research to find basic values, demonstrable through such mathematical evidence as price-earnings ratios, yields, price-to-book value and return on equity. `` Now more than ever, good fundamental research is needed to bring true values to the surface _ not hocus pocus and market timing trends,'' they say. What a contrast to a year ago! Back then, the stock market was a crazy carnival, a whirl of noise, a blur of activity, with excitement kept at a level of shrill intensity by thrilling performances, fantastic forecasts, and big winners every other minute. What expectation! What entertainment! The spielers and barkers outdid each other. Each attraction seemed bigger and better than the other. Three thousand on the Dow? That's nothing, one of them said. `` We forecast 3,600 points.'' Then the tent collapsed on the carnival and all the esoteric theories. The Dow Jones industrial average shriveled to half that forecast, and the shouting was seen for what it was, a hysteria of avarice and self-delusion. And that produced the market setting for <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to add their latest basic-value newsletter to a stable that already includes `` Investment Horizons,'' `` FundProbe'' and `` The Mutual Fund Letter.'' Their proposal is incredibly simple: Buy sound common stocks whose value can be demonstrated. Choose value, and then wait for the market to come to you. This approach to stocks exchews the day-to-day view. `` If you need to know daily about your investments then they're not investments,'' says <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, who founded <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to offer investment counsel and materials after years as a mathematics professor Co-editor <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> observes that small investors must take the long-term view rather than attempt to trade. Those who try, she says, `` are drawn in only when the market is exciting; they're always in and out at the wrong time. In truth, says <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>, `` if people knew how easy investing is they wouuld n't need people like me.'' His theories rely on the efficiency of the market; that is, that stocks selling above or below value eventually adjust. But, he continues, the hypothesis of most market advice is that the market is n't efficient. When that assumption is made, he says, it becomes a different game altogether, one in which frequent and often exotic advice is rationalized. Says Pierce: `` Too few people who buy stock even realize that they are buying a business. They do n't think in such terms; they're gambling, playing the funny money games. You are n't likely to find hot stocks on the <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> lists. There is no stock of the week, no telephone hot line. Why would you need such things when your recommendations are these: _ <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Progress -LRB- electric utility -RRB-, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> WPL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- electric utility -RRB- for above-average yield _ Deluxe, a checkprinter, as a special situation _ Banc One, in banking, <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> in leisure products, <LOCATION> James </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in paper products and <ORGANIZATION> Pfizer </ORGANIZATION> in health care, chosen in part for their low price-earnings ratios _ <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION>, chosen in part because of its low price to book value There probably are n't any quick bucks in such stocks, for subscribers or for <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> and <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perritt </PERSON> jests that when matched against the offerings of the hucksters and touts, their theory of buy and hold seems almost unsaleable. But maybe the market is ready, even at $ 175 for 17 issues a year. As with all investments, be patient. To promote `` Blue Chips Values,'' the authors offer the first three issues free _ no obligation to subscribe _ from <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, 205 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wacker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Drive </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> 60606.

 The `` miracle babies'' who survived in the rubble of collapsed hospitals after the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> earthquake in 1985 now are 3-year-olds, thriving on special attention from doctors and relatives. <PERSON> Evelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasca </PERSON>, good-humored and playful, likes to sing and dance. Her favorite is `` Speedy <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>,'' or was, before she broke the record and pulled the cartridge out of the turntable arm. <PERSON> Sarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>, another of the 19 miracle toddlers, lives with her grandparents in a community with a view of snow-capped volcanos. She entertains herself with the chickens, ducks and cows in the small yard or helps her grandparents tend their crops. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> or `` Chuchito,'' possibly the biggest miracle of all, finally is walking and beginning to talk. All the babies except Chuchito were from a few hours to a few days old when the quake struck at 7:19 a.m. Sept. 19, 1985, bringing the two hospitals where they were born crashing down. Government figures put the death toll at about 6,000 people; unofficial sources put the toll as high as 32,000. Including the hospitals, more than 400 buildings in the city of 18 million were destroyed and 5,700 damaged, the government said. <PERSON> Chuchito </PERSON> was 21 days old when the quake hit, in an incubator and on intravenous liquids because of problems at birth. When the 12-story hospital fell, everyone except his mother gave him up for dead. The 19 babies survived amid the rubble from eight hours to nearly nine days after the quake. Cold and almost unconscious, <PERSON> Chuchito </PERSON> was found after a week. `` Chuchito was just meant to live. No matter what happened he was going to live,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawatzky </PERSON>, a Canadian who was in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when the quake hit and has been helping victims ever since. `` These babies were under very severe conditions, without food for a long period, with hypothermia, hypoglycemia,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, who cares for 14 of them. They had infected wounds and were dehydrated, but only one suffered lasting injuries, doctors say, a boy who suffered a deformed hip joint because of infection. The boy, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON>, learned to walk four months ago. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> and other doctors say the other babies are normal except for one who was born without legs from the knees down and <PERSON> Chuchito </PERSON>, whose slowness in walking and talking they say are due to his birth problems. <PERSON> Evelia </PERSON> will have to have surgery on her tear ducts and needs orthopedic shoes, her aunt said. About half the children, including <LOCATION> Evelia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sarita </PERSON>, lost their mothers, but all are in what social workers consider to be good family situations. In one sense the babies are lucky. They were from poor families and have had more medical attention and stimulation than they would have had otherwise. And they caught the hearts of everyone. `` The ones I worry about are the secondary victims'' who are n't in the limelight, said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogozinski </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> Private and Voluntary Organizations here. The agency channels private donations from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to earthquake victims. Among them are the six older sisters of <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON>, another of the babies. While <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON> is cared for by a doting aunt, her sisters, now 5 to 12 years old, were seriously neglected even though they were living in the same household. With a donation from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they are now living and going to school in a convent during the week. Donations also are supposed to help build a home for <PERSON> Lucia </PERSON>'s father and sisters on a lot left by his wife, although neighbors now are claiming the land. Also less fortunate are a boy and his four sisters, 3 to 12, who lost their parents in the quake and are now in an orphanage. An American couple was approved as adoptive parents, but sources familiar with the case say an uncle of the child has blocked the process. He wants legal custody but does not want the children to live with him and denies accusations that he is interested only in a trust fund that benefits the children, the sources said. Poverty is a besetting problem for the earthquake babies' families <PERSON> Sarita </PERSON>'s father, who visits often, lives and sells tamales in an area of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> with no street lighting or other public services and dirt streets that are barely passable by car even when dry. <PERSON> Evelia </PERSON>'s aunt, uncle and father sell used clothing, costume jewelry and other items in a market to support themselves and their five children. <PERSON> Evelia </PERSON>'s uncle, <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Becerra </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguillon </PERSON>, said sales were down and he ca n't raise his own prices to make up for the higher prices they have to pay for food and other items. `` We manage to make enough to cover the expenses,'' he said. `` Not very well, but more or less.''

<HEAD>In Chilean Farm Country, Political Question Is Tinged by Fear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FERNANDO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the country's agricultural heartland, old ingrained fears tinge the debate over the referendum next month on Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s presidency. For prosperous landowners, frightening memories of farm seizures by leftist peasants in the early 1970s has helped push them solidly into the pro-Pinochet camp. `` This is the fear we have, of returning to the past,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Olea </PERSON>, owner of a 100-acre spread here in the country's fertile <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> But for struggling farm workers, the prospect of reprisal by their bosses or local officials is keeping many from openly voicing dissent. Some say resentment with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s authoritarian rule, and with a hand-to-mouth existence, will find expression in the ballot box. `` At least before there was work, and the worker had the right to express his opinion,'' said laborer <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, as he painted a tractor by the roadside. Two farmhands with him made similar comments, but refused to give their names. Chileans will decide Oct. 5 in a yes or no ballot on a new term for <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the right-wing army commander who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup and has already ruled longer than any previous president. If a majority vote for him, he will remain as president until 1997, but the military junta that he has headed as the governing body since 1973 will be disbanded. If he loses, open elections will be held in a year and he must hand over power in 1990, when a new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, two-thirds elected and one-third appointed, will go into place. <PERSON> Farmowner </PERSON> <PERSON> Olea </PERSON> and others like him have benefited from an export-oriented, free-market economic program carried out by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s administration. Foreign sales of grapes and other fruit, much of it grown in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, have been booming. With government credits and technological assistance, many farm owners are expanding production and making solid profits. But they have not forgotten the chaotic, radical reform programs launched by President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a self-declared Marxist elected in 1970 and toppled in the coup led by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> three years later. <PERSON> Olea </PERSON>'s home and land were illegally seized by peasants. He negotiated with them so he could live in his house, which also had been taken over, while they worked his land as they liked. `` We lived through a savage lack of order,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Aullet </PERSON>, who is partner with his brother <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> in a 70-acre farm. `` There was no respect for your home, your land.'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aullet </PERSON> said the Allende government sent `` experts'' with no knowledge of agriculture to supervise land reform programs. `` What we fear is -LRB- that kind of -RRB- ignorance,'' he said. The landowners said that, with the production boom, conditions for farm workers were improving significantly. `` Manpower is becoming scarce, and there's competition in salaries to attract workers,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aullet </PERSON> said. `` Anyone who wants work can find it.'' The Aullets said that at the height of the harvesting season, workers could not be found for less than 1,000 pesos, about twice the minimum legal daily wage and equivalent to about $ 4. Their positive vision of rural <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> is shared by <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s campaign strategists, who predict overwhelming voter support from the heartland Opposition leaders contend that the countryside's poor majority are suffering economically and are eager for a change but wo n't say so publicly because they fear losing their jobs or government benefits, such as pensions and housing subsidies. The opposition's political campaign is aimed at overcoming such fears, while recognizing them as legitimate. One prominent campaign slogan in the countryside is `` Say yes, but vote no.'' Several farm workers said harvesting jobs paid an average 700 pesos, or less than $ 3 a day, and lasted only a few months a year. `` You ca n't live on that,'' <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON>, who sells bread from the back of his small, battered truck in the countryside around <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION>, said most of his customers opposed <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s continued rule. `` I travel 50 kilometers -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- a day, and I can tell you there are a lot more people for the ` no' vote than the ` yes' vote,'' he said But he added: `` Lots of people may vote ` yes' because they're afraid. He said that in one remote town on his bread route, <LOCATION> Tinguiririca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, `` people are telling each other that if you vote ` no,' you'll be arrested.'' The government has said the vote will be secret, and the opposition has publicized its plans to have representatives at each polling place to prevent intimidation.

He is an `` arenero,'' a sand-digger, and ekes out a meager existence supplying sand for construction sites in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the capital 10 miles to the south. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> spends his time pulling an iron-wheeled wagon loaded with 800 pounds of bananas from the eastern bus terminal to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s central market. Neither has anything to show for his work except the sinewy muscle of his arms and back. What they earn with their toil is not so much a living as another day's survival. The hard life is harder for the poor in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Though there is no official parameter such as a `` poverty line,'' it is clear that the great majority of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s 5.5 million people are poor. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> says 27 percent of children under 5 are malnourished. Infant mortality is 91 per 1,000 live births, the highest rate in Central America. Half the population lacks safe drinking water, and the leading cause of death is intestinal infection, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. Only four out of 10 people can read and write. `` With this you make enough to eat, that's it,'' says the grizzled <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON>, 55, pausing to lean on his shovel. He and his wife reared seven children in a two-room adobe house. Three of the six boys became sand-diggers. Ayala rises every day, including Sunday, at 3 a.m. so as to be at the river by 4. The first trucks arrive at dawn, by which time <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON> has shoveled a ton of sand. On a good day he'll dig three or four one-ton truckloads and make 15 to 20 colones -LRB- $ 3 to $ 4 -RRB-. With that his wife will buy rice, beans, tortillas, perhaps a few eggs and some cheese _ enough for the couple and their one remaining dependent child. `` You ca n't save a colon,'' he says. `` The few cents you set aside go up in smoke with an illness, something like that.'' He says he feels strong and plans on working at least five more years. He'll depend on help from his sons when he can no longer work. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aristedes </PERSON> <PERSON> Najarro </PERSON>, who digs about 50 yards downriver from <LOCATION> Ayala </LOCATION>, is 48 years old and feels his strength draining. He does n't even want to think about how he'll get by when his back gives out `` I'll just have to find something else. Selling newspapers, or maybe I'll have to beg.'' At the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s central market, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> takes a break with three other `` carretoneros,'' or cart-pullers, seated on their sturdy wagons. A sweet, slightly nauseating odor wafts across the narrow street from a pile of rotten or mashed bananas. A middle-aged woman searches through the pile for still edible fruit. The cart-pullers, like the sand-diggers, make about $ 3 on an average day. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Granadeno </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, 29, sleep in a nearby flophouse that charges $ 2 a night for a piece of cardboard on the floor and water for bathing. That leaves them a dollar for food _ and for booze. `` Sometimes we go without eating to buy guaro,'' says <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, already in a semi-stupor from the cane liquor by 10 a.m. All four cart-pullers readily admitted they try to maintain a constant alcoholic haze. Several times a day they come up with the five colones to buy a half-liter of <LOCATION> Muneco </LOCATION>, the cheapest guaro. `` It's very hard, this life,'' said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>. `` There's no future in it. It damages your body. The only thing you're left with are the knocks.'' He motioned to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s bandaged hand, sprained from the strain of hauling. Asked his feelings about leftist guerrillas who say they are fighting for the poor, <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON> said: `` I understand nothing of politics. But some say they -LRB- the guerrillas -RRB- would make this another <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. I do n't want that.'' None of the sand-diggers or cart-pullers interviewed could read and none has ever voted. Democracy, which returned to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in 1982 after decades of military rule, means little to them. `` Democracy has done nothing,'' says <PERSON> Najarro </PERSON>. `` It has n't created jobs You look out for yourself and get by as best you can.'' `` I doubt the country can progress,'' says <PERSON> Ayala </PERSON>. `` I do n't have faith.''

 <PERSON> Melody </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> poisoned her first child. Her second is on the way. Now the judge who controls her fate has proposed an unorthodox solution to her troubled life _ sterilization. The proposal has thrust the expectant mother into a thorny legal debate over crime and punishment and whether the courts are playing God or protecting society. An outcry arose after Judge <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> suggested he might be more lenient if Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> were sterilized before he sentences her for feeding her 4-year-old son, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>, fatal doses of psychiatric drugs prescribed for her. `` She is a person who no longer needs to ever have any children,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. If she becomes a mother again, he warned, `` the possibility is there for the same thing to happen.'' Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, due to give birth late this month, has signed a consent form agreeing to sterilization, her attorney says. But her prospect of trading motherhood for a reduced prison term has outraged civil libertarians, feminists and the county prosecutor who say <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' proposal would deny her a most fundamental right. `` I do n't think it's appropriate for the court deciding who should have a child and who should n't,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Waples </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` You're authorizing a decision on reproductive capabilities that is dangerously close to eugenics -LRB- a form of selective breeding -RRB-. That's something that is foreign to our system and beliefs about the sanctity of human life and the limited power of the state.'' `` It reminds me of the Islamic punishment of cutting off a hand for theft,'' said lawyer <PERSON> Pequita </PERSON> <PERSON> Buis </PERSON>, state legislative coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't engage in physical mutilation for punishment in this country. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> insists his proposal is n't punitive or inconsistent with NOW tenets. `` They are the biggest advocates I am aware of how a woman should have the right to control her own body,'' he said. `` All I suggested to Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> is that she in fact think about that _ do something to control her own body.'' Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, who has told her attorney she will surrender her baby for adoption, pleaded guilty in June to neglect of a dependent _ giving her son drugs _ after the state agreed to drop murder charges. Shortly afterwards, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, then six months' pregnant, was hospitalized for weight loss. She's since been moved to a psychiatric ward, awaiting the prospect of six to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> says if Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> rejects sterilization, it wo n't hurt her in court; if she agrees, he says, it could ease mental pressure and be a mitigating factor. Her attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahoe </PERSON>, says he does n't think his client should become a mother again because she `` does n't seem to be mentally, financially or legally in a position to raise a child in a responsible way.'' But <PERSON> Donahoe </PERSON> says he fears that if she is sterilized, `` her already low self-esteem would be reduced almost to nothing.'' The ethical and legal questions raised in this case have surfaced elsewhere where court rulings have touched on the most intimate aspects of life. This month, an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> judge reversed her order requiring an 18-year-old mother to practice birth control throughout her childbearing years after she left two infant sons alone in a sweltering apartment for three days. The judge said the order was unenforceable because of the fallibility of birth control; the woman is pregnant again. In 1985, three convicted rapists in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> were resentenced after the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said a judge's decision to let them choose castration over prison violated safeguards against cruel and unusual punishment. And in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1986, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld a 5-to-15-year prison term imposed on <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> heir <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauntlett </PERSON> in place of the `` chemical castration'' originally levied after he pleaded no contest to raping a 14-year-old stepdaughter.

<HEAD>INDIANAPOLIS: 14-year-old stepdaughter.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The chemical castration, part of a sentence that included a year in prison and four years' probation, involved taking Depo-Provera, an experimental <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> drug used to reduce male sex drive. Such debates are n't new. In 1942, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> law allowing sterilization of certain groups of felons, noting that `` marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race. ... In evil or reckless hands it can cause races or types which are inimical to the dominant group to wither and disappear.'' And similar language is being used today. `` I do n't understand where any court in this country is qualified to tell people ... who's fit to breed and who is n't,'' said <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> public defender representing the woman originally sentenced to birth control. `` It does n't take a huge jump from Who can have children? to Whose life is meaningful and whose is n't?'' he said. `` These are questions the law is n't capable of answering.'' But others argue alternative sentences can be effective. `` We have a very, very destructive system,'' said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Polsby </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor. `` We send too many people down the river. We've got to be more creative. -LRB- If there are -RRB- people that you can handle in some other way, handle them in some other way.'' And although <PERSON> Polsby </PERSON> agreed with the need to protect rights, he said, `` 20 years of close confinement in a penitentiary is as serious a deprivation of civil liberties as you can imagine, short of being killed.'' That's a good possibility for Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, a 29-year-old unemployed waitress with a history of emotional problems and self-abuse. Last summer, while awaiting trial, Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> injected urine in her breasts, a bizarre act <PERSON> Donahoe </PERSON> said stemmed from frustration and depression. Many years ago, he said, she nicked her wrists with a razor. Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>'s behavior was scrutinized shortly after <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>'s birth when medical workers noticed the baby's repeated coughing, vomiting and breathing difficulties occurred only when his mother was alone with him <PERSON> Donahoe </PERSON> said the boy was placed in a foster home but was returned to his mother several weeks later when suspicions of abuse could not be proven. On Aug. 28, 1986, <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> was hospitalized with a cough. Five days later, after improving steadily, he suddenly grew lethargic; he was in a coma by the next morning. On Sept. 5, life support was turned off. An autopsy found he had died from drugs likely given within 24 hours of cardiac arrest, which caused his brain death. The drugs, specifically an anti-depressant and an anti-psychotic, were dispensed to his mother. Originally, prosecutors claimed Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> turned off an alarm on a monitor that would have alerted nurses to <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON>'s sudden change in brain activity. She denied the allegation, and it was dropped from the final charges before the plea agreement. The accusation was mirrored this summer when a doctor said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> disconnected a tube providing nourishment to her and her fetus. <PERSON> Donahoe </PERSON> said his client was having trouble keeping food down, but attorney <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bookwalter </PERSON>, representing the fetus, said Miss <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> engaged in self-induced vomiting `` to create a medical calamity involving the unborn child.'' `` She's killed one -LRB- child -RRB- purposely,'' he said. `` She has tried to cause a premature birth of a second one. Anybody who does n't think she was trying ... to harm the two would have to be crazy. <PERSON> Donahoe </PERSON> disagrees. `` I really believe, more than anyone on this planet, she wants to bring a healthy baby into this world,'' he said. `` There might be a connection between that need ... and what she's been convicted of.'' Whatever she chooses, <PERSON> Donahoe </PERSON> says her future is bleak. The idea of sterilization `` makes her feel like she's being treated like an animal,'' he said, and if she's imprisoned, `` being kept in a cage is being kept like an animal. Her dilemma is how she's going to be treated like an animal.''

<TEXT>
 Mars' closest approach to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> in 17 years _ and the best <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION> view of the red planet in 113 years _ has backyard astronomers peering excitedly through telescopes. A network of 500 mostly amateur astronomers in 33 countries has been organized for Mars Watch'88 by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Planetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, which has dubbed the occasion `` a close encounter of the red kind.'' `` Unless you're on the North Pole or <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pole </LOCATION>, you'll get good views of Mars'' through telescopes until mid-December, said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, anesthesiologist and `` Mars recorder'' for the patrol, which is part of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lunar </ORGANIZATION> and Planetary Observers. `` You can see the surface, the clouds and the polar ice caps and really realize it is a whole world,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` Occasionally we've seen shadows cast by big dust storms. It's really neat.'' `` For observers in the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, Mars is more favorably positioned than at any time from 1875 through 2025'' because it's not only closer, but farther north in the sky than usual, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Beish </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight simulator technician in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who also collects reports for the Mars Patrol. Mars watchers already have provided 1,200 reports, photographs and sketches to <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beish </PERSON>, who send key findings to <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Propulsion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> astronomer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Edberg </PERSON>, who coordinates Mars Watch'88 during his spare time. The observations mean `` when we send cosmonauts or astronauts to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, we're going to have a better understanding of the planet,'' said <PERSON> Edberg </PERSON>. `` Mountaineers use telescopes to look at routes before they try them. The same goes for preparing for manned exploration of a planet.'' The Pasadena-based <ORGANIZATION> Planetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> is a nonprofit group lobbying for manned exploration of Mars. At 8:18 p.m. PDT on Sept. 21, <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> will be 36.54 million miles apart _ the closest since they were 34.92 million miles apart in August 1971, said telescope demonstrator <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' <ORGANIZATION> Griffith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>. Mars and Earth are close now because on Aug. 12 Mars was at perihelion _ its closest approach to the sun _ while at 8:25 p.m. PDT Sept. 27 it will reach opposition, meaning it is on the opposite side of Earth from the sun. They wo n't be so close again until Aug. 27, 2003, when they get within 34.65 million miles. They sometimes are as far as 248 million miles apart, and as far as 63 million miles apart during non-perihelion oppositions. Oppositions occur about every 26 months. But favorable, or close, oppositions, occur every 15 to 17 years. Even then, excellent views usually are available only to Southern Hemisphere residents. To the naked eye or through binoculars, Mars now is easily visible all night as a reddish-orange spark, the evening sky's second brightest object after the moon For Northern Hemisphere viewers, Mars appears low in the east-southeast after dark. At midnight, it is halfway between the southern horizon and a point directly overhead. Before dawn, it is low in the west-southwest. For Southern Hemisphere observers, Mars is in the east-northeast in the evening, appears halfway between the northern horizon and a point directly overhead at midnight, then is visible before dawn low in the west-northwest. People who want detailed views can attend telescope sessions sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Planetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, planetariums, colleges, science centers and astronomy clubs. The smallest telescopes capable of providing detailed views of Mars are 3-inch refractors or 4-inch reflectors, each with 150-power magnification, <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. Because time on big telescopes is dominated by observations of distant stars and galaxies, `` most of the round-the-clock watch of the planet is kept by amateur astronomers.'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, 49, has spent nights outdoors to watch Mars for 40 years. `` I have very bad arthritis and get mosquito bites, but I look at this damn planet and it makes my whole day,'' he said. `` I hope in my lifetime men will get to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. It's always been a dream of mine.''

<HEAD>New Pillsbury Chief Expects Flat First Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> expects its first quarter operating income to be flat, due to continued sluggish sales by its Burger King fast-food restaurant chain, the company's chairman said Tuesday. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, in his first major public appearance as the food and restaurant company's new chairman, told <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting that comparable Burger King restaurant sales were off 2 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 1989 from the same period last year. The decline extended a trend that contributed to a major restructuring in the previous year, which sharply reduced <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s net earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> had net earnings in fiscal 1988 of $ 69.3 million, or 81 cents a share, compared with $ 181.9 million, or $ 2.10 a share in fiscal 1987. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said that for the first quarter of fiscal 1989 operating results should be `` virtually flat'' although net income will be up about 25 percent because of a one-time benefit in deferred taxes. `` Foods will have an excellent first quarter, but restaurants, as I indicated, will be down because of the investment expenses we are incurring and because of continued sluggish sales at Burger King,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Besides spending $ 30 million this year to upgrade training and add new managerial staff at <LOCATION> Burger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> King </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> will begin a $ 150 million capital improvement plan to add 60 new company stores and upgrade existing stores, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` The long-term profit performance for the whole company makes it essential that we succeed, and there is no reason why we can not,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` I will be present in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> at our Burger King headquarters frequently to provide encouragement and to assist in making the right judgments with a clear sense of urgency.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he expects profit growth in the foods division during the coming fiscal years and an overall `` solid financial gain'' despite the expenses incurred to improve restaurant sales. He said the company's <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the full-service chains of Steak and Ale and <PERSON> Bennigan </PERSON>'s, experienced its first upturn in average restaurant sales in four years during the first quarter of this year. In last year's restructuring, the subsidiary dropped two small chains, got out of the hotel food service business and closed 23 underperforming Steak and Ale restaurants.

 <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, whose name is synonymous with <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, has decided to step down as chairman and chief executive officer of the business empire he launched with a $ 600 investment. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, 62, issued a statement Monday that he would not run for re-election to the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the magazine's parent company. The directors election is scheduled following <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders' meeting Nov. 10. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>, who has run the day-to-day operations of the company since 1982, is expected to be elected to the posts now held by her father, the statement said. The company also revealed it would receive a seven-figure advance from <ORGANIZATION> Bantam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Books </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is publishing <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s autobiography <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, who mortgaged his furniture and invested $ 600 of his own to publish the first issue of Playboy in December 1953, called the change `` just another evolutionary step consistent with my own personal plans.'' <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said in a statement that she hopes to expand <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s licensing, television and video businesses. `` The geographic reach of the company also will continue to be expanded,'' she said, `` with new markets such as <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> countries opening up for Playboy-licensed products, and foreign distribution of home video and television programs growing.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>, 35, who over the past six years returned the company to profitability by selling off its sour businesses, now is president, chief operating officer and vice chairwoman of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. After she becomes <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s top board executive, the company's founder will remain the major stockholder, with the titles of chairman emeritus and editor-in-chief of <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, the company's statement said `` <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> has had my full support since she took responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the company in April of 1982,'' <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> said in a statement. Under Ms. <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON>'s business direction, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> closed the last of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> key clubs and shed its interests in movie theaters, modeling and book and record clubs. <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 2.6 million profit in 1988. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnahm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, speculated <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> may have stepped down to spend less time on business and more on his fiancee, <PERSON> Kimberley </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, 26, <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION>'s Playmate of the Month for January `` In a business sense, <PERSON> Christie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hefner </PERSON> has largely been running the company for the past several years.

 <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to a $ 2.36 billion takeover by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, does n't rule out a higher offer from British publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, but some securities analysts believe his effort to acquire the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> publishing-and-information giant has been doomed. `` Being a rational person, I would think at this point he would withdraw his offer,'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Boksen </PERSON>, an investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Raymond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said Monday after <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s deal with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> was announced. `` But <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> is known to be unpredictable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION>' $ 85-a-share cash and securities acquisition, if successful, would conclude <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s struggle to thwart unwelcome takeover attempts by <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonderman </PERSON>, an official at the Bass group's headquarters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, declined to comment. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> at his <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> offices, said, `` We've received this report and are studying it.'' Wall Street reacted skeptically to whether a higher offer would emerge. <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 87 -LCB- cents a share to $ 84.75 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading on Monday. Analysts were divided on <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s next move. While some thought he would abandon his pursuit of the company, others said he could increase the bid, because his $ 84-a-share offer was so close to <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 85. `` I would not be surprised if we would see more from <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON>, who follows the publishing industry for <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` You might be able to make the argument that his all-cash of $ 84 is more attractive. If so, he's still in contention. But <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kendrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> analyst at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said: `` I think the KKR-Macmillan bid is probably the last bid. Should Maxwell come back a buck higher, there's no assurance <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON> management might not stretch their bid.'' <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s deal with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> marks another multibillion-dollar acquisition for the investment firm, a specialist in leveraged buyouts. These acquisitions _ in which a company is bought largely with borrowed funds that are repaid through its earnings, cash flow or asset sales _ remain a frenetic area of corporate takeover activity. <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> is one of the leaders, having played crucial roles in four of the biggest leveraged buyouts of the past three years. Securities analysts said the <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> acquisition also might radically alter the structure of the company, a leading publisher of educational materials with other businesses ranging from direct-mail marketing to the <ORGANIZATION> Berlitz </ORGANIZATION> chain of language training schools. Some speculated that <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> would sell either <PERSON> Macmillan </PERSON>'s publishing or information division to help finance the acquisition. Others said <PERSON> Gump </PERSON>'s, a Macmillan-owned chain of high-quality retail stores and a mail-order business, might be sold. Neither <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> nor <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> officials would speculate on the possible sale of any <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> units. Under terms of the agreement, a <LOCATION> Kolhberg </LOCATION> subsidiary will begin a tender offer of $ 85 cash per share for up to 26.1 million shares of the company, or 94 percent of the total. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> will offer a package of securities it valued at $ 85 per share for the remaining 6 percent. If all shareholders tender their shares, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> will offer them $ 80 cash and $ 5 in securities per share. The total offer values the company's 27.76 million shares at $ 2.36 billion. The Bass group, which owns about 9.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION>'s shares, had a $ 75-a-share offer outstanding for the company, but most analysts believed that was Bass's way of raising the stock's value through takeover If the Bass group sold its shares to <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> it would make about $ 75 million.

 Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wary of granting banks new securities powers are marshaling evidence to back their position by looking at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks' overseas operations. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., called a meeting of his <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> oversight subcommittee today to review a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report suggesting banks may have problems handling new powers Although banks are barred from most securities activities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> rules permit bank subsidiaries to trade and underwrite securities abroad. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, at the request of Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., looked at how large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks with European operations fared in the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> markets in 1986 and 1987 `` Bank examination reports ... indicate that most of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> securities subsidiaries of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks recorded losses or were marginally profitable,'' the report said, noting that the problems were made worse by the world stock market crash in October 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> attributed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks' poor showing in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in part to `` significant management and internal control problems.'' However, it also took note of the turbulence of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, which recently had been deregulated by the British government. Eighteen of the 50 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks operating in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> engaged in at least some securities underwriting and dealing, the watchdog agency said. In several instances during the period of the crash, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> securities subsidiaries were forced to call on their parent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks for infusions of capital to make up for losses, it said. `` This study foreshadows the threat to our banking system if banks are allowed unfettered entry into our domestic securities markets,'' said <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> finance subcommittee. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> are using the study in their efforts to counter bills that would repeal or substantially alter the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and investment banking in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent wave of bank failures. Bills granting banks new securities powers have passed the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The legislation must be reviewed by <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s committee before the full House can act.

The widely circulated <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted unidentified financial officials as saying <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> would lower tariffs on the 56 `` competitive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products to effectively ease trade tension'' between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and its chief trading partner. For each of the 56 items, U.S.-made products currently make up more than 20 percent of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s imports of that item, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Fu-jen </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> official, declined to comment on the newspaper report. Last month, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> announced it would cut import tariffs on 335 other items later this month. The newspaper said tariffs would be cut for 52 of the 175 items for which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators requested reductions during trade talks in April. However, tariffs will be cut for only two of the 102 agricultural items requested by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side because Taiwanese officials believe local farmers need protection, the newspaper said. The new items include broth, mineral oils, compressors and cooling equipment, it said. In February, tariffs on 3,500 items were cut by an average of 50 percent in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s most sweeping tariff cuts. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has been under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to reduce its large bilateral trade surplus. Trade between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year totaled $ 31.2 billion, with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s exports exceeding imports by $ 16 billion. During the first eight months of this year, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s imports from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled $ 9.3 billion, up 102 percent from a year earlier. Its bilateral trade surplus totaled $ 6.4 billion during the period.

<TEXT>
 Inflation and labor shortages are two major economic problems facing <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, Financial Secretary Piers <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, in an evaluation of the economy's performance, also slightly revised his projection of this year's growth rate to 6 percent from 5 percent, still well below the 13.5 percent rate for 1987. Interest rate increases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the slower economic growth worldwide are contributing factors in the decline in growth of the British colony's export-fueled economy, he said. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> noted, however, that the local economy `` is still operating close to capacity, so that inflation and labor shortages continue to be our two major concerns.'' He said the inflation rate was expected to hit 7.5 percent this year, slightly higher than previously projected. The unemployment rate, 1.8 percent in June, has reached historic lows, resulting in rapid increases of wages and salaries, <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> added. The government is considering easing a ban on the import of foreign labor because of the widespread labor shortages, but <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> did not say whether he favored such a move.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says the internal design of its Personal System-2 computers is the path to the future, but its rivals are heading in a different direction. <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a host of others, including <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Ing. <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co..

The new bus, dubbed EISA, for Extended Industry Standard Architecture, was unveiled today at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference. The companies expect that the first products incorporating the new bus will begin to emerge in late 1989, said <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, the president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>. Other companies pledging support to the new standard were <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the chip maker, <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the software company, and several leading makers of communications equipment and software. `` I think it -LRB- EISA -RRB- will be a problem for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizer </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said Monday. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> did misguess as to how closely its technology would be followed.'' Even <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged that not all customers want its new Micro Channel. The cheaper members of its Personal System-2 line do n't have it, and <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was expected to unveil two more of those models today. The new machines will use the same microprocessor as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s old AT and will be aggressively priced. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> fears uncontrolled copying of its technology, which would keep it from preventing shoddy knock-offs and deprive it of licensing payments to defray the expense of its research and development. But if no other company copies the internal design of the new Personal System-2 line, it wo n't become an industry standard and software developers wo n't create many programs for it. Without good software available, customers wo n't want to buy the machine. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s competitors say there is no good reason for computer buyers to adopt the Micro Channel. Analysts say <ORGANIZATION> EISA </ORGANIZATION> will speed up the movement of information but still allow computers to use older add-on equipment, such as memory cards, graphics cards and data storage devices. Customers buying <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s PS-2 have to buy all new add-on equipment, although there is less need for it because there are more built-in features. There is little <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> can do about the rival effort except try to convince computer users that its design offers more room for growth in the long run. Even if <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Micro Channel ultimately prevails, the new bus from the rival coalition is likely to slow down the development of new programs by fragmenting the efforts of software developers. Software developers may prefer to concentrate their efforts on programs for computers that do n't use Micro Channel, especially if the new bus gives them a new lease on life, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Software </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The question is whether we need to make the technological leap to the Micro Channel Architecture right now,'' said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who is also president and chief executive of Mediagenic in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Price-Fixing Charges Against American, United Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ruled that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> did not conspire to fix fees on their computerized reservation systems as several other carriers had charged. In handing down his decision Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> held that the airlines had no evidence to support any inference of conspiracy, but were relying solely on speculation. The plaintiffs, including <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, had sought more than $ 1.1 billion in recovery of such fees paid to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> from 1984 to 1987. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest airline, while American, based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, is the second biggest. `` American considers this to be a major victory,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, the airline's senior vice president and general counsel said Monday. `` We feel totally vindicated by the decision, because the judge recognized the conspiracy charges for what they are _ absolute speculation.'' In their antitrust complaint against <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, the plaintiffs contended the defendants participated in a conspiracy spanning several years to raise the other carriers' cost of doing business. Specifically, plaintiffs accused the two airlines of illegally agreeing to fix the price of `` booking fees'' charged by <ORGANIZATION> SABRE </ORGANIZATION> and Apollo _ the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> computerized reservations systems, respectively, beginning in November 1984. At that time American announced it would charge other airlines $ 1.75 per booking for the SABRE service. United later established a price of $ 1.85. The plaintiffs also alleged the two defendants unlawfully forced other carriers to pay what the industry terms `` interline ticketing fees,'' which are paid when one airline issues a ticket on its own internal `` ticket stock'' for travel on another airline, such as when a passenger's itinerary involves two or more carriers for a single trip. The court found American and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> had met their `` procedural burden'' of showing each had independently decided on the level of booking fees after November 1984 and on establishment of a reimbursement charge for interline ticketing services. On Aug. 12, <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> granted American's and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s motions for summary judgment on two of three of the plaintiffs' principal monopolization theories: that <ORGANIZATION> SABRE </ORGANIZATION> and Apollo are `` essential facilities'' and that the defendants engaged in `` monopoly leveraging.''

 Only about 400 woodworkers remain on strike at <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> mills after 1,300 others ratified a four-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> DAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> W-I </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, union leaders said. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America-U.S. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday a tentative contract approved last week was ratified Sunday by members of his union in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> also approved the agreement, according to spokesman <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>. Union members at two small wood products plants in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> are the only woodworkers still on strike. At its height, the summer woodworkers' strike idled 9,000 workers in five states in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>. IWA business agent <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> in central Oregon said the two unions voted 3-1 in favor of the contract. The agreement matched one ratified Aug. 4 by woodworkers at <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hubbell </PERSON> said. The agreement provided for $ 1,400 bonuses during the first year of the contract, plus raises totaling 11 percent in the last three years. Officials said the ratified contract reflected an improved offer by DAW and W-I. As a result of the settlement, the unions asked the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to drop an unfair labor practice charge against the two companies, officials said. The strike began June 6 and affected dozens of logging operations and lumber mills in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The unions demanded increases in basic wage rates to restore cuts accepted two years ago, when the companies sought concessions to withstand a recession in the industry. But the companies balked, offering annual bonuses and production incentives instead. The weekend settlement affects DAW plants in Bend and <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Coeur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> d'Alene </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Albeni </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>; and Superior, <PERSON> Mont </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Chain Ponders Restructuring After Hafts Get OK to Buy Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today it was exploring a $ 3.77 billion defensive restructuring that would plunge the supermarket giant into debt and force it to sell assets after the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family, well known for hostile takeover attempts, won federal clearance to acquire a chunk of the company. The nation's largest grocery chain, which operates more than 1,300 supermarkets, 900 convenience stores and other operations in 29 states, said in a statement that the possible restructuring was prompted partly by `` the high level of takeover and restructuring activity involving supermarket companies.'' The statement also mentioned a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruling Friday that allows the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION>, a Maryland-based clan of corporate takeover strategists who have unsuccessfully chased other supermarket chains but made huge profits in the process, to acquire at least $ 15 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said the restructuring would involve substantial but unspecified bank loans, pay shareholders $ 48 in cash and securities per share and allow them to keep their stock. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has about 78.57 million shares outstanding. `` The substantial debt would be repaid from cash flow from operations, disposition of non-core and underproductive assets, significant reduction in capital expenditures and reduced expenses,'' <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the Cincinnati-based company, said in the statement. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> ruling was the first official sign of the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION>' interest in <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. But the commission's statement did not say how much <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> want to buy. Representatives for the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s stock has traded heavily over the past five months partly because of rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> and other potential acquirers were interested in the company. News of the commission's decision started circulating Friday, sending <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s stock up $ 1.25 in heavy trading to close at $ 38 a share. On Monday the company's stock closed up another $ 1.50 at $ 39.50, also on heavy trading. One analyst predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> would likely break up Kroger if they purchased it. `` It's almost certain that they'll start dismantling the company and selling off its assets,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON>, vice president at <LOCATION> Rotan-Mosle </LOCATION>, a Houston-based subsidiary of the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But, <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON> also said that <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> and his father, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, who operate the <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, may be serious about running a grocery company. They demonstrated that earlier this spring, when they bought a small <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, grocery chain. Instead of selling it off for the cash, the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> are using the company to learn how to manage a grocery firm, <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> have failed in their efforts to buy such companies as <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>, Supermarkets General and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Shop, but have made profits in selling stock shares back to those companies.

 A contraption that sucks bad bugs off strawberry plants may become a handy tool for farmers in the drive to kill pests without using so many chemicals. Three farming members of <ORGANIZATION> Driscoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strawberry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, are using a company-designed machine called a BugVac this year to vacuum lygus bugs off their plants. The custom-made vacuum machine, mounted on a tractor, moves down rows of young berries, providing just enough suction to zap lygus bugs that like to live near the top of the plants. Beneficial insects that live lower on the plants are not disturbed by the machine, explained <PERSON> Driscoll </PERSON> researcher Ed Show. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> leaves and the ripening fruit also are left unharmed. Show adapted the idea from a hand vacuum the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> developed years ago to test the levels of insect populations. The researcher's innovation consists of hydraulically driven fans and suction hoses. `` The vacuum does n't deep clean the whole strawberry plant,'' Show said in an interview. `` We're affecting only the bugs on the top part of the plant. It will suck up and remove bugs of all kinds, the good and the bad, but it's not as detrimental to the beneficial insect community.'' Perhaps the main benefit from the BugVac is saving the beneficial insects needed to eat other damaging bugs such as western spider mites, which have become resistant to pesticides. `` We have no effective miticides to control spider mites, so if we spray for lygus bugs, we create a real spider mite problem because we knock out the beneficial insects,'' Show says. Vacuum cleaning the plants does not eliminate as many lygus bugs as spraying them with pesticides would. However, growers who tried the new technique were able to keep the lygus bug population close to or slightly below what is termed the economic threshold in integrated pest management _ the level at which the pest population causes financial losses. `` We're learning how many lygus bugs we can get away with in a field,'' Show said. The board of <ORGANIZATION> Driscoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which provides its own patented strawberry varieties to affiliated growers, asked Show to find ways to reduce or eliminate as much use of pesticides as possible because of increasing regulatory restrictions, increasing resistance by bugs to some chemicals and doubts about whether adequate new chemicals will become available. Show decided to adapt the DVac machine, a hand-held or backpack device used to suck up small numbers of pests in estimating how badly a field is infested. `` Given that basic idea, we built a prototype on bicycle wheels, pushed it through test plots and found it could catch what seemed like an impressive number of lygus bugs,'' Show said. This was the first season growers used Show's device commercially, and the three who had machines built seem satisfied with the results. Reiter Affiliated of <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> used a BugVac on 71 acres of strawberries at <LOCATION> Salinas </LOCATION>, about 125 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and plans to have two more machines built for use on all of the company's 225 acres next year. General manager <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> estimates the vacuum machine saved $ 100 - $ 200 an acre over the cost of pesticides, and owner <PERSON> Miles </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiter </PERSON> said the savings may even be higher `` It's been a real good deal for us,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCluney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, who manufactures the BugVacs, says he's now built nine or 10 and has orders for at least that many more with still other farmers considering the device. The cost of the machines runs between $ 12,000 and $ 17,000. `` It definitely does work under most circumstances when properly used with integrated pest management and other methods,'' <PERSON> McCluney </PERSON> said. `` It's not just a replacement for a spray tractor but needs to be in conjunction with predator releases.'' Use of the BugVac may spread from strawberries to other <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vegetables, such as lettuce. `` There's interest on the part of some other vegetable growers,'' said Show, adding that he has heard of at least one <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> farmer who uses a similar apparatus to control potato beetles. <PERSON> McCluney </PERSON> said he plans a trip to <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> in southeastern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` to see if we can use this new idea to help out with their white fly problem.''

<HEAD>Corn, Soybeans Open Lower; Wheat Rallies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn and soybean futures opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> while wheat traded higher, all in reaction to Monday's crop production report from <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The government's new harvest projections of 4.46 billion bushels of corn and 1.47 billion bushels of soybeans were higher than the market had expected, prompting many players to sell contracts for future delivery of those commodities, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s wheat production number _ 1.81 billion bushels _ also was higher than expected. But its bearish implications were more than offset by new government predictions of lower grain production in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and a forecast for increased grain imports by the Soviets. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is negotiating a new long-term agreement to supply grain to the Soviets. Demand concerns have replaced supply fears as the main influence on crop futures prices and will continue to dominate trading as the corn and soybean harvest progresses, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The key is how is the demand going to respond, when are the spurts of business going to come, how is the market going to handle the fact that over the next 60 days we are going to be harvesting and maximizing the supply side in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' he said. In early trading, wheat was 3 \ cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.08 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.85 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.75 a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 8 cents lower with September at $ 8.66 a bushel Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .22 cent to .48 cent higher with October at 70.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .50 cent lower to .05 cent higher with September at 79.15 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .68 cent higher with October at 38.40 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .08 cent to 1.23 cents higher with February at 47.50 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Monday.

<HEAD>Fine Tuning for High Strength, Japan Leading The Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EARL BOHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After learning from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> about modern furnaces, enlightened labor relations and customer service, American steelmakers are once again looking across the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> _ this time for a steel process that may help protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships at sea and tanks on land. High-strength, low-alloy steel plate _ easier to weld, less dependent on hard-to-get alloying elements and potentially cheaper to make _ is the latest fruit of the Japanese industrial system. `` It's the wave of the future,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Null </PERSON>, head of the metals branch of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s Sea Systems Command. American steelmakers lag <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by 10 to 15 years in the computer-controlled processing needed to make the super-tough steel. But the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is anxious to catch up. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> wants to build ships out of world-class steel. They want the best that money can buy, and they're willing to pay for it,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>, a steel specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, formerly the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>. `` But right now, the American steel plate producers do n't have all the technical tools available to them,'' <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, office. Besides the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s support, the Army is interested in the new plate for its armored vehicles. The material has applications in commercial shipping as well. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> hopes to win its request for $ 5.5 million in the 1989 defense budget to send American steel to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for processing and to bring it back for testing. If the plate meets specifications and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> appropriates more money, the department would negotiate with domestic steel companies for one of them to upgrade a plate mill with the new technology in exchange for guaranteed sales. `` We're very excited about this project. I think it has a great deal of potential for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> steel industry,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Corridore </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> industrial specialist who heads the program. <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> said the reasons American steelmakers lag the Japanese in this area are intertwined with the forces that helped undermine <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s postwar industrial power. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> steelmakers invested early on in research that led to computerized processing, the key to more precise manipulating of steel's metallurgical properties as the metal is heated, cooled, squeezed and stretched. By 1983, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s five major plate makers were using controlled cooling, which helps reduce the need for alloying steel with niobium, molybdenum and other elements that make the finished plates tricky to weld. It's the heart of the technology the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> is willing to pay American steelmakers to adopt. It is a follow-up technology to controlled rolling, which the Japanese commercialized in the late 1960s. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> adopted that in the 1980s, <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the industry is being stubborn or hard-headed or ignorant by not adopting this technology,'' <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> said. `` The technology is not that attractive from a commercial standpoint.'' `` We're not stupid in this country despite what you read,'' said <PERSON> Marshal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>, manager of government programs for <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading plate maker. `` We've been aware of this technology for a long time. But we're a free market economy, and we do n't always have access to all the capital that you need to invest in technology `` That situation has n't always presented itself to our trading partners, so it's real easy for the Japanese with easy access to capital to go down their wish list and made a decision to proceed,'' <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said. Without government underwriting, `` there's no way you can justify putting these units in,'' said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardo </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardo </PERSON>, however, is not a fan of the new Japanese technology and thinks the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> should be looking to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> labs for help. `` I think the Pentagon has been sold a bill of goods on this,'' he said. `` But I give them the benefit of the doubt. They really believe they're doing something that's correct.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Ardo </PERSON> said Japanese steelmakers `` have shown the benefits of accelerated cooling to much of our military, and there's no question that what they're saying is true. It's just that I think our steel industry needs many things to benefit the military before they get to an accelerated cooling unit.'' Controlled cooling, also called accelerated cooling, involves computers calculating exactly when to spray water on a hot plate as it emerges in its final shape from a rolling mill. `` But it's not that simple,'' said <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON>, who recommended high-strength, low-alloy steel to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> after studying the new process for a year in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The computer ... controls when the cooling starts and when the cooling stops, what the volume of water is, what the distribution of water is from side to side and what the rate of travel of the plate through this shower is,'' he said. The Japanese coupled that technique to direct rolling, in which molten steel is cast into 8-inch thick slabs, then rolled directly into plate an inch or so thick. The method eliminates the time - and energy-consuming steps of cooling the slabs to room temperature to be inspected, cleaned of surface defects and reheated It is possible only with steel of precise and consistent composition, itself a benefit of computer-controlled furnaces. Together, those processes allow for reductions in alloying elements, including chromium and vanadium which the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> control. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> developed the processes to supply to its busy fabricators, who produce off-shore drilling platforms and transcontinental pipelines.

 <ORGANIZATION> McCormick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell its real estate subsidiary for about $ 550 million to a joint venture of the <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annuity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ransom </PERSON> <PERSON> 2nd </PERSON>, senior vice president of the institutional research department of the Baltimore-based brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Baker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday the sale of <ORGANIZATION> McCormick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> would give the spice giant a pretax gain of more than $ 200 million. <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> is the world's largest spice manufacturer, with 1987 sales of $ 1.1 billion. The deal will substantially boost <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>'s stock value while allowing it `` to focus on the work that is closest to its core business _ the food, spice, flavorings, extracts business,'' Ransom said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>'s vice president and chief financial officer, said the company has no firm plans for what it will do with the cash. `` Our highest priority is an acquisition or acquisitions in our core businesses, including the consumer products area, and also in the food service area,'' he said. `` Other uses we've thought about include the retirement of debt and stock repurchases.'' The purchase gives <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>, a real estate company, an opportunity to diversify into office, industrial, and research and development properties in the <LOCATION> Baltimore-Washington </LOCATION> corridor. The sale involves all <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>'s real estate holdings, which amount to about 9 million square feet of office space, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichtenauer </PERSON>, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> spokesman. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the year. <PERSON> Mathias </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said the deal was being financed by the <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Annuity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a large pension fund plan for college and high school teachers that has financed or participated in joint ventures with other Rouse projects.

 Stock prices moved higher Tuesday as the market was buoyed by developments in the oil sector. Confidence was given a much needed boost by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which staged a `` dawn raid,'' scooping up shares in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Scottish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION>. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed up 11.7 points, or 0.7 percent, at 1,756.3. Trading volume was 369.2 million shares, compared with 213.2 million shares traded during Monday's session. Although British Gas failed to achieve its target of aquiring a 14.9-percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION>, the hectic buying and the general speculation surrounding the raid helped the whole oil sector and share prices generally. `` You can see what happens to this market when there's a little bit of good news,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Charlesworth </PERSON>, senior dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The market has lately been plagued by confusion over the near-term direction for equities and by particularly low levels of participation. The raid on <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION> started before the official market opening, with the brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Hoare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Govett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> offering to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION> shares on behalf of British Gas at 480 pence, or $ 8.16, apiece, well above Monday's closing <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION> price of 390 pence. <PERSON> Hoare </PERSON> <PERSON> Govett </PERSON> said it obtained a small amount of <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. The raid sparked speculation of a forthcoming takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION>. Takeover speculation also surrounded <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, another independent British oil company, because of <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION>'s 25 percent holding in Enterprise. A successful bidder for <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION> could use the Enterprise holding as a platform for a bid for Enterprise as well, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION> shares surged to close at 543 pence, a jump of 153 pence. Enterprise closed 126 pence higher at 562 pence.

 The stock market was lower in early trading today, lacking momentum as traders waited for Wednesday's report on the nation's merchandise trade deficit for July. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 3.56 points at 2,068.81 at 2 p.m. EDT, having bounced back from an early fall of 10.31 points and then stayed in a narrow range. Declining issues outnumbered advances by around 7-to-5, with 749 issues down, 559 up and 536 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 119.05 million shares. Activity was said to be dampened, though less so than on Monday, by the observance of the Jewish New Year holiday. `` Rip <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON> would love this one,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's like watching paint dry on the walls.'' Analysts said the overall market was dragged down early in the session by negative news affecting shares of semiconductor companies, including <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s reported loss Monday of $ 30.5 million in its first fiscal quarter. Shares of National Semiconductor, one of the most actively traded companies, were down -RCB- at 8 -RRB-. `` That sent the whole group into a tailspin,'' said <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Execs: Drought Hurt River Barge Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Executives of river barge companies say this summer's drought stalled their efforts to recover from some lean years. After a severe recession in the early 1980s, when some barge lines merged and others went broke, the companies saw 1988 as the year to cap a comeback. But they have been unpleasantly surprised by mounting losses. `` Finally this year, people began to make money until <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Nature </PERSON> gave us a lousy deal,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, vice president of the trade group <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waterways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. A study commissioned by the trade group projected the industry this year will suffer losses of as much as $ 200 million on revenue of $ 1 billion, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Operating costs of barge companies have soared while many of the rates are fixed by long-term contracts, officials said. The barge industry struggled as a whole from 1982 to 1986, when an oversupply of barges depressed hauling rates. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had proposed several bills that would help the industry by tax deferrals or direct subsidies, but in August the industry announced it wanted no help, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Commercial traffic on the dam-regulated <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> has continued without a hitch despite the summer drought, but shallow water in the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> has tied up barges and $ 7,000-a-day towboats. Travel time for barges has doubled this summer. In addition, special drought restrictions reduced by half the number of barges that are allowed to be lashed together, requiring barge companies to use more tow boats. The restrictions also limit the load each barge can carry. `` A turnaround year turned into a real dumper,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, where the price of barge transportation for grain is determined in trade. Slower travel and the smaller loads caused a shortage of barges and boats this summer, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hain </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> M-G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> barge company. `` It was difficult to quote prices because there were n't any barges available,'' he said. He said there was a substantial decline in company profits this summer. At <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another Cincinnati-based line, profits will be down although the company will still make money, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Frasher </PERSON>, vice president of operations. `` This -LRB- drought -RRB- was not needed at this time,'' <PERSON> Frasher </PERSON> said.

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 6.58 points at 2,078.95 at 3 p.m. EDT, having bounced back from an early fall of 10.31 points and then stayed in a narrow range. Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advances, with 711 issues down, 639 up and 543 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> totaled 138.58 million shares. Activity was said to be dampened, though less so than on Monday, by the observance of the Jewish New Year holiday. `` Rip <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON> would love this one,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's like watching paint dry on the walls.'' Analysts said the overall market was dragged down early in the session by negative news affecting shares of semiconductor companies, including <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s loss reported Monday of $ 30.5 million in its first fiscal quarter. `` That sent the whole group into a tailspin,'' said <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Shares of National Semiconductor, one of the most actively traded companies, were down -RCB- at 8 -RRB- The market continues to await Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report on the merchandise trade deficit for July. The announcement early today that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current-account deficit shrank by 9.8 percent in the second quarter to $ 33.3 billion had little impact since it is a less recent reading of the trade picture. The current account is the broadest measure of a country's trade, while the July merchandise trade report will be a more narrow and recent indicator `` They're waiting for a signal, either from the outside world or from the market itself,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The market lacks real conviction, real direction.'' Most observers expect the July report to show a merchandise trade gap of around $ 11.5 billion to $ 12.5 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was down 0.29 at 150.92.

 Crop futures prices closed mostly higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as strength from the buoyant wheat market spilled over into the corn and soybean pits. Corn and soybean futures had opened lower in reaction to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s higher-than-expected harvest estimates, issued after the close of trading on Monday. The report estimated 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn production at 4.46 billion bushels and soybean production at 1.47 billion bushels. The numbers represent sharp declines from last year's production levels because of drought damage, but were still above most private forecasts. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s wheat-production estimate also was higher than expected but wheat futures prices rallied on the report's predictions of declining Soviet and Canadian wheat production and increasing Soviet grain imports Tuesday's market performance `` is a reflection of the fact that while everyone was focused on the disappointing numbers put out by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> domestically, the world numbers for wheat came out friendly,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 9 -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.11 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 2 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.85 a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.64 a bushel; soybeans were 5 -LCB- cents to 8 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 8.76 a bushel.

 The stock market finished higher in mostly sluggish trading today, getting a last-minute boost from remarks by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary designate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>.

<HEAD>IBM's Rivals Declare Their Independence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nine personal computer makers declared their independence from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday with a new standard for how information will be passed around inside their machines. Analysts said the announcement of the new `` bus,'' or data pathway, killed for good the lingering idea that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> would control the standards for the next generation of personal computers. `` It's <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and the rest of us,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Krause </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> 3Com </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes communications software for machines made by both <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and its rivals. In an unusually busy day for the computer industry, there were these other important developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> would link up with a former nemesis, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jobs </PERSON>, the co-founder of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> It said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> will spend $ 10 million for a license to use technology developed by Jobs' new company, <ORGANIZATION> Next </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> announced a way for its most advanced personal computers to run the huge library of programs written for its System 36 minicomputers It also introduced three improved models of its 9370 minicomputers and two fast but inexpensive members of its Personal System-2 family. _ <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> opened its annual DEC World show in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, by unveiling plans to expand its business of helping companies plan and manage their computer and communications systems At the same time, it announced a way to monitor and manage an entire far-flung computer network from a single point. _ <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Garden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, the world's largest independent software company, announced agreement on a $ 170 million purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, from <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based telephone holding company The nine companies that gathered for a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference have agreed on standards for a bus, which specifies the way information is passed between the processor, keyboard, screen, memory and other components. The capabilities of the new bus, which had been kept secret, exceeded the expectations of many industry watchers. The companies said it will outperform <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Micro Channel in several respects, including the speed at which it can handle bursts of data. Tuesday's announcement was important because it helped set standards that will last into the 1990s, when advanced personal computers will be as fast as today's fastest mainframe computers. `` This is a great day for the industry,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahlman </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Sanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Micro Channel is now just one of a number of alternatives.'' It appears that there will be three main competitors in coming years: the Micro Channel inside advanced models of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Personal System-2; the NuBus inside advanced models of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Macintosh, and the bus announced Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> EISA </ORGANIZATION>, for Extended Industry Standard Architecture Although <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is believed to have been a main instigator of the project, it played down its role. `` It just gained momentum. I do n't think you can single out any one or even a few companies,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Canion </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, which soared into the Fortune 500 in record time by successfully challenging <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in personal computers. Computers built on the new bus will not be available until the second half of 1989. That gives <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> time to convince customers that if they want a more powerful bus, they should buy an <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> Personal System-2, which is already on the market. `` My question is, if you're going to buy a machine today, would n't you want to buy a machine that has those advanced capabilities today?'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for software marketing. For buyers of personal computers, the differences between the Personal System-2 and the competitors' machines will be hard to detect, especially within the next few years. <PERSON> Canion </PERSON> estimated that 98 percent of programs developed for one kind of computer would run on the others without modification. The main exception would be communications software. The nine companies agreed to share any patents on the new bus among themselves and offer free licenses to any other companies that want to use it. The only charge to companies will be $ 2,500 to cover paperwork and lawyers' fees. The other eight originators of the standard are <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> AST </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wyse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Ing. <ORGANIZATION> C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olivetti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. SpA, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Epson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Other major contributors to the project are <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which are also major suppliers to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, of chips and software, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, the venture capitalist and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, said the coalition of so many rivals was unprecedented: `` It's one of the major events in the history of the PC industry,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Strengthens Slightly, Gold Is Mixed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar strengthened mildly against most key currencies Tuesday, but money brokers said trading remained light in advance of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s July trade deficit report. Gold was narrowly mixed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after rising abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted gold at $ 420.90 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 45 cents from the late Monday price. Currency market strategists said the dollar may have received a slight boost from comments on the nation's trade deficit by investment banker <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings on his nomination to be treasury secretary. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s allusions to the narrowing deficit were interpreted by some traders as a sign that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was not overly concerned with the dollar's current level, which took some selling pressure off the currency. Nevertheless, the level of trading remained sluggish due to the unpredictable market impact of the trade deficit statistics to be released Wednesday morning. The consensus in the currency market is for a deficit of about $ 11.5 billion, vs. $ 12.54 billion for June, but the trade data are one of the most difficult statistics to predict. `` People are very reluctant to do much ahead of that number,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chorek </PERSON>, a currency analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Money </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> investment and financial information concern. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 133.07 Japanese yen, down from 133.42 yen Monday. But later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar rebounded to 133.30 yen, and by the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar strengthened to 133.37 yen, up slightly from 133.35 yen Monday. The British pound cost $ 1.6965 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Tuesday, more expensive than $ 1.6958 late Monday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound weakened further to $ 1.6940, vs. $ 1.6974 late Monday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> vs. levels late Monday: 1.8534 West German marks, up from 1.8464; 1.5609 Swiss francs, up from 1.5540; 1.2284 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2367; 6.2950 French francs, up from 6.2815; and 1,383.50 Italian lire, up from 1,378.85. Late rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Monday: 1.8470 West German marks, up from 1.8453; 1.5600 Swiss francs, up from 1.5535; 6.2935 French francs, up from 6.2775; 2.0845 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0817; 1,380.50 Italian lire, up from 1,378.50; and 1.2307 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2395. Gold bullion prices moved higher abroad in a recovery from low levels Monday, when the price fell below $ 420 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for the first time this year, undermined by weaker prices for oil and other commodities. Gold closed in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 420, up from $ 419.25; in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> at $ 421, up from $ 418; and in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> at $ 422.69, up from $ 419.18. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold for current delivery rose 30 cents to $ 421.50. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 6.46 a troy ounce, up from $ 6.41. On the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Comex </LOCATION>, silver for current delivery rose 4 cents to $ 6.477.

 <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s huge annual product show opened Tuesday in this French Riviera city, and the company announced a major new thrust into the business of planning and managing customers' computer systems. The fifth annual DEC World, described by the company as the world's biggest single-vendor information exhibition, is also the first of the series to be held outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Related exhibitions will start Wednesday in 11 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities. Digital said it would be the only company to help customers at every stage of their operations, from deciding how to set up computer networks to overseeing their maintenance once installed. The Maynard, Mass.-based computer maker will offer to be the single point of contact for its customers, although it will subcontract some of the work to specialists, it said. The field being pursued by <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>, known as systems integration, is one of the fastest-growing segments of the computer industry and is already being actively pursued by such companies as <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, and most of the Big Eight accounting firms In a related announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> said it had developed a way for computer users to oversee and manage complex networks of computers, even ones made by other companies and widely separated from each other. The software that went into the management system was the biggest software development project <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> has undertaken in the past decade, aside from improving its own operating system, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Low </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> executive, said in an interview in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Low </PERSON> said seven companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Timeplex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, have already agreed to make modifications that will allow their software to be controlled by <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s management system. He said 100 others have expressed interest in doing the same. Digital is the world's second-biggest computer company after <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>. The company said <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'88 involves more than $ 65 million worth of computer equipment, an exhibit space the size of 15 tennis courts and more than 350 demonstrations at the Palais <PERSON> des </PERSON> <PERSON> Congres </PERSON> running until Sept. 23. The exhibition is expected to attract 18,000 visitors in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> and 5,000 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. At <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s 11 <ORGANIZATION> Application </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, there will be demonstrations similar to those taking place in <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION>. The purpose of <ORGANIZATION> DEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> is to show companies how to gain and keep a competitive advantage by making the most effective use of the latest information technology. The exhibits are arranged by industry and focus on manufacturing, financial services, the service industries, tleecommunications and the public sector.

The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is paying $ 10 million for the right to use the symbols and commands with which the user will interact with Jobs' new computer. Industry executives said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> plans to use the Jobs technology _ which controls the `` look and feel'' of the machines _ on computers that run the Unix operating system. Jobs has said the Next computer was initially designed for college students and academic researchers, although analysts said they now believe he envisions a wider market for the computer. Analysts noted that Jobs faces a much tougher environment for startups than when he founded Apple in nearby <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION> more than 11 years ago. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> have set high computer standards, and those two companies and <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Microsystems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> have successfully wooed the specialized academic market for years.. `` He's got to have something that really sets it apart, something that lights a fire,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lampesis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> said Monday For years, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was the major rival of Jobs in efforts to dominate of the personal computer industry while Jobs headed Apple. When he lost a bitter battle three years ago with <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sculley </PERSON> and was ousted from the company, Jobs set out to invent a new personal computer as significant as the Apple Macintosh. The yet-unnamed Next computer is expected to have a number of features not available on current personal computers, such as a high-speed facsimile modem, powerful digital sound processing capabilities, an erasable compact disc player for data storage and retrieval and the ability to display television-quality video signals. Jobs may face legal obstacles in his effort to establish his new machine on the market. Apple sued Jobs in 1985 and, as part of a settlement, won the right to inspect the Next machine for possible trade secret violations. Apple says Jobs has given only `` partial compliance.'' `` We still reserve the right for further evaluation of the product,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Carleen </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVasseur </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, Next's spokeswoman, expressed surprise at <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s claim, saying she believed <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> had `` signed off on the machine. `` As far as Next is concerned, they've fulfilled everything they have to do,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. But Jobs' strong credibility in the industry and the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> connection make experts reluctant to say he ca n't clear the hurdles ahead of him. `` Steve is <PERSON> Steve </PERSON>. Whatever he does is of great interest to people,'' said <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Povejsil </PERSON>, academic solutions manager at Apple. At universities, she said, `` I get the impression there is a real wait-and-see attitude. They've been promised a lot, and they'd like to see the goods.

 The stock market finished higher Tuesday in mostly sluggish trading, getting a last-minute boost from remarks by <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary designate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. The statements touched off a late buying wave led by blue-chip issues, after stocks had traded slightly lower through most of he session. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended 10.67 points higher at 2,083.04. The closely watched blue-chip indicator fell 10.31 points soon after the opening, recovered a bit and then stayed in a narrow range until shortly before the close. In the broader market, advancing issues narrowly outnumbered declines in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 705 issues up, 681 down and 545 unchanged. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, an investment banker nominated by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to replace former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, said at his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing that he expects the nation's trade deficit to decline at a `` surprisingly fast'' pace over the next few years. Analysts said Wall Street interpreted <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s comments as hinting that Wednesday's scheduled government report on the merchandise trade report for July would be encouraging. `` I think the comment helped,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who later was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for consideration by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, also said he sees no reason at this time for raising taxes <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s nomination is widely expected to be approved. Market activity had been stalled as participants awaited the July trade report, and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s remarks gave the lackluster market a lift, analysts said. Volume also was dampened, though less so than on Monday, by the observance of the Jewish New Year holiday. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> totaled 162.49 million shares, up from 114.88 million in Monday's session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 187.86 million shares. `` Rip <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkle </PERSON> would love this one,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Raftery </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said early in the session. `` It's like watching paint dry on the walls.'' Analysts said the overall market was dragged down in the early going by negative news affecting shares of semiconductor companies, including <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s loss of $ 30.5 million in its first fiscal quarter. `` That sent the whole group into a tailspin,'' said <PERSON> Hildegarde </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagorski </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Shares of National Semiconductor, one of the most actively traded companies, fell | to 8 -LCB- The announcement early Tuesday that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current-account deficit shrank by 9.8 percent in the second quarter to $ 33.3 billion had little impact since it is a less recent reading of the trade picture than Wednesday's report. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> index rose 0.52 to 151.15. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 1.20 to 306.95, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 0.96 at 267.43.

<HEAD>Cotton Futures Soar On Hurricane Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Cotton futures prices soared Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on fears that heavy rains from Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> could damage the cotton crop in central and western <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. On other markets, prices for future delivery of oil and oil products, grains, soybeans, copper, gold, silver and livestock all finished higher. Stock-index futures also advanced. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was heading toward <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> on Tuesday after devastating <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Some cotton traders feared that strong winds and rain from the savage storm would reach deep into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` They know it will go into the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> tomorrow and move into the south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> coastal areas,'' said <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, cotton specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said traders feared the storm would strike land between <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, turn north and pour rain on cotton fields in the state's central and western portions. If that happens, he said. `` it will lower the grade, it may even cause some loss.'' Despite the heavy buying prompted by <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s approach, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said the loss of even 500,000 bales of cotton would have little impact on the glutted cotton market. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated that stocks of cotton next July 31, the end of the current marketing year, would total 8.2 million bales compared with 5.6 million bales at the end of the 1987-88 year. `` If this storm does something, it is meaningless in the overall context of the cotton crop we have,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>. `` We still have a huge surplus of cotton.'' Cotton settled 1.24 cents to 1.55 cents higher with the contract for delivery in October at 55.49 cents a pound. Fears that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> could force a temporary halt to gasoline production at oil refineries in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> helped spur energy futures to higher levels on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, analysts said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 12 cents higher with October at $ 14.56 a barrel; heating oil was .12 cent to .15 cent higher with October at 41.83 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .02 cent to 1.19 cents higher with October at 43.81 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures prices finished mostly higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as strength from the buoyant wheat market spilled over into the corn and soybean pits. Corn and soybean futures had opened lower in reaction to higher-than-expected harvest estimates for those crops contained in an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report released Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s wheat production estimate also was higher than expected but wheat futures prices rallied on the report's predictions of declining Soviet and Canadian wheat production and increasing Soviet grain imports, analysts said With potential crop-weather problems developing in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and severe crop losses a hard fact in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, `` the world situation is still tight'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 3 cents to 9 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 4.11 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent lower to 3 cents higher with September at $ 2.85 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 4 cents higher with September at $ 2.65 a bushel; soybeans were 5 -LCB- cents to 11 cents higher with September at $ 8.76 a bushel. Copper contracts for near-term delivery advanced for the sixth straight day on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in response to continued strong demand and tightening supplies, analysts said. `` There is a legitimate shortage of high-grade copper and indications you really are running into a supply-demand imbalance,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Syphen </PERSON>, manager of the metals futures desk of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Copper settled .60 cent to 2.20 cents higher with September at $ 1.0890 a pound. Precious-metals futures also gained modestly on the Comex, with silver's relative gains outpacing gold's. Gold settled 10 cents to 30 cents higher with October at $ 422.90 a troy ounce; silver was 4 cents to 4.5 cents higher with September at $ 6.477 a troy ounce. Most livestock and meat futures rallied on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on buying that was mainly due to technical factors, analysts said. Live cattle settled .30 cent to .90 cent higher with October at 70.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent lower to .25 cent higher with September at 79.32 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower to .85 cent higher with October at 38.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .88 cent to 1.23 cent higher with February at 48.15 cents a pound. Stock-index futures advanced modestly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.85 points higher at 268.

 <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it was considering a $ 3.77 billion restructuring plan, but said the proposal was not specifically designed to ward off a possible hostile takeover bid by <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest grocery chains, said it was asking its board of directors to approve a plan that would plunge the company into debt but keep it publicly owned. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has 1,300 supermarkets and other operations in 29 states. The announcement sent <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock soaring $ 11.75 a share to $ 51.25 in nationwide trading of issues listed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ruling on Friday allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> to acquire at least $ 15 million worth of <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> stock. The Hafts, who control <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Landover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, are corporate takeover strategists and have unsuccessfully chased other supermarket chains but made huge profits in the process. `` This restructuring is not specifically tailored to the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> situation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said. `` We take it seriously. But ever since the market became competitive in 1985 or 1986, we've been pretty vigilant about this. We want to keep <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> an independent and public company.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said the restructuring would involve substantial but unspecified bank loans, paying shareholders $ 48 in cash and securities per share and allowing them to keep their stock. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has about 78.57 million shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> said it will repay the loans using cash flow from operations, reducing expenses and selling assets. In a 1986 restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> sold its chain of SupeRx retail drugstores, and <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has worked since July to sell off its unprofitable chain of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Choice supermarkets and liquor stores in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` This is a case of extending that process,'' <PERSON> Bernish </PERSON> said. `` Our review of assets will be heightened if this plan is approved.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> ruling was the first official sign of the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION>' interest in <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment. Supermarket industry analysts said the restructuring plan was a positive step for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>. `` This has been an option for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> for a long time. It is not necessarily a response to the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> announcement, but the <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> family move was a catalyst,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiels </PERSON>, analyst for the investment firm <PERSON> Hilliard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> has been looking for ways to reward its stockholders,'' she said. `` This restructuring allows the company to stay public ... This is a prudent move for <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>'s stock has traded heavily over the past five months, partly because of rumors the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> and other potential acquirers were interested in the company. If the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> were to take over <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION>, `` It's almost certain that they'll start dismantling the company and selling off its assets,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON>, vice president at <LOCATION> Rotan-Mosle </LOCATION>, a Houston-based investment firm. But <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> may be serious about running a grocery company. They demonstrated that earlier this spring when they bought a small <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, grocery chain. Instead of selling it off for the cash, the <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> are using the company to learn how to manage a grocery firm, <PERSON> Giblen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Hafts </ORGANIZATION> have failed in their efforts to buy such companies as <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Supermarkets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> but have profited in selling stock back to those companies.

 Woodworkers have ratified a new four-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a union spokesman said Tuesday. About 6,000 union woodworkers in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> approved the pact, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woodworkers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America-U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> IWA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> is nearly identical to contracts negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Boise-Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Champion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> MacRae </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Peace in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two-week Post Office strike appeared in the balance Tuesday night as thousands of workers stayed off the job despite Monday's settlement of the dispute. It was still impossible to post a letter in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> where mail boxes remained sealed. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said work had begun on clearing 150 million letters and packages backed up in the system. Although it expected a full return to work by Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said it could be two weeks before service was restored to normal. As night shifts began, it estimated that 20,000 of the 100,000 strikers had returned to work. It said another 40,000 worked during the strike. <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON>, general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said agreement was reached Monday on the issue of regional pay bonuses but the key issue of whether union members would allow casual workers to handle the mail backlog had been left to local negotiations. He said the union would back members remaining on strike if they could not agree terms on casual labor and overtime with Post Office local managers. The union said half the country's 15,000 sorting offices were still on strike and only six of the 82 major sorting centers were working. It said staff at <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> had voted to stay out and similar decisions were expected at other offices. The strike began as a 24-hour walkout on Aug. 31 against the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> desire to pay bonuses to new workers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> where the cost of living is high and retaining workers difficult. The union wanted the bonuses paid nationally. Strikes mushroomed Sept. 1 when the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> tried to bring in workers to clear the mail backlog. <PERSON> Tuffin </PERSON> said Monday the bonus system had been accepted until a new one could be worked out in about six weeks.

<TEXT>
 The deficit in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade narrowed sharply from April through June as overseas sales of American merchandise surged to a record high, the government reported Tuesday. However, the good news was tempered by the fact that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> suffered its first deficit in three decades in the trade category which includes investment earnings. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit in the current account shrank to $ 33.3 billion in the second quarter, a 9.8 percent improvement from a first quarter imbalance of $ 36.9 billion. It was the biggest quarterly improvement since a 20.1 percent drop in the final three months of last year. The current account is the most important of all the government's trade statistics because it covers not only trade in merchandise but also trade in services, which primarily reflect the flow of investment earnings between countries. The improvement in the second quarter current account deficit occurred because the deficit in merchandise trade fell to $ 29.9 billion, down from $ 35.2 billion in the first quarter, as exports rose to a record level and imports posted the first quarterly decline in three years. This improvement was offset by a $ 492 million imbalance in services, which meant that foreigners earned more on their investments during the quarter than Americans earned on overseas investments. Also adding to the current account deficit was $ 2.9 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> payments for foreign aid and pensions to Americans living overseas. For the first six months of this year, the current account deficit has been running at an annual rate of $ 140.5 billion, a substantial improvement from a record deficit of $ 154 billion in 1987. The improvement has come about because of a boom in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports, reflecting declines in the value of the dollar since 1985 which have made American goods competitive once again on overseas markets. The export rebound has translated into hefty job gains in American manufacturing which the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration hopes will benefit Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential chances. However, Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has charged that the surge in trade deficits this decade and the resulting growth in foreign debt is one of the major failures of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> economic program. The current account was last in surplus in 1981, a year in which Americans' earnings on overseas investments were enough to offset a deficit in merchandise trade. Since that time, Americans have handed over billions of dollars to foreigners in exchange for imported goods, transforming the country from the world's largest creditor nation to the world's largest debtor country That means that foreigners now own more in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investments than Americans hold in foreign investments. This transfer of wealth was reflected in the second quarter deficit in the services category, the first deficit in this category since 1958. The services deficit is small enough that it could be revised away in future reports. Three months ago, the government said that the services category posted a deficit of $ 655 million in the first quarter. That was revised in Tuesday's report to show a surplus of $ 1.4 billion. But economists said the trend is clear. With foreign holdings in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rising rapidly, the investment category will soon turn negative and will stay in the red for some time. The congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> held a hearing on the trade deficits Tuesday and heard a panel of economists urge further action to cut federal budget deficits as a way of slowing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic demand and further reducing the trade deficit. The current account deficit is directly linked to the growth of foreign ownership of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets because it shows how much we have borrowed from abroad to finance our trade deficit. At the end of 1987, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s net debtor position stood at $ 368.2 billion. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gault </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told the committee that he estimates <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s foreign debt burden will top $ 500 billion this year and will approach $ 2 trillion by the year 1995. Economists have warned that as more and more money is transferred into foreign hands to service <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s debt, it will mean a lower standard of living for Americans. `` Our foreign debt is growing at the rate of approximately $ 200,000 per minute,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md. and chairman of the economic committee. `` Our status as a debtor nation has profound implications for the domestic economy. It affects employment prospects, the financial markets, the value of the dollar and vital sectors of the economy, such as housing, which depend on long-term credit.'' The administration, however, has played down the significance of the record increase in foreign investment in this country, contending the debt servicing is still a tiny fraction of the country's overall gross national product. The government will release Wednesday a report on the merchandise trade deficit for July with many economists predicting that the imbalance will decline slightly to $ 11.5 billion, down $ 1 billion from the June deficit.

 The government reported on Tuesday a sharp improvement in the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade from April through June, while stocks got a boost from predictions that the trade deficit would continue to decline. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the deficit in the current account shrank to $ 33.3 billion in the second quarter, a 9.8 percent improvement from a first quarter imbalance of $ 36.9 billion. It was the biggest quarterly improvement since a 20.1 percent drop in the final three months of last year. The current account covers not only trade in merchandise but also trade in services, which primarily reflect the flow of investment earnings between countries. On Wednesday, the government will report the merchandise trade balance for July, a monthly figure watched closely by the financial markets. The Dow Jones industrial average spurted ahead in late trading Tuesday, encouraged by remarks from <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary designate <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who said at his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing that he expects the trade deficit to decline at a surprisingly fast pace over the next few years. The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks ended 10.67 points higher at 2,083.04 after a mostly lackluster session. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, an investment banker who investigated the causes of last year's stock market crash, was nominated by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to replace former <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. In other markets, the dollar strengthened slightly, but activity was slow in advance of the July trade figures. Bond prices gained as the yield on the government's 30-year issue slipped below 9 percent. Oil prices advanced, driven by a rise in wholesale gasoline prices, which soared on news that refineries and oil platforms were threatened by a hurricane approaching the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The contract for October delivery of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, rose 7 cents to settle at $ 14.56 a 42-gallon barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery closed up 1.19 cents at 43.81 cents a gallon. The government's trade report showed the second-quarter improvement in the current account deficit occurred because the deficit in merchandise trade fell to $ 29.9 billion, down from $ 35.2 billion in the first quarter, as exports rose to a record level and imports posted the first quarterly decline in three years.

 A federal judge on Tuesday accepted most of an $ 8.75 million jury award to a <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> woman in her suit against <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, manufacturer of the Copper-7 intrauterine device that she said left her sterile. Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>, however, lowered the emotional distress award given <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> from $ 1 million to $ 400,000, based on state law limiting recovery for intangible losses, including emotional distress, to $ 400,000. <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> said the damage awards for pain and suffering and punitive damages would remain. The jury of five women and three men returned the verdict last Friday after 10 days of deliberations that began after a 14-week trial. They awarded Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>, 30, of <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> $ 7 million in punitive damages, $ 1 million for emotional distress and $ 750,000 for pain and disability. The jury found the birth control device was not properly tested and that Illinois-based <PERSON> Searle </PERSON>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, failed to warn about risks and intentionally misrepresented the Copper-7. But the jury also found that <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> was not negligent in the design or manufacture of the Copper-7. <PERSON> Renner </PERSON> could have declared that the jury's decision was improper and declare a mistrial. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Searle </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION><LOCATION> , </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said company attorneys were preparing briefs to be submitted Oct. 4 on a motion to dismiss the verdict and request a new trial. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said oral arguments would be presented after attorneys had a chance to review the briefs. `` The appeal will take place after the post-trial activities, and we do anticipate being successful on appeal,'' <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Brosnahan </PERSON>, one of Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON>'s attorneys, said last Friday the case marked the first time a jury had awarded punitive damages against <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> for a Copper-7-related illness and also was the largest award. About 500 suits have been filed over the Copper-7, the most widely used IUD in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before it was withdrawn from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in January 1986 in the midst of litigation. Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> had sought $ 15 million in punitive damages, $ 1.5 million to $ 2 million in compensatory damages and $ 300,000 in compensatory damages for her husband, <PERSON> William </PERSON>. The jury declined to award <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> any money for loss of consortium as a direct result of his wife's use of the Copper-7. Some 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, once the most widely used IUD in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before it was withdrawn from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market in January 1986. <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> won 14 of the previous 17 cases to be decided, but <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> lawyers have said that none of the previous cases included as many documents or deposition testimony as this one. Mrs. <PERSON> Kociemba </PERSON> used a Copper-7 for just under 1 -LCB- years in 1977 and 1978. She claimed the IUD triggered a pelvic infection two weeks after insertion and that the infection scarred her fallopian tubes, leaving her sterile.

 <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> plans to seek an increase in its <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production quota, Energy Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamariz </PERSON> said Tuesday, noting that government budget plans did not account for the recent decline in world oil prices. <PERSON> Tamariz </PERSON> said the average price <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> gets for its oil has been ranging between $ 11.88 and $ ll .55 a barrel, while the government's budget was calculated on an estimate of $ 17 a `` There is a certain weakness in the petroleum market that has accentuated in recent days, with a declining tendency,'' <PERSON> Tamariz </PERSON> said in a news conference. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is one of the smallest producers among the 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION>, although oil provides more than half of its export earnings. The energy minister said <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> planned to ask <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to increase its production quota from 210,000 barrels daily to between 300,000 and 310,000 barrels. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> currently produces 310,000 barrels a day with special permission from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, which ends this month. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> approved the temporary increase in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s production after the country suffered devastating economic damage from earthquakes in March 1987. <PERSON> Tamariz </PERSON> said the market was unstable because of peace negotiations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which are among the world's major oil producers Overall OPEC production in August was estimated at 20 million barrels a day, nearly 3.5 million barrels over its self-imposed output ceiling. The world oil glut, plus speculation that the cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war could bring even higher production, has helped depress prices below <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark of $ 18 a barrel. In addition to <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> is seeking a higher quota. The U.A.E. has refused to accept a quota of 948,000 barrels a day and demanded a 1.5 million-barrel quota, roughly the level of its current production.

 A defendant utility in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> fraud trial settled its share of the case for $ 6.5 million in an agreement announced late Tuesday, the day before opening arguments were set to begin in federal court. The settlement by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Clallam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> left 19 other defendants, including 16 utilities, to stand trial in the fraud suit stemming from the biggest municipal bond default ever. Settlements so far total more than $ 353 million and have included more than 70 utilities and Wall Street firms that handled <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bond sales. Plaintiffs also have assumed rights to disputed insurance claims that could yield another $ 92 million. Opening trial statements were expected to last through Thursday. The first witness is expected to take the stand Monday. Bondholders originally sued more than 100 parties in the case, which grew out of <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>' 1983 default on $ 2.25 billion worth of bonds sold to finance construction on two never-finished nuclear power plants, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> Nos. 4 and 5. The defendants have denied the claims of fraud, arguing that poor judgment may have been a factor but <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> and defendant utilities acted in what they believed were the best interests of the Northwest's energy needs. In addition to the 16 utilities, which were both <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> board members and participants in building plants 4 and 5, remaining defendants include two engineering firms and a financial adviser to the supply system. <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, an attorney for plaintiff <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> bond buyers, said <LOCATION> Clallam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> PUD </LOCATION> would pay $ 6 million cash, and another $ 521,750 would come from its insuror. <LOCATION> Clallam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> PUD </LOCATION> commissioners still must formally approve the settlement, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. Officials of the <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, Wash.-based utility were not immediately available for comment. `` This is a significant settlement in that it's a first with a member that's -LRB- basically -RRB- uninsured,'' said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>. `` It shows the utilities can raise significant amounts of money without insurance,'' he said. The Clallam PUD settlement also could indicate what the entire <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> suit might be settled for. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Clallam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PUD </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 4.75 million per percentage point of its 1.4 percent interest in two <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> nuclear plants. The 16 remaining utilities contracted for about 63 percent of the plants' expected output, so a final settlement could total about $ 300 million. Settlement talks have been conducted in secrecy, so it is unknown which defendants are negotiating
