 Forty youths wielding iron pipes and clubs hurled firebombs on Thursday at a housing complex for families of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said. Two servicemen were wounded. The assailants, believed to be radical students, escaped after damaging or destroying nine military vehicles and passenger cars, the officials said. Attackers yelled `` Yankee go home!'' during the evening assault about one mile from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 8th Army headquarters near central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, authorities said. Ten firebombs exploded and caused at least $ 15,000 in damage, said a military spokesman. Gen. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Menetrey </PERSON>, who commands <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, issued a statement Friday calling the attackers `` cowardly criminals.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said security was increased at the housing complex. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the youths attacked the back gate of the <LOCATION> Hannam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> complex, which houses about 2,500 military dependents. At least 15 youths got inside, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The spokesman said the back gate is used for road traffic and was open, with two guards on duty. He said additional help was called, but the attackers fled. An Army news release said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military policeman was hurt when the youths hit him with iron pipes. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer was injured when a pipe was thrown through the windshield of his car. The soldiers' identities were withheld. <LOCATION> Hannam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> is leased from the <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for use by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military dependents. It faces <ORGANIZATION> Dankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Radical students attacked the housing area front gate twice in October with no reports of injury. In central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> on Thursday, riot police battled thousands of farmers chanting `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' and trying to march on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to protest American farm imports. About 2,000 riot police blocked an estimated 7,000 farmers and other protesters. Hundreds of protesters hurled rocks and bricks at police and attacked troopers with clubs after the march was blocked a few hundred yards from the embassy. Students joined the march and threw a few firebombs at police. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressuring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to open its markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> imports, especially agricultural products, to help ease <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s $ 10 billion annual trade deficit with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused late Thursday to lift a stay of execution for man who killed an inmate in a dispute over a diamond ring, marking the second time the man's execution has been blocked against his wishes In a ruling handed down shortly after 9 p.m. CST, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied the state's motion to vacate a stay that had been issued to <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> earlier Thursday by the 8th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. In a 7-3 ruling handed down about 5 p.m. in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the court said it needed more time to review <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s case, including the issue of whether he is competent to abandon his appeals. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had been scheduled to die at 12:01 a.m. Friday. The execution would have been the first in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> since 1965, the first under the state's 11-year-old reinstated capital punishment law and the first use of lethal injection, a change from the former gas chamber. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 30, has said he wants to die now rather than spend years on death row awaiting `` the inevitable.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, filed a petition with the court earlier Thursday, seeking to stop the execution, contending <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is not competent to abandon his appeals. The <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defenders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a stay. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was sentenced to die for the 1985 stabbing death of inmate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. He also had been scheduled to die Oct. 4 for the 1980 beating death of <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, a former girlfriend, but the 8th Circuit stayed that execution, saying it needed more time to determine if <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was competent to abandon his appeals. Authorities said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was killed in a dispute over a diamond ring, although <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he committed the murder so he could be executed. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has said he killed Ms. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> because she gave him a venereal disease and caused him to lose his fiancee. Last month, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> stood by her husband in his decision to abandon his appeals, but recently decided to challenge his competency and try to get the latest execution halted. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a registered nurse from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, got to know <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> through letters and married him last year in the prison. `` <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is a very sick and emotionally disturbed young man who is not competent to decide whether to abandon his appeals and acquiesce in his execution,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s motion for a stay. The state's response contended <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s competency has already been established and criticized Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> for her `` eleventh hour'' request for a stay. In a telephone interview from the prison Wednesday, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said his wife had joined forces with those trying to save him because she had been `` brainwashed.'' `` Apparently they told her it would come off and she is their only chance to stop it,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` They told her that with her there is a 90 percent chance of stopping it.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> has vowed to start a hunger strike and threatened to commit violence against others if his execution is halted by the courts.

<TEXT>
 Major central banks came to the dollar's rescue Thursday in a united buying spree that stabilized the weakening currency. But analysts warned the recovery might be short-lived because of continued concerns about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade and budget deficits. The coordinated worldwide buying of dollars by central banks appeared to be the heaviest since the spring, and it lent some support to the slumping stock market, which has been keeping a keen eye on dollar activity. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks closed up 13.87 points at 2,052.45. But the rebound still left the market's best known measure down about 75 points over seven sessions. Bond prices slipped, pushing interest rates higher. The yield on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s bellwether 30-year bond rose to 9.15 percent from 9.11 percent, although some analysts blamed the decline on the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s auction of long-term bonds Thursday rather than the action in the currency markets. Investors in the financial markets worry that a weak dollar could drive up interest rates and spark higher inflation, since it would raise prices of imports and some domestic commodities. Currency traders said the central-bank intervention began without much success in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, as heavy buying of the dollar by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> did not keep the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency from dropping to a near 40-year low of 121.5 yen. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> began selling yen for dollars in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> also bought up dollars to reduce the supply of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency on the market, traders said. The central banks of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and other nations then joined in. The dollar rebounded to about 122.6 yen in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> before slipping to 122.2 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The dollar gained ground against all other major currencies. On Friday morning in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the dollar opened at 122.15 yen, and by midmorning was trading at about 122.23 yen.

<TEXT>
 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said Thursday the recent <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> policy statement offers `` signs of hope'' that should be explored through a revived <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace effort. At a news conference, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said acceptance by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> parliament in exile of two key <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> represents a `` modest step forward'' on which progress toward peace could be made. And in a separate interview with reporters and editors of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, the prime minister declared that the policies of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> have ended the Cold War between the East and the West. At a news conference shortly before ending her two-day visit here, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> offered a slightly more upbeat appraisal of the declaration by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> than the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday `` more movement on key issues'' will be required by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regards it as ready to participate in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process. But Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said the indications of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flexibility should be encouraged, otherwise `` you wo n't get further moves.'' She called for a `` strenuous effort,'' including heavy pressure on both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arabs </LOCATION>, to get peace negotiations started. On the specifics of the declaration, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> indicated that she shares the administration's views. While offering restrained praise for the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> stand on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she opposes the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> proclamation establishing an independent state and added the declaration did not go far enough in repudiating terrorism. `` Obviously there are a lot of things in it that none of us like,'' she said. The two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions call for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from occupied territories and asserts the right of all countries in the area to live within secure borders. The administration has said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declaration on the resolutions was `` an advance'' compared with previous statements. But it said the council declaration as a whole falls short of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> requirements for opening a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. During the hour-long interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, `` We're not in a Cold War now'' but in a `` new relationship much wider than the Cold War ever was,'' according to a story in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>'s Friday editions. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies have affected East-West relations profoundly, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, adding that the previous `` minimal relationship'' with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that focused on arms control has expanded to include trade, culture and other major issues. `` I expect Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to do everything he can to continue his reforms,'' she said. `` We will support it.'' At the news conference, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> reaffirmed her high regard for President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, citing his extensive experience in government as a major asset. `` You will have a president who does n't have to be briefed,'' she said. She said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has carried out his many missions to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as vice president `` superbly,'' including his effort to ensure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intermediate-range missiles were installed in allied countries on time in 1983. Before a breakfast meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said she had `` not the slightest shadow of a doubt'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deal responsibly with the budget deficit. She offered similar expressions of confidence in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy in network television interviews she had at her temporary residence in the <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, across the street from the White House.

<TEXT>
 A prosecutor told jurors Wednesday that reputed mob boss <PERSON> Nicodemo </PERSON> `` Little Nicky'' <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and 16 associates should be convicted of racketeering based on their own recorded words. Defense lawyers, in their final arguments, said the government relied on liars and hearsay to form its case. `` According to the defendants, all the witnesses lied. And the defendants tell you that the Mafia is a figment of the imagination of -LRB- informants -RRB- <PERSON> DelGiorna </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Caramandi </LOCATION>,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` Now that is not true. There is a mob. The evidence has proven it.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>'s statements came after the jury heard from the last of the defense lawyers, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>. The 59-year-old <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON>, who authorities say heads the Mafia in the Philadelphia-southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> area, and his 16 associates are standing trial on federal racketeering charges, which include allegations of nine murders, extortion and loan sharking. The jurors, sequestered since the two-month trial began, are scheduled to receive instructions from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> VanAntwerpen </PERSON> Thursday morning before beginning deliberations. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> suggested the government was trying to prove his client guilty through newspaper stories identifying <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> as a mob boss, not by evidence. `` That's how they want to prove the Mafia exists and that's how they want to prove his guilt,'' <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON>, like the other defense lawyers, hammered hard at the two star government witnesses, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON>. Both accepted government plea bargains and are under government protection. `` Is it possible for you to remove from your notes or remove from your minds the testimony of <LOCATION> Caramandi </LOCATION> and <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> and other government witnesses?'' <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> asked. `` If you do, you will find that the government case will collapse like a house of cards.'' But <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> noted that, besides the testimony, the government presented 15 to 20 hours of secretly recorded conversations. `` You heard <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> on the tape, and what he was talking about with others,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. `` They were talking about the Mafia. Their words. `` It is on the basis of those words that the government wants you to find these defendants guilty, not on newspaper articles.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> acknowledged that a good deal of the evidence came from the two informants. `` The defense would like you to believe that <PERSON> DelGiorno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> told you lies, and that there is no case, but that is not true, `` <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> acknowledged that the two witnesses were criminals, but said they were government witnesses `` because that's how you prosecute mob members.'' `` -LRB- Law-abiding citizens -RRB- do n't associate with the kind of people the evidence shows these defendants are. The only people who can tell you about the mob and how it works are people inside the mob. `` People like <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> and DelGiorno are not found among honest citizens. They are found in the sewers of the underworld.'' On the basis of testimony from <ORGANIZATION> DelGiorno </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Caramandi </PERSON> a year ago, <PERSON> Scarfo </PERSON> and former City Councilman <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Beloff </PERSON> were convicted of trying to extort $ 1 million from a developer.

 <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett-Winder </PERSON> has organized his own funeral to avoid bothering anyone with a mortician's bill. The 72-year-old retired businessman is ready to meet his maker for a bargain price of less than $ 180.

Corbett-Winder keeps dirty laundry in the coffin under his bed at his home in <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION>, southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, until it is needed. `` All they will have to do is roll me out of my bed and straight into the box,'' he said. He has also written his epitaph: `` <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbett-Winder </PERSON>, 1916 - No Rip Off.'' `` I'm deadly serious. Funerals can cost more than 1,000 pounds -LRB- $ 1,800 -RRB- and I'm not leaving any cash to the funeral directors,'' he said. `` Once I've slipped a few quid -LRB- pounds -RRB- to my mates to carry the coffin and paid the cremation fee it will be very cheap.'' He has already had a trial run for his cremation. `` It was beautiful, but a bit hard on the backside. I'll have to put in a cushion and pillow,'' he said. Corbett-Winder, a grandfather, said he will leave all his money to the <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospice </LOCATION>, where he works as a volunteer.

 Eight pilots in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> were indicted Wednesday for allegedly failing to disclose drug and alcohol-related convictions when they applied for medical certification from the federal government, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said.

The maximum penalties faced by the pilots if convicted are five years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. The statement did not indicate whether the pilots worked for commercial air lines. <ORGANIZATION> Burnley </ORGANIZATION> said there are likely to be more indictments as part of a special national effort by the departments of transportation and justice to achieve a drug-free transportation system. `` Our inspector general is pursuing similar investigations in all 50 states, and further criminal charges are expected,'' said <LOCATION> Burnley </LOCATION>. Twenty-seven airline pilots, flight instructors and private pilots were indicted on Sept. 30 in the first such actions by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` These indictments reflect the serious problem of drug and alcohol abuse that affects all parts of our society. ...

Southern Baptists from <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> have been meeting most of this week to elect new officers and define bylaws tht govern the Southern Baptist Convention. Always present during the proceedings is a power struggle between moderate Baptists, who believe the Bible is authoritative but open to scholarly interpretation, and fundamentalists, who take a literal interpretation of the Bible and have controlled the 14.7 million-member denomination for the past decade. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> voted to cut back the denomination's donation to national and international causes. Some 2,200 Baptists, gathered at 127th annual <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Baptist Convention in <LOCATION> Lakeland </LOCATION>, Tuesday approved giving to charity 47.65 percent, or $ 10.3 million of their $ 21.6 million budget next year, down from 50 percent. The Rev. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, chairman of the budget-allocations committee, said budget requests are up $ 500,000 from last year, most of it due to debt payments, salary adjustments, program increases and such expenses as insurance. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Baptists elected as their president the Rev. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Billingsley </PERSON>, a 54-year-old pastor from <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a layman from <LOCATION> Niceville </LOCATION>, was elected first vice president. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, Baptists closed their three-day convention with a vote that reaffirmed Baptists' right to interpret the Bible as they see it. During Wednesday's final session, a resolution that says pastors can encourage members to `` exercise the traditional privileges and rights of believers as priests'' passed on a 791-629 vote. The moderate-backed resolution challenged a measure passed by the national convention that gave pastors more authority for running their churches and interpreting scriptures for their congregations. Convention delegates also voted on six resolutions that could affect policies at more than 3,000 affiliated churches. Among the resolutions were official statements opposing pornography, abortion and legalized gambling. The gambling resolution warned Baptists that the state legislature will soon consider establishing a lottery. The <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> ended Wednesday with a new president being selected by acclamation for the first time in decades. The Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, a conservative <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> pastor, was the only candidate nominated to succeed layman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Tondera </PERSON>, who served the customary two years as convention president. `` I would describe my posture as bridge building or centrist,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` By concentrating on that on which we agree, we can continue to defuse that on which we disagree. I put that as a priority.'' <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> Baptists agreed Wednesday to open several group homes for retarded adults in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, approved a $ 25.8 million budget, selected <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> as the group's president and decided to support a three-year missions partnership with the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Baptist Convention on Wednesday denounced criticism leveled at slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> by a state denomination leader earlier this year. The convention adopted a resolution condemning remarks made by <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that praised South African apartheid and labeled King as a fraud. The convention's 1,961 delegates also voted unanimously to elect the Rev. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Futral </PERSON>, pastor of a Jackson church, to a second one-year term as president. In <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Baptists </ORGANIZATION> said they may reconsider their funding of convention ministries. About 2,500 messengers, or delegates, from congregations across the state approved moderate-backed statements saying they would do so unless the convention provides `` more direct communication, accountability and flexibility regarding matters of conscience.''

 Japanese wine lovers plunged into the first batch of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Beaujolais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nouveau </ORGANIZATION> early today, marking the start of what industry officials predict will be a record year in sales of the wine in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. A fleet of more than 400 trucks loaded to the brim with cases of new Beaujolais spread out across <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> to deliver the red burgundy to restaurants and distributors following its release by customs. Because the distribution embargo on the wine was lifted at midnight local time around the world, Tokyoites received their <ORGANIZATION> Beaujolais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nouveau </ORGANIZATION> eight hours ahead of Parisians. Corks popped and wine glasses brimmed over at one of the first Beaujolais Nouveau parties of the year at <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maestro </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shigeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, a well-known psychiatrist and one of some 30 guests at the restaurant, led the toast by announcing: `` The Beaujolais Nouveau of 1988 has arrived ... Bravo.'' The 72-year-old <PERSON> Saito </PERSON>, who says he indulges in all types of alcoholic beverages, said he came to the early-morning gathering `` just out of curiosity.'' Participants, who paid $ 40 a head, all said they were pleased with the newest batch of wine, released every fall following the grape harvest. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, lawyer and organizer of the wine-tasting, said <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON> <PERSON> Nouveau </PERSON>, a newly fermented wine, appeals to Japanese wine drinkers because it contains less tannin than wine fermented for longer periods of time. `` And traditionally, Japanese have fun drinking and consuming the fresh food items of each season,'' he added. Industry officials are already predicting a record year in sales for the wine, which is produced in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s Beaujolais region. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Suntory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese distiller and leading importer of Beaujolais, said overall imports of the new wine will total 153,000 cases in 1988, an increase of over 70 percent compared to last year. Suntory alone will import 23,000 cases of the 1988 Beaujolais Nouveau wine, up from 12,000 cases last year, to meet the growing thirst of Japanese wine drinkers, said <PERSON> Kiyoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Suntory </ORGANIZATION>. Japanese consumers, who already pay the world's highest food and beverage prices, will be expected to put up with hefty price tags on the new Beaujolais. <ORGANIZATION> Suntory </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON> estimated that airfreighted <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON> will be sell in the range of $ 14 to $ 30 a bottle, while wine arriving one month later by ship will for $ 6.50 to $ 15.

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> pronounced the space shuttle Atlantis `` ready to fly'' and set Dec. 1 as its launch date, but the space agency is n't divulging the liftoff time or length of the secret <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> mission. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s associate administrator for space flight, made the announcement Wednesday following a two-day flight readiness review of the mission, which will carry five military astronauts and a spy satellite. The launch will be the second for the shuttle program since the Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts in January 1986. Following a 32-month period of major modifications, the program resumed Sept. 29 with the successful launch of Discovery and a five-man crew. `` I am pleased to report that the space shuttle Atlantis is as ready to fly as Discovery was at this same point before its flight last September,'' Truly said. The publicity that heralded Discovery's flight will be missing for Atlantis, with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the Pentagon cloaking most information in secrecy because of the military payload. The exact launch time and length of the mission will not be disclosed in advance, and once <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> is in orbit, there will be a news blackout until the landing. Defense officials said the secrecy would make it more difficult for Soviet ground and space systems to monitor the launch and the deployment of the payload. Sources said they expect a liftoff about 7 a.m. EST and report the astronauts will deploy an intelligence-gathering satellite whose assignments include helping American intelligence officials verify that the Soviets are complying with arms control treaties. The sources also reported the five crew members will conduct several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military observer in space. The all-military crew is commanded by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>. The pilot is Air Force Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> and the mission specialists are <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt.

 The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday overrode intense opposition by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and enacted a law requiring prospective handgun owners to wait 15 days before picking up their weapons.

<HEAD>Arms Could Have Been Used Against Republic, King Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities arrested 10 people and seized a rocket-powered grenade launcher, rifles, warheads and other weapons believed to belong to Protestant loyalist guerrillas. Northern Ireland Secretary <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said the huge arms cache found in British-ruled <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> on Wednesday could have been used against targets in the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said it arrested 10 people after seizing the arms in a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> public housing project 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. It said the weapons included a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and five warheads, rifles, hand grenades, more than 12,000 rounds of ammunition and inoperative scrap parts for a missile launcher. `` Here we have an apprehension by the police of what appear to be loyalist weapons which, no doubt, could have been used against targets in the republic,'' King told reporters at Stormont Castle, the seat of government in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. `` I think it clearly indicates the importance and the effect of increased cooperation on security,'' he said. Loyalist is the term used for the province's <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority, who want to remain under the British flag as part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and not merge with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> police said earlier that so far this year they recovered from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla groups 438 guns, 90,000 rounds of ammunition, 9,600 pounds of explosives, 111 rockets and mortars and 200 pounds of plastic explosive. Another 8,300 pounds of explosive was recovered from defused bombs. The mainly Catholic and outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite it with the republic.

<HEAD>Exotic Vegetables Catching On In American Supermarkets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bok </PERSON> choy and escarole are n't crops for every farmer, but an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economist says such exotic food items are catching the eye of supermarket shoppers. Increasingly, produce counters are also including fruits that are a bit off the trodden path of consumers: pomegranates, guava, kumquats, and melons named <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clause </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Casaba </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crenshaw </PERSON>. `` Specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part of the new up-scale image of many produce sections,'' said <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general increase in fruit and vegetable consumption, she said. The average American consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year, up 12 percent since 1972. That is a farm weight equivalent before trimming, processing and after-harvest losses, she said Wednesday. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said the per capita trend is expected to continue upward, although there could be some year-to-year variations. For example, she said, this year's drought probably will cause some decline from the 1987 average. In any case, specialty fruits and vegetables are the rage among many consumers, and there is no sign the demand will taper off soon. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, writing in the agency's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>, said there are a number of reasons. `` Americans have become more health conscious, eating lots of fruits and vegetables as part of a well-balanced diet,'' she said. `` Consequently, we want a huge selection of produce.'' Further, Americans travel more frequently than they used to, and many want `` foreign'' foods when they return home. `` Unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant menus,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said. `` Also influencing our diets are recent immigrants from the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> who have brought their native foods with them.'' A recent survey by the industry's <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> showed that the number of items sold in supermarket produce departments more than doubled to 150 between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s. Today, more than 250 items is the norm, including new packs and sizes of traditional fruits and vegetables, along with exotic and specialty produce. Another survey conducted for a trade journal, The <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, showed the most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa and bean sprouts, followed by snow peas, pearl onions, parsnips, leeks, baby vegetables, Chinese cabbage and shallots. Moreover, about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard of less widely known specialty vegetables such as Belgian endive, bok choy, celeriac, daikon, kohlrabi, parsley root and <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> artichoke. The most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits, in order, were pomegranates, persimmons, kumquats, quince and guavas. Additionally, at least a third of those surveyed had seen or heard of breadfuit, passion fruit, plantains, prickly pear and red bananas. But some fruits were nearly unkown: Asian pears, carambolas, cherimoyas, sapotes, radiccho and rappini. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said the survey showed that consumers in the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are more likely to try specialty produce and fresh herbs, another group of growth items. One factor is the West's large Asian and Hispanic populations, with their interests in exotic produce. Also, it was shown that consumers in the upper income brackets eat more of the speciality fruits and vegetables. `` They may be better informed about the variety of produce available and better able to afford the premium prices that specialities sometimes command,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports jumped 26 percent to a four-year high of $ 35.2 billion in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30. Actual quantities of grain and other commodities totaled 147.5 million metric tons, up 14 percent from 129.2 million tons shipped in 1986-87 when the value was $ 27.9 billion. The new figures released Wednesday were up from the previous forecast issued on Aug. 25, when the value was projected at $ 34 billion and the volume at 146 million tons. Despite the sharp gains, the year's totals were still far below the record levels of $ 43.8 billion and 162.3 million tons in 1980-81 before world economic conditions, high interest rates, foreign competition and other economic factors triggered annual declines. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> credited the 1985 farm law's lower price support mechanisms with making <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities more competitive in world trade <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said a decline in food prices last month `` proves that export increases did not occur at the expense of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumers, despite this summer's damaging drought.'' The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> says higher commodity prices point to another increase in the value of exports in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. But it says the actual volume may decline. A forecast of 1989 farm exports is scheduled for release on Nov. 29. Wheat accounted for two-thirds of the volume increase last fiscal year, and `` significant increases'' were reported for corn, livestock feed and fodder, and vegetable oils. Overall, exports of grains and feeds accounted for more than $ 12.7 billion of the total, up 37 percent. Other categories included: oilseeds and products, $ 7.7 billion, up 19 percent; livestock products, $ 4.9 billion, up 24 percent; horticultural products, $ 3.8 billion, up 21 percent; cotton, $ 2.15 billion, up 50 percent; and tobacco, $ 1.3 billion, up 8 percent.

 This year's drought-reduced grain and soybean harvests will mean sharply higher feed costs for livestock producers in the coming year, with some items costing almost half again as much, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Drought and hot weather reduced total feed grain production by 34 percent this year to the smallest total since 1983. Prices of feed grains, mostly corn, are expected to average 25 percent to 45 percent above last year's weighted average of $ 76.70 per ton, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Soybean meal prices may average $ 235 to $ 275 per ton, compared with $ 222 in 1987-88.

<HEAD>Deportation Of At Least 12 Mariel Detainees Appears Imminent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 12 Mariel prisoners have apparently exhausted their administrative appeals and could be deported within days, but plans are in the works by prisoner advocates to block any deportations, a newspaper reported Thursday. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leshaw </PERSON>, director of the non-profit <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> legal aid organization representing Mariel detainees, said he was informed by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that there would be an announcement Thursday on the prisoners. Meanwhile, prisoner advocate groups in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> plan to ask federal judges to stop the deportations, which if carried out would mark the first time Cubans have been deported to their communist homeland since May 1985, The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` There is a chance if we all speak with one united voice here and explain the merits of our case,'' said <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON> is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees in <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and at an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> prison last November. `` We will appeal to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He can block the deportations, even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the airport.'' A special three-member <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> panel was created in the aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 Mariel detainees in federal prison in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala </LOCATION>. In the past two months, the panel has looked at prison records, immigration history, written statements from the prisoners and other materials, but there have been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers. Deportations to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> were reinstated as part of a renewed immigration pact between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> that allows up to 20,000 Cubans and 3,000 political prisoners and their families to emigrate and, in return, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government will take back 2,500 prisoners. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contends that these prisoners are criminals the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> regime injected into a boatlift of refugees from the port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>. Prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984 immigration pact. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> <PERSON> Canosa </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledges there is much division over the deporations, even in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s Cuban exile community. He said the foundation favors letting Cubans apply for visas to immigrate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but opposes the deportations to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. `` I can not in one hand denounce the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and then support sending them back,'' <PERSON> Mas </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have postponed initial indictments in the massive <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing fraud scandal while they debate whom to charge first. `` We expect action in the very near future but not this week and probably not next week,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dibbley </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> in suburban <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where the more than 2-year-old investigation is headquartered. Last month, <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> sources predicted that the first indictments would be brought by mid-November, but now the best estimates are that the grand jury will vote on charges either very late in November or in early December. A source at <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> headquarters said Wednesday, `` It's still being reviewed here, over legal issues.'' Another government source added, `` It was anticipated that something would happen tomorrow and it will not happen tomorrow.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> said Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, head of the criminal division, `` has never set a timetable. He's told them to take their time and go when the case is in shape.'' Prosecutors say they have evidence that consultants _ including some former high-level <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials and former high-ranking military men who work for the nation's largest defense contractors _ bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials for information vital to winning contracts worth billions of dollars. Two corporations and three individuals were identified this week by government and defense sources as among the potential targets of the first charges. These sources said consultants <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> had been offered plea bargains by prosecutors, but the pair had declined to plead guilty to the charges offered. Those charges included conspiracy and bribery, the sources said. The sources also said prosecutors were weighing charges against <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, both of which were searched in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> raids last June. The sources also suggested that charges were being contemplated against <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Berlin </PERSON>, a procurement specialist with the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and four other <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees have been transferred away from contract work. Other sources, however, had said earlier that no government employee would be among the first group charged. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> has said he paid <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> $ 15,000 to $ 18,000 in late 1986 for information on a pending <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract for equipment to distinguish hostile and friendly aircraft. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> said he then turned the information over to <LOCATION> Hazeltine </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> said he concluded the information came from <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> but that it was not secret. <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> also has said he split fees with <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> from <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newbury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, which was seeking an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> contract. But <PERSON> Parkin </PERSON> said they did not have to do any work in that case. <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON>, said his client `` never gave anybody a nickel.'' <PERSON> Berkley </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said, `` We were told this week by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that they have made no decision yet. We are not going to respond to unofficial statements from the government. When the government has an official statement, we will respond.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Orso </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Hazeltine </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We are not commenting on the investigation in any form.'' <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> could not be reached for comment. Some observers have questioned whether <LOCATION> Hazeltine </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Teledyne </ORGANIZATION> should be included in the same indictment because they did not compete for the same contracts even though they employed the same consultants. One Justice source said there were legal arguments on both sides of that question, and the arguments and theories were changing regularly in the complex case. `` These things tend to change almost daily as you sift the evidence,'' this source said. `` But we do n't want to end up with 30 trials.'' <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> has said charges could be brought over a period of up to a year. At the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, chief of the fraud section, said, `` The department is simply interested in ensuring that any actions taken are done diligently and aggressively but with care and to insure propriety.''

 <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> needed help and he got plenty of it from some big names in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>: <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>. They all were eager to help <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> in his campaign to unseat Republican Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Tauke </PERSON>. Their appearances were n't enough. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> got only 36 percent of the vote on Election Day. But for Sens. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, the effort was n't wasted. For them, a chance to campaign in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, to make a few friends in the state that holds the nation's first presidential caucuses every four years, is no waste of time. Other familiar Democratic faces who campaigned in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in 1988 were <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, the winner of the 1988 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> caucuses, and former Gov. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> bypassed <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> during the caucus campaign and later as well, but he was on the road elsewhere. With the exception of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, those are all leftover names from 1988. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> are considered likely contenders for the 1992 Democratic nomination. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the defeated 1988 Democratic nominee, was `` back at a job I love,'' being governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. At his appearances immediately after his defeat, supporters chanted ``'92,'92,'92,'' but <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> refused to discuss the possibility of another presidential campaign. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> became something of a folk figure as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate and presumably will receive a lot of early attention as a prospect for the top spot on the ticket in four years. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will be 71 years old in 1992. Another familiar name that comes up every four years is Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Twice he's been mentioned and twice he's declined to run Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> decided against running n 1988, but is certain to take another look. `` He does n't know what he'll be doing in four years,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Gauldin </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, a favorite of Southern conservatives, also considered a 1988 run and opted out. `` It's premature to be talking about personalities in'92, me or anybody else,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. `` It's much too early, premature and downright immature to be talking about 1992 politics,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, when it became clear on Election Night that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was going down to defeat. But while two-time presidential candidate <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> brushed off talk about 1992, he already has formed a political action committee, Keep Hope Alive, and declared his intention to be involved in municipal elections in 1989. He's certain to be involved in the high-profile battle for mayor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where incumbent <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> will face a strong challenge fueled in part by his bitter clash with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> during the 1988 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> presidential primary. <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> hopes the potential 1992 candidates are serious when they say it's premature to start the next presidential campaign. `` Our focus ought to be on 1990,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON>, who called that the key year for determining which party has the edge when congressional and legislative redistricting takes place after the 1990 Census. That process, occurring once every 10 years, is certain to shift more <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seats from the Rust Belt to the <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION> and force a redrawing of lines that could change the political makeup of scores of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> districts. Maybe <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> can keep Democrats focused on redistricting. But as he is well aware, the first poll assessing the potential 1992 field is almost certain to be taken before Christmas 1988.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role in next month's meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will be as vice president, and any discussions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s future dealings with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader will be `` fairly brief,'' a spokesman said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the president-elect, will be attending the talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> when the Soviet leader is in town to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` It should not be expected that the meeting is being designed as a summit or designed with a set of objectives in mind that would be the kinds of things that we would hope for in a future meeting,'' <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, a co-director of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team, said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Study Finds No Solution To Fix Discrepancies In Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Social Security benefits to people born before 1917 are higher than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended, but there's no practical way to fix the inequity, a study concludes. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should neither reduce benefits to those getting the unintended windfall nor raise them for everyone else, said the study released Wednesday by the non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would strongly hope that this issue can be put to rest'' as a result of the report, said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dilk </PERSON>, a former senior analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and one of four experts on the study panel. In a related development, lawmakers and lobbyists reacted angrily to a draft government proposal that would make it harder for the elderly, disabled and poor to appeal government decisions denying them welfare or Social Security benefits. The proposed rule, still under review, would require people to submit all evidence at least seven days in advance of a hearing before an administrative law judge. Current regulations permit new evidence to be introduced during or after the hearing. The benefits report focused on a category of Social Security recipients known as `` notch babies,'' _ those born between 1917 and 1921. It said their benefits in some cases are as much as $ 200 a month less than those of people born earlier. But the notch babies are receiving the level of benefits <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended and in fact are at an advantage compared to people born after them, the report concluded. The inequity, the report said, lies in the fact that those born before 1917 are getting higher benefits than <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended _ not that others are receiving too little. The notch, or discrepancy in benefits, arose when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adopted a new formula meant to keep rising Social Security benefits at a constant percentage of a person's average pre-retirement earnings. However, people born before 1917 were allowed to use the old, over-generous method of calculation. The result: a benefit rate that peaked in 1981 at 56 percent of average earnings, about 15 percentage points higher than what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had intended. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, chairman of the study panel and formerly executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, said there are probably about 1 million notch babies feeling `` substantial impact'' from the situation. He estimated it would cost up to $ 300 billion to equalize everyone's benefits _ and that would create new notches affecting those born in later years. He said it would be difficult and expensive to find the individuals who got windfalls, not to mention politically impossible to cut their benefits. `` We are not in favor of keeping a discrepancy in the law,'' said panel member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, former staff director to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s Social Security subcommittee. But he added: `` You find a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who wants to lower benefits. ... Good luck.'' Many on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, reacted angrily Wednesday to the draft proposal making it more difficult for the elderly, disabled and poor to appeal government decisions to deny welfare or Social Security benefits. `` There they go again,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., 88, the oldest member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and its foremost champion of the elderly He challenged President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to kill the plan and said if it goes forward, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will `` stop this thing in its tracks.'' The draft rules on Social Security appeals were designed to reduce a staggering load of appeals hearings. Last year, the agency received 5.5 million claims and 250,000 requests for appeals hearings. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, said the Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> appeals processes must become more efficient. `` The solution they are suggesting -LRB- in the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- may not be workable or doable, and until it's reviewed, you do n't know that,'' he said. But critics were quick to attack the draft proposals. Several charged they would violate the spirit of the 1935 Social Security Act as well as a 1971 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling supporting an informal and liberal appeals process easily accessible to the elderly, poor and disabled who often do not have lawyers. <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Deets </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>, called the proposals `` misguided and unjustified.'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoagland </PERSON>, a spokesman for the private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, accused the administration of `` trying to stack the deck against disability appeal claimants.''

<HEAD>Surge For Leftist Mayors Indicates Displeasure With President's
Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE HANDLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Brazilians expressed frustration with President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s center-right government, economic chaos and corruption by giving massive support to leftists in muncipal elections around the nation. `` At least now the voters ca n't blame us for everything that goes wrong with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> do Sul state, a member of <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Early returns from Tuesday's balloting showed that the dominant party since 1964 was taking a beating from both the right and the left, but that leftists were surging ahead for control of major cities. Final results were not expected until Sunday. Analysts said voters were dissatisfied with a record 1,000 percent annual inflation rate, the falling value of the cruzado, political corruption and nearly constant strikes. `` The voters did n't send us just a message. A message is short. This was a telex,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Wellington </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreira </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> state, a member of <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s party. In the biggest upset, <PERSON> Luiza </PERSON> <PERSON> Erundina </PERSON>, a 53-year-old social worker and a Marxist from the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to win as mayor of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION>, the country's largest city. With 15 percent of the city's more than 5 million votes counted, Ms. <PERSON> Erundina </PERSON> led <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Maluf </PERSON>, a wealthy industrialist and former military-backed presidential candidate, by 4 percent. Ms. <PERSON> Erundina </PERSON> told reporters she would concentrate municipal funding on public health, transportation and abandoned children, areas in which `` hardly anything ever was invested before.'' In Rio, the No. 2 city, the winner was <PERSON> Marcello </PERSON> <PERSON> Alencar </PERSON>, a 63-year-old lawyer from the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He is a close ally of <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brizola </PERSON>, the expected candidate of the left in next year's presidential elections. With 28 percent of the ballots counted, <PERSON> Alencar </PERSON> had one-third more votes than his closest opponent. The projected winner in <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> <PERSON> Horizonte </PERSON>, the third-largest city, was <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Pimenta </PERSON> da <PERSON> Veiga </PERSON> <PERSON> Filho </PERSON>, 41, of the left-center <ORGANIZATION> Brazilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. This group recently broke away from <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s party The Democratic Movement, which swept mayoral elections in 1985 and captured 22 of 23 state governorships in 1986, appeared headed for mayoralty wins in just four capitals. Leftists seemed assured of victory in at least seven important state capitals. Candidates from various groups to the right of <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s were headed toward wins in seven other capitals. The biggest prize for the rightists was the large northeastern city of <LOCATION> Recife </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavalcanti </PERSON>, 40, of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was far ahead. He resigned this year from <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s Cabinet. Races in the remaining capitals were too close to call or the results were not yet in because of the cities' remoteness. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> have controlled Brazilian politics since the nation of 144 million returned in 1985 to civilian rule after a 21-year military dictatorship. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> is in the throes of its worst strike by petroleum workers. The state-owned oil monopoly <ORGANIZATION> Petrobras </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has nearly run out of diesel oil and cooking gas because of the six-day nationwide strike. Twenty-nine parties participated in the election for mayors and city councils of more than 4,000 cities and towns. The races were based largely on local issues, but analysts said they indicate general feelings about presidential elections scheduled for Nov. 15, 1989. It will be the first presidential election in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in 29 years. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> is a civilian, but he gained office indirectly through an electoral college system imposed by the departing military regime. He was the vice presidential candidate on a ticket headed by <PERSON> Tancredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Neves </PERSON>, a popular centrist political figure. <PERSON> Neves </PERSON> died before he could assume office, and <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> moved into the top spot.

 Problems among foreign coal producers and the lower dollar abroad contributed to a 247 percent increase in the amount of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coal shipped through the St. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaway </PERSON>, officials say. The increase, to 569,000 metric tons, was recorded during the period from April to October, as compared to the same period last year. Spurring the demand for American-mined coal were the lower value of the dollar; competitive worldwide ocean freight rates; a tight supply due to a series of industrial disputes last summer in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; sanctions against using South African coal; and production problems and rising production costs in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coal exports through the seaway in April-October of 1987 totaled 234,000 metric tons. In 1985 and 1986, the biggest coal years since 1982, coal exports just exceeded 600,000 tons each year. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seaway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> portion of the American-Canadian channel, said the majority of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export coal through the system so far this year has been transported to <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> for power production.

<HEAD>Nation's Median Age Heading Upward</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thirty-nine, that magic age teetering between youth and maturity, will be the most typical age for Americans early in the next century, according to <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> projections. Historically a nation of youthful orientation, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is now thirty-something, heading upward, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports. Combining to increase the median age of the population are the maturing of the massive post World War II Baby Boom and that generation's relatively low birth rates, which reduce the number of babies to pull down the numbers. So if present trends continue, census officials expect that half of all Americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010, and half younger. The agency's most recent estimate of median age was 31.7, as of 1986. Whether <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will plateau at 39 _ as did the late comedian <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> _ remains to be seen. The median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in 1950, then slipped back as the Baby Boom produced a bouncing crop of youngsters to lower the numbers. It took until the 1980 census to hit 30 again, edged up to 31.7 as of 1986 and is expected to climb to 33 by 1990, 36.5 by 2000 and 39 by the year 2010, according to the new projections from the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the aging of the population, however, the report anticipates that the so-called dependency ratio will decline. That ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 compared to the number of people of working age in between. The younger and older groups are most likely to `` depend'' on those working. The 1986 ratio of 62.2 dependents per 100 workers is expected to slip to 56.7 by the year 2010, with the low birth rate reducing the number of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds to the older group. While there have been reports of increases in the total number of births in the last few years, that is because the giant Baby Boom generation is largely in its prime childbearing years. The rate of births per 1,000 remains well below that of the post-World War II period. The new census study also estimates that the nation's black population will increase to 13.7 percent by 2010. Blacks made up 11.8 percent of the population in the 1980 census. Nearly one in five Southerners will be black in 2010, 19.7 percent of the population. That will be up from 18.7 percent in 1980. In the Northeast, blacks will increase from 10.1 percent to 13.2 percent. They will go from 9.1 percent to 11.9 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and from 5.3 percent to 6.3 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. The projections show the Northeast remaining the oldest section of the country, with the median age for that region increasing from 33.6 in 1986 to 40.3 in 2010. The South will be second in 2010 at a median age of 38.4, up from 31.4 in 1986. The Midwest will mature from 31.6 to 38.8 and the West will go from 31.0 to 37.4. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will remain the state with the highest median age and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> will still be the youngest state, according to the projections. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, with a median age of 36.0 in 1986, will age to 45.3. <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s median will rise from 25.5 to 27.6, leaving it the only state with a median age below 30 years, thanks largely to a continuing high birth rate. In the 1986 estimates no state had a median over 40 but several were under 30, including _ besides <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In 2010 not only <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will have topped 40. Other states with median ages above that milestone will include <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Conservatives Urge More US Covert Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A conservative group contends that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should make covert action a routine technique in the American spy arsenal. A study sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> says covert action _ unacknowledged financial, political or military action to influence events in foreign countries _ should be restored as a common tool of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy. `` American intelligence, as it is presently constituted, will not be up to the challenges of the'90s,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Godson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who edited the study. The report was released Wednesday at a news conference. The report says covert action tactics have been tainted in the eyes of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public by the Iran-Contra scandal. While covert actions have proliferated under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, they still are viewed by the public and many within the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> as stepchildren, the study concluded. It also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence analysts should do more to spot the vulnerabilities of foreign governments and leaders and point out opportunities for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leverage and influence. The report said `` there will be major opportunities for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to advance its interests in the 1990s through a broad array of -LRB- covert action -RRB- techniques.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> deGraffenreid </PERSON>, former intelligence director at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said covert action `` should be perceived as a useful, limited adjunct, and a normal one, to statecraft.''

<TEXT>
 A parade of witnesses before a deficit-reduction commission agreed the nation is spending too much and saving too little, but panel members said they were far from reaching a consensus on how to resolve the problem. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> members listened to almost eight hours of testimony Wednesday from a variety of experts, many of whom warned of dire consequences for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if quick action is not taken to cut the federal budget deficit. `` Simply put, we are spending too much, investing too little and saving virtually nothing,'' said former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>. `` This country is imperiled and it is going to take a whole lot of guts to face this fact and deal with it.'' Later, commission members said they were still watching for the first signal from President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on what his intentions are for using the panel, which was created to advise President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor on a deficit solution. Both Republican <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, who serve as co-chairmen of the panel, said they hoped the president-elect would soon name his two appointees to the commission so the panel could begin serious deliberations. The commission already has set aside its earlier hopes of having a deficit-cutting blueprint finished by Dec. 21. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> said he was not sure the panel would be able to meet a March 1 deadline and might have to delay the report even further. `` The key to the commission's role is going to be up to the president-elect,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, D-Pa., a member of the panel and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Who does he appoint, how credible are they, do they have his ear and what are his instructions to them.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said the financial markets might force <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hand, especially if markets continue falling because of investor concerns over whether the president-elect and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be able to come up with a credible budget solution. The stock market on Wednesday tumbled to a 2 -LCB- - month low in a broad-based decline that analysts said was linked to fresh declines in the value of the dollar The dollar's recent slide has led stock market investors to worry that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers might force up interest rates _ threatening a further slowdown in the economy _ to make the American currency more attractive to foreigners. Economists testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said the $ 700 billion in new foreign investment which has flowed into the country since 1982 means that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is more vulnerable to foreigners' economic decisions. `` The rest of the world may well give up on the dollar if it foresees four more years of towering twin -LRB- budget and trade -RRB- deficits,'' said <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergsten </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the panel that it should not listen to those who say that bduget deficits do n't matter since the economy has managed to survive for six years without an economic downturn in the midst of high deficits. `` The deficit already has begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength,'' he said. `` And the need to deal with it is becoming ever more urgent.'' <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivlin </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told the commission that it was facing no easy choices. `` The budget can not be cut in sufficient amounts to eliminate the deficit, except by reducing programs and benefits that some people feel they want and need _ or by raising revenues,'' she said. `` It is not possible to eliminate the deficit if defense, Social Security and taxes are all ruled out simultaneously.'' Comments of this kind were not often heard during the presidential campaign, when both candidates sidestepped questions concerning the deficit because they did not want to offer detailed solutions. But since winning the election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been forced to address the budget situation, pledging to work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> early on to come up with a solution. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not indicated any willingness to abandon his `` flexible freeze'' proposal by which overall spending increases, excluding Social Security and interest on the national debt, would be held to the rise of inflation each year.

<TEXT>
 Items seized in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s computer virus investigation include magnetic tapes from the computer account of a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate student implicated in the contamination of 6,000 computers nationwide. Documents released late Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the magnetic tapes were from the account of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 23, a <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> graduate student in computer science who has told friends he created the virus program. The program spread earlier this month throughout a number of university and military computer networks, disrupting their operation. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> has said that he did not intend for it to invade computer systems around the nation. According to the documents released Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gustave </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBianco </PERSON> in the northern district of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> issued two warrants on Nov. 10 for the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> searches. The searches were conducted that same afternoon, the documents indicate. The government had said earlier that it might try to obtain documents from the university before interviewing <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for information technologies, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, had said the university would cooperate fully with the investigation. No charges have been filed in the case. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents, investigators seized `` two magnetic tapes labeled ` files from <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> account including backups' and hard copy related thereto'' from <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Krafft </PERSON>, a research associate in computer science at <LOCATION> Cornell </LOCATION> Federal agents also obtained `` two yellow legal pads with calculus and assorted notes.'' An associate university counsel, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Santoro </PERSON>, had taken the legal pads from an office in <LOCATION> Upson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>, a campus building that contains computer science classrooms and offices. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a criminal investigation to determine whether statutes concerning wire fraud, malicious mischief or unlawful access to stored communications may have been broken with the introduction of the virus into military and university computer systems. A computer virus works by duplicating itself, spreading into other programs in the computer and infecting one computer after another as users share floppy disks or link up over telephone lines. Mild viruses may do nothing more than flash a provocative message on a user's screen; `` deadly'' forms can destroy data or cripple a computer. Some are `` time bombs'' designed to wreak havoc on a pre-programmed date. The virus that infected 6,000 university and military computers nationwide this month apparently did its damage by rapidly duplicating itself, thereby slowing computers' processing speed and taking up their memory space.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it found `` no evidence whatsoever'' to support an allegation that a former assistant attorney general had smoked marijuana. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, had told investigators he had witnessed his predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, smoking marijuana at a 1982 party in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. A 17-page document filed Wednesday in federal appeals court by Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said that `` whatever picture <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> has in his mind of three people -LRB- including <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and his wife -RRB- smoking marijuana together ... the overwhelming evidence is that it was not'' the case. An internal memo released at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on which <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s court filing was based said <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that he himself had used marijuana as recently as four years ago, though not while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The internal memo, written by criminal division chief <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, also outlines what it says was apparent conflict between <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and some other <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. The memo concluded there is `` a serious doubt'' as to whether <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and his wife even attended the 1982 party. It said `` there is no evidence whatsoever'' to support <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s story that he saw <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, his wife and another man `` smoking a joint together.'' Neither of the Welds even recalls attending the party and neither do a number of other people who know the Welds well, said the memo. The memo provides the basis on which <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> decided not to call on a three-member federal appeals court panel to appoint an independent counsel to investigate <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> for possibly making a false statement during a 1987 probe by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> in which he denied smoking marijuana. The court directed that <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s court filing be publicly released. The memo said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>, a deputy assistant attorney general in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, told investigators he had been asked to call <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> to `` dig up some dirt'' on <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. He said the request was made by then-Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> then reported to <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> that he had witnessed <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> smoking marijuana at the 1982 party. At the time, <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> was under consideration to succeed <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> post. The memo said <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> believed <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> was trying to scuttle his nomination, but that he bore no ill will toward <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> because holding a grudge was against his religion. In an interview Wednesday night, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> denied telling <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> to dig up dirt on <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. He called <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>'s comments `` complete and total fabrication'' and said they bear `` no semblance with reality.'' <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> called his relations with <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> `` excellent.''

 Everyone supposedly seeks a better mousetrap; Fortune magazine likes the idea of a better mouse. For the first time, the business magazine has named an animal to its annual list of the nation's hottest products. That fits well with an overall trend for this year's list to the small and technologically advanced. Fortune's report, contained in the Dec. 5 issue, names 12 top items: _ Genetic mouse Last April, <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> received the first patent for an artificially engineered higher form of life. The mouse, being sold to researchers at $ 50 apiece under the trademark OncoMouse, was created by injecting genes suspected of causing cancer into fertilized mouse eggs. The offspring carry the implanted gene. _ Video Walkman For $ 1,300, video junkies no longer have to leave their favorite tape at home. _ `` E.T.'' on video. Six years after the movie made its debut, <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> has brought out a videotape of `` E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial'' and already has received orders for more than 11 million copies at $ 24.95 each. _ <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ultralite </ORGANIZATION> laptop computer Small enough to fit into an interoffice envelope, <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>'s computer is powerful enough to run the Lotus 1-2-3 program and four times faster than <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s XT personal computers. It lists for $ 2,999. _ Rogaine The first prescription hair-growth medication approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s product sells for about $ 50 for a month's supply. The minoxidil preparation must be used constantly or its effects stop, and only about 39 percent of the men in clinical tests experienced even moderate hair growth. _ <PERSON> Ricoh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirai </PERSON> The $ 795 camera has a short, adjustable handgrip that allows the user to adjust exposure settings, the zoom lens and shutter release with one finger. _ No-Color mascara <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Factor </PERSON> brought this out in July, and the idea of not getting smudged circles under their eyes proved a hit with women. The cosmetic sold out within a week, and the <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary is estimated to have sold 5 million of the tubes for $ 12 million. _ Personal fax machines They took off this year, zooming to a 30 percent share of the $ 1.9 billion fax market, offering features once contained in office versions. _ Erasable optical disk The disks allow the electronic storage of data equivalent to 300,000 pages of type. Analysts predict sales will grow to $ 1 billion a year within a few years. _ Wilson Profile tennis racket The extra-thick racket is changing tennis much as the first oversize <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> racket did a dozen years ago. The frame of a conventional racket bends back when hit by a ball, recovering after the ball already is headed back toward the opponent. The $ 225 Profile rebounds along with the ball, giving a player's shot much more power. _ Debt swap By exchanging some of its bank debt for special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury-backed bonds, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> was able to reduce its $ 60 billion debt load by more than $ 1 billion. In the ground-breaking plan it undertook with <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> gave the banks the opportunity to swap existing loans at a discount for the special, new bonds, which carry a higher interest rate than the old debt. _ <ORGANIZATION> Ergon </ORGANIZATION> 2 chair The latest version of a body-conscious chair that first appeared in 1976, it features a knob that controls back angle and customizes the seat cushion to adjust for derrieres of all proportions. Its maker, <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, charges $ 350 to $ 600 per share.

 Environmentalists, public officials and scientists are urging states to take the initiative to reduce their emissions of carbon gases from fossil fuel use, not wait for international action on the global warming trend. `` It can be done on a state-by-state basis _ the individual counts,'' says <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. `` There are steps that should be taken by good government pursuing the public interest.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> says warnings by scientists about the so-called greenhouse effect requires `` state leadership to think globally and act locally. Turning the corner on greenhouse gases is too big to leave to the federal government.'' They and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Renew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, cited a variety of steps for cutting the use of oil, coal and natural gas, the main sources of the carbon gases that experts say are contributing to global warming. Among the state-level actions they recommended at a news conference Wednesday are encouraging greater use of mass transportation, planting trees to absorb carbon and using tax incentives and building codes to spur more efficient energy consumption. <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON> unveiled a study by <ORGANIZATION> Renew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, an environmental research and advocacy organization, showing that <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>'s state of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was the clearcut leader among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states in carbon gas production in 1986. Its 154.87 million metric tons amounted to about 12 percent of the 1.275 billion metric tons of carbons pumped into the atmosphere that year by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the world's largest producer of carbons and other greenhouse gases. Renew <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said this country is responsible for about 25 percent of the world's carbon emissions, coal and natural gas, meaning <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is the source of about 3 percent of global carbon loadings to the atmosphere. Carbons represent about half of the greenhouse gases that many scientists say are accumulating in the atmosphere, trapping the sun's heat and threatening the planet with rising ocean levels and major climate changes. In what was billed as the first state-by-state breakdown of carbon emissions, <LOCATION> Renew </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said that largely rural <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> was the nation's lowest contributor to carbon emissions, with 1.31 million metric tons in 1986. Renew <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> said it compiled its figures from fuel-use data collected by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and had its report reviewed by officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and private-sector researchers, including <PERSON> Woodwell </PERSON>. The overall findings were not startling. They showed a general correlation between a state's population and industrial activity and its production of carbon gases. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with a large concentration of oil refineries and chemical plants, was No. 1 in carbon emissions from oil and natural gas _ the cleanest burning fossil fuel _ and No. 3 in emissions from coal. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was second overall in 1986, producing 85.23 million metric tons of carbons. Three out of every four tons came from use of oil, reflecting the state's huge number of vehicles. Other heavy producers of carbon emissions were <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 67.21 million metric tons; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 65.57; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 55.04; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, 51.73; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, 49.57; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, 49.13; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, 47.12; and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 43.55. Renew <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> also calculated how many tons of carbon a state released in relation to its economy. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, a depressed area dominated by coal use and chemical plants, had the worst showing: 1,179 tons for each $ 1 million in gross state product. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> were the only states among the top 10 carbon producers and the bottom 10 in the ratio of tonnage to gross state product. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had the best economic-ratio showing, producing 137 tons for every $ 1 million of gross state product. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s tonnage was 160 per $ 1 million, compared to a national average of 306 tons for each $ 1 million.

 Iran-Contra prosecutors say <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> wants to scare the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> into dropping charges against him by seeking disclosure of `` some of our nation's most valuable secrets.'' Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is seeking a court order to bar North from revealing any classified information during his defense of charges he illegally conspired to divert U.S.-Iran arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> North </PERSON> showed his intention of trying to subvert the case `` by not presenting a good-faith listing of the classified documents that he reasonably deems necessary to defend against the indictment,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in court papers filed Wednesday. The list of 40,000 pages of secret documents North proposed as defense exhibits includes items that `` are simple efforts at graymail and have no conceivable bearing on the charges in the indictment,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. It includes documents `` which are far afield from any logical defense,'' including `` large swatches of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> cables concerning <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> that bear only the most tangential relation to the subject matter in the case,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said of the defense list filed under court seal. The independent counsel asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to issue an order under the Classified Information Procedures Act -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- barring North from disclosing any government secrets during his trial. `` Otherwise, <PERSON> North </PERSON> will have exposed this prosecution to precisely the type of outcome that the drafters of <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION> worked to avoid: a decision by the attorney general _ based purely on fear that the price, in terms of threat to national security, is too high _ that compels the court not to proceed with the criminal case,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. North's `` filing demonstrates once against his expectation that intransigence will encumber the processes of law, threaten some of our nation's most valuable secrets and provoke dismissal of the case,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. The attorney general _ not <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> _ has the final say about whether to drop the charges if disclosure of secrets would threaten national security. The so-called `` graymail statute'' enacted in 1980 by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> set up procedures to regulate the use of classified information in court proceedings. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> argued the law is `` a critical, time-tested shield of the government's necessary secrets and, at the same time, a device that prevents high officeholders from escaping criminal prosecution'' by threatening indiscriminate disclosure of secrets. But North `` from the outset of this litigation, has been determined to force a failure of <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION>'s procedures,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` The present notice is so grossly overblown that it invites dismissal for lack of good faith.'' Under <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION>,, the defense is required to submit a notice listing the classified documents it proposes to disclose at trial. The judge then convenes secret proceedings to determine if the documents are relevant to the case and if they can be presented in public form. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> described the notice as `` calculated to overwhelm the court's and the government's abilities to conduct proceedings'' under the law. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s first list _ filed Aug. 1 _ as `` wholly insufficient,'' later saying it `` blatantly lacked any attempt at particularization.'' The judge denied a similar request by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to bar defense disclosure of any secrets and gave <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> until Nov. 14 to file his notice. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the defense should be barred from using any classified documents because `` North arrogantly disregarded the court's repeated orders defining his obligations under <ORGANIZATION> CIPA </ORGANIZATION>.'' North's attorneys, who have a policy of not commenting on the case, did not return a reporter's telephone call. But in court papers made public Wednesday, the defense rejected <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s criticism of their Aug. 1 filings as unjustified. The lawyers disputed <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s holding that they were required to show how the documents were relevant to the case. North, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide and retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel, is charged with conspiring to defraud the government by illegally diverting to the Contras more than $ 12 million in profits from the arms-for-hostage sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. No date has been set for North's trial. His three co-defendants, former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, each have been granted separate trials.

<HEAD>`Fathers' of Soviet, American A-Bombs Disagree on Star Wars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unprecedented joint appearance by two men frequently described as the respective `` fathers'' of the Soviet and American hydrogen bombs featured sharp disagreement on whether space-based defenses would bring world harmony or nuclear war. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the Soviet scientist who has become his nation's foremost human rights activist, said deploying such a defense system would `` destabilize the world'' and could trigger nuclear war between the superpowers <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON>, one of the principal American advocates of deploying the Star Wars defense system, said it could lead to a `` world neighborhood'' of cooperation and peace. The two scientists aired their views Wednesday evening at a banquet honoring Teller as a pioneer in the field of nuclear physics and for his advocacy of the Strategic Defense Initiative, SDI. It was sponsored by the Ethics and <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative research group. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 67, winner of the Nobel and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON> peace prizes, attended the dinner as part of his first trip outside his native land. He and Teller held a private 20-minute conversation, the first time the two had met. In a speech at the beginning of the banquet, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> praised Teller as a man of principle and conviction but said deploying the Strategic Defense Initiative, as the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> plan is formally known, would be `` a great error.'' `` I feel it would destabilize the world,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. He cited the `` enormous cost'' involved in paying for the deployment of a defense system by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to field new offensive weapons to defeat it. `` If such systems are deployed ... there would be a temptation to destroy them'' before they were armed, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said. `` And this in itself could trigger a nuclear war.'' Short of actual war, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said, SDI is an obstacle to better relations between the two superpowers. `` SDI is one of the problems that stands in the way of achieving really deep and profound arms control,'' he said. Soviet objections to SDI have been a central obstacle to superpower negotiations in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on cutting long-range nuclear arms by up to 50 percent. Teller, responding at the banquet's end and after <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> had departed, called <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> `` a great man'' who shares with the world a desire for peace. `` <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> argued for the rights of individuals, argued for freedom in an incredibly courageous manner, and he won,'' Teller said of <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>'s long human rights battle against the Soviet system. But he said that as a physicist, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is out of touch with the technological advances of recent decades, including advances in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> which Teller said is closer to deploying a space-based defense system than is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` My argument has been that we must know what can be known, we must find out'' whether a defense system will work, he said, including `` lasers that move with the speed of light.'' `` I have enjoyed the possibility to work on all these things,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> has not.'' `` Technology has made out of the world a small neighborhood,'' he said. `` Self defense is of interest to everybody.'' Both men noted that their early careers in nuclear physics had followed parallel paths. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said that at the time he was working on the Soviet hydrogen bomb he and his colleagues believed that it was `` necessary for the peace of the world to do such terrible things.'' `` The world has now entered a new era and I am convinced a new approach is necessary,'' he said. While he and Teller disagree, <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said that through such dialogues their countries `` will at least understand each other's point of view and be able to talk instead of creating a situation of confrontation.

<HEAD>Study Finds Young Adults at Highest Risk of Weight Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans face the highest risk of weight gain during their 20s and 30s, when they put on an average of seven pounds a decade, a study shows. However, by age 55, people tend to stop putting on weight and begin losing it. Researchers said their study, based on a nationwide survey of almost 10,000 adults, is the first to calculate the risk of getting fat. `` Younger adults are at greatest risk of gaining substantial amounts of weight during adulthood,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>. `` A greater effort has to be applied to preventing obesity early in adulthood, possibly before age 25.'' The study found that men and women between ages 25 and 34 are likely to gain an average of seven pounds over the next 10 years. However, about 6 percent of the people in this age group will gain nearly 30 pounds in the next decade. The tendency to gain weight does not affect the sexes equally. An average American man puts on an extra six pounds between his 25th and 35th birthdays, but a woman gains almost eight pounds. The figures, analyzed by experts at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, were released Wednesday at the annual meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Among other findings: _ On average, people under age 55 tend to gain weight over time, while those over 55 tend to lose it _ Up to the age of 55, women gain more weight then men, while after 55 women lost more _ At all ages, women are twice as likely as men to have very large weight gains _ Among people who were not overweight when the study began, those aged 35 to 44 had the greatest risk of becoming overweight, while those 65 and above had the lowest risk <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said it is not clear from the results whether Americans' risk of gaining weight is actually increasing. `` As a nation, we are still too fat,'' he said. `` But I do n't know if we are getting fatter or leaner. The study was based on an initial survey of 14,407 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults between 1971 and 1975. Researchers contacted 9,897 of these people a decade later and weighed them again. Too much weight is clearly a health hazard. Other research shows that men may double their risk of heart disease if they are 30 percent above the weights recommended in the 1959 Metropolitan Life Insurance weight tables. This much excess weight for women increases risk by 22 percent. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> said weight gain is often so gradual that people fail to realize what's happening until they are already significantly overweight. He, like many diet experts, recommends keeping weight off rather than trying to lose it once the extra pounds have been gained. `` Walking 45 minutes a day, as well as reducing the amount of fat in the diet, are effective ways of keeping weight under control,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reckless Drivers, Bad Roads Push Traffic Deaths Toward U.S. Figure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN GILMOUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet drivers are so reckless and roads are so bad that the annual Soviet traffic death toll is almost as high as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has 10 times as many cars, the Communist Party daily said. About 40,000 people are killed in traffic accidents each year in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, Pravda said Wednesday. `` There is a lack of elementary ethics on the road, with drivers behaving rudely and without any respect towards each other,'' the paper. `` The Soviet road and high speed are not compatible.'' The 1986 traffic death toll in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was 47,900, according to the 1988 World Almanac. Pravda said in an article Oct. 30 that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has about 50 cars per 1,000 people, compared to 560 per 1,000 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Pedestrians account for about 13,000 of the annual Soviet traffic deaths, more than the combined total of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the paper said. It said 13 out of every 100 people injured in Soviet car accidents die, compared to 1.3 percent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Driving can be notoriously challenging in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, whose main roads are clogged with trucks that spew clouds of black smoke and often break down in the middle of the streets. Foreign visitors complain that Muscovites pay no attention to normal traffic guidelines, such as painted lane lines. `` You can expect to have your car kissed,'' said one British driver. He said Soviet drivers seem to consider it a point of honor to nearly sideswipe automobiles they pass. Soviet drivers rarely use the turn signal and seem to regard it as a tip-off to other drivers who may try to foil their maneuver. Pravda said rudeness was the motivation for drivers `` overtaking slower moving cars or simply refusing to give up the particular lane their cars occupy.'' Traffic police, who stand at intersections and in the middle of major streets rain or shine, are disrespectful to drivers and do n't help matters, Pravda said Drivers can not get a license without a six-month course, but once they receive it, it's theirs for life unless it is revoked for repeated traffic regulation violations. There is no program for license renewal or periodic testing. Roads also are under severe climatic stress from severe cold in winter to relative warm in winter. The temperature extremes, combined with the weight of thousands of military and government trucks that rumble over the roads daily, often cause huge potholes. `` Urgent measures, including a special national program, should be taken to combat accidents on Soviet roads,'' Pravda said. `` It's time that programs for teaching driving should be changed and instead of studying parts of the car and spending considerable time on it, it could be more useful if the actual driving and traffic rules are studied more thoroughly,'' it said.

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> claimed victory Thursday after partial returns showed her populist party leading in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first open National Assembly elections in more than a decade. With 165 of 205 districts reporting, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had 76 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>; its main rival, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, had 39; and the remaining 46 went to independent and minor parties. The nine-party <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> includes loyalists of President <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, the military president who died in a plane crash three months ago. If her party wins a majority in the Assembly, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> would likely be named prime minister, becoming the first woman to lead this Islamic nation. Without a majority, the party will be forced to forge a governing coalition. `` The victory the <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION> achieved is because of the selfless sacrifices, the struggle by people of the <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told the news conference after a rally of about 8,000 people on the lawn of her family home in the southern city of <LOCATION> Larkana </LOCATION>. The crowd chanted `` Long Live Benazir!'' and `` <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON>, prime minister!'' Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s main rivals from the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, conceded defeat late Wednesday in his bid for an assembly seat. `` We're on the losing side,'' he said of his defeat by a <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate in his hometown of <LOCATION> Sindhri </LOCATION>. He said the <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> party had `` succeeded very well'' nationally. The chairman of the Alliance, <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jatoi </PERSON>, lost in both districts he contested to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> People's Party candidates. Under Pakistani rules, candidates may contest more than one seat to improve their chance of election but must forfeit all but one. The vacant seats are contested later in by-elections. The other main rival of Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, chief minister <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, claimed victory in the race for an assembly seat in <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION>, his hometown, but lost to a <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> member in another district. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, won the last open election in 1977 by a landslide and prompted a coup by Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was convicted of complicity in a murder conspiracy and hanged in 1979. About 48 million of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s 107 million people were eligible to vote and unofficial estimates said slightly more than half voted. Illiterate millions chose their candidates by symbol _ an arrow for the <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> party, a bicycle for the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and other symbols such as a ladder, flower or ink pot for nearly 30 smaller parties. Men and women voted separately, in keeping with strict Moslem practice. At stake were 205 of the 207 Moslem seats and 10 for non-Moslems in the 237-member National Assembly. The remaining 20 seats are reserved for women and will be filled later by vote of the assembly. Voting for two Moslem seats was postponed because of the death of an elderly candidate in each district. On Saturday, Pakistanis vote to fill the 483 seats in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s four provincial assemblies Both major parties have said they would maintain the long-standing friendship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and continue support for Moslem guerrillas fighting the communist government in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Of more than 5 million Afghans who have fled during 10 years of civil war, at least 3 million live in Pakistani border cities and refugee camps that serve as bases and supply points for the insurgents. Police and soldiers in armored vehicles patrolled several cities Wednesday, especially in <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION>, a southern province noted for ethnic violence. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s constitution requires the president to choose the person who will form the next government, presumably the leader of the strongest party in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, the interim president, will have no deadline for the choice but the constitution the new assembly must convene within 30 days and a new government must pass a confidence vote within 60 days after that. Asked late Wednesday whether he would be reluctant to designate a woman as head of government, <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> replied: `` I think a woman prime minister might be a good change.'' Both the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> founded, and the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> have pledged to continue <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s policy of increasing the influence of Islam in the nation's life. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> has said, however, that she would not allow the religious policy to work against the rights of women or minorities. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled for eight years under martial law after the coup, then held national elections in 1985 in which political parties were not allowed to compete. Major opposition groups boycotted the elections, including Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and her supporters. In May, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> dismissed <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>'s government and dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, alleging corruption, incompetence and delay in applying Islamic law. He called this election before the Aug. 17 plane crash that killed him, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and 28 other people.

 For the final state dinner of their eight-year White House reign, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> hosted a glittering night of nostalgic song and dance to honor their conservative friend, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Breaking protocol, the Thatchers dallied Wednesday after the evening's entertainment and took a turn with the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> about the marbled Grand Foyer to the tune of `` Shall We Dance?'' Usually, the honored guests depart posthaste, but the Thatchers and the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> even switched partners as they smiled for the cameras. `` I wanted this to be special _ it's very sentimental,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who said she got `` a little teary'' during the effusive round of toasts that the president and prime minister offered each other earlier in the evening. The president, asked about his `` last dance'' with his first lady, quipped, `` You do n't mean that <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> and I are breaking up, do you?'' With their 55th state dinner, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> closed the book on one of their favorite White House events. Their elaborate celebrations recalled a tradition of glitz and glamour dating to the first White House social event, when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> greeted New Years Day revelers in 1801. Although many presidents made the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> a stage for some of the nation's most elaborate and exclusive entertainment, the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> brought a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> party style to an executive mansion shorn of hard liquor and dancing during the Carter years. And so it was Wednesday evening, when pianist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Feinstein </PERSON> entertained with tunes ranging from Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s favorite, `` Our Love Is Here to Stay,'' to `` I'll Be Seeing You,'' a tune played at the first state dinner honoring Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Feb. 26, 1981, a month after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> took office. The black-tie tribute to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and her husband <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> was an apt finale to a glittering series in which <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, now 77, never seemed to tire. As he has on every such evening, the president regaled his guests with anecdotes, both at the dinner table and among the demitasse-sipping guests in the Blue Room. Even Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was caught up in the wave of nostalgia. Her parting gift to the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> was a leather photograph album containing nine black and white photographs from the president's 1949 movie `` The Hasty Heart,'' which he filmed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> In the toasts, superlatives were the order of the night. `` She is a leader with the vision and the courage to stay the course until the battles are won,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said of his guest. Even though his voice was raspy, the president pressed on to say, `` The impact of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s leadership at home and abroad secures her place in history. `` As I prepare to depart this office in January, I take considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will still reside at No. 10 Downing Street.'' The prime minister praised <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> as `` more than a staunch ally and counselor. You have also been a wonderful friend to me and our country.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> saluted as well the first lady, whose `` charm, dignity and quiet but sure courage have won the hearts of millions.'' She also said she wanted to `` warmly congratulate'' Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> on his recent election, adding that she looked forward `` to working with you as a true and trusted friend.'' Noticeably absent was Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who was n't invited When his absence from the guest list was noted earlier this week, White House aides said he had been to a state dinner in 1982 as a senator. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the guest list included Reps. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, R-Wyo., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., as well <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, R-Ore., and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>. Also present were American Ballet Theatre artistic director <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, Discovery space shuttle commander <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodgers </ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON> Orel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershiser </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> general director <PERSON> Beverley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sills </PERSON>, and author <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> For the evening, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> was turned into a garden of peach roses, with a topiary tree composed of more than 100 full-bloomed flowers perched atop each of the 13 tables. More roses were scattered in bouquets about the candlelit room. Some 120 guests dined on the famed $ 200,000 ivory, red and gold <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> china, using vermeil flatware and unadorned crystal goblets. They sat at tables covered in peach linen and dabbed their spills with white damask napkins adorned with the presidential seal. According to the first lady's press office, the guests were served: baby lobster bellevue, caviar yogurt sauce and curried croissant; roasted saddle of veal perigourdine; jardiniere of vegetables; asparagus with hazel nut butter; autumn mixed salad and a selection of cheeses; and chestnut marquise with pistachio sauce, orange tuiles and ginger twigs. That was washed down with a <LOCATION> Saintsbury </LOCATION> Chardonnay Reserve 1987; <ORGANIZATION> Stag </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabernet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sauvignon </ORGANIZATION> 1978 and <LOCATION> Schramsberg </LOCATION> Crement Demi Sec 1984.

<HEAD>Records Reveal Rooming House Landlady's Odd Past</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Buried Bodies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 She appeared to be a grandmotherly landlady who took in the homeless, but court records show the woman arrested in the deaths of seven tenants was a dangerous eccentric who preyed on the ill and elderly for years. The records indicate that 59-year-old <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, who was arrested late Wednesday in downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> after a five-day search, could be kind and generous one moment and cunning and cruel the next. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> had not been seen since Saturday, when police allowed her to walk away from her Victorian rooming house after the first of seven bodies was unearthed in the yard. Her estranged daughter, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, described her as `` shy, withdrawn and reserved'' with `` no real personality.'' Doctors discovered she may have a penchant for poisoning as far back as 1980, according to a probation report. Police believe <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> killed tenants to collect their Social Security benefits. They have a list of two dozen people who are missing and who might have lived at <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>'s eight-bedroom house at one time or another. One former tenant, <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, told reporters Wednesday that he and other tenants unknowingly helped <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> dispose of the bodies by digging the makeshift graves. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 74, said <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> first asked him to dig a hole in the back yard for an apricot tree. `` She said she had contacted a nursery and they told her she needed a hole that was 4 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep. I thought that was a little deep. Now I know why.'' Court documents, including a record of her first conviction for forging checks in 1948, paint the picture of a conniving, manipulative woman who can concoct a story for any occasion. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> herself, in letters to a judge preparing to sentence her on unrelated charges in 1982, described her life as plagued with hardship, four failed marriages, abuse and the responsibility of supporting some of her numerous brothers and sisters. In the court documents, most of which were filed in connection with search or arrest warrants, <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> claimed to be of Mexican descent, the youngest of 18 children. However, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> recorded her birth as <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, on Jan. 19, 1929, in <LOCATION> Redlands </LOCATION>, to <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, an ex-serviceman, and <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, a housewife. The first complaints that <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> may have been involved in poisoning came in early 1980, when doctors at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> conducted a toxicology test on an emergency room patient, 79-year-old <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>'s physician, Dr. <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON>, recalled that he first suspected <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, his patient's live-in companion, of poisoning <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> with overdoses of a heart medication he had prescribed. <PERSON> Lackner </PERSON> notified officials of the county <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> agency `` that <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> was poisoning or making <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> sick by overmedicating her, and that I suspected that she was ripping Mrs. <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> off.'' `` They were able to check, and found out that Mrs. <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>'s -LRB- Social Security -RRB- check had been cashed and that the endorsement was a forgery,'' he said `` I told <PERSON> Esther </PERSON> what was going on, and she got rid of <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>.'' That occurrence and a similar one led to a warning to all <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> hospitals about <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, a criminal investigation by county authorities, and <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>'s 1982 arrest on charges of forgery, grand theft and `` administering stupefying drugs.'' While in custody, <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> claimed that all her surviving brothers and sisters in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> depended on her for financial support. `` When I was 3 years old, I had to start picking cotton, potatoes, cucumbers, chilies, then fruits,'' <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> wrote in one of two letters to <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>. `` I finally married when I was 13, he died after a few days.'' <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> told the judge in one of the letters that she remarried after her first husband died. That marriage ended in divorce after 18 years, and she later married `` a Mr. <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON>,'' who she claimed beat her and stabbed her between the eyes. `` It was -LRB- during -RRB- this time I started writing checks,'' she said. `` I just wanted you to know I'm not a street bum. All my problems started when I married Mr. <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is following the traditional route to power by women politicians in the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> subcontinent. She capitalized on family ties and played on the emotions of crowds who remembered her executed father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. But an iron will behind the tears served her well in her foray into the male-dominated political arena in a region where most women have yet to achieve economic, educational and professional parity. Like the daughters and widows of fallen leaders in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>, she is a savvy, charismatic, intelligent student of politics who graduated into leadership ranks in her own right. The most famous _ and the one who left the deepest mark on her own nation and on the world _ was <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was considered a pliable young lady and the ideal compromise candidate when the squabbling cronies of her late father, Prime Minister <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, had to anoint a new leader of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s dominant <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. She proved to be anything but pliable. Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> governed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as prime minister from 1966 to 1977, turning a country where bullock carts and bicycles are major means of transportation into a nuclear power and a mighty military force. Her increasingly authoritarian measures handed her a crushing election defeat after her first 11 years in power, but she bounced back into office in 1980 with a resounding comeback victory. She governed another four years until she was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards in revenge for the army raid she had ordered to flush out gunmen holed up the Sikh faith's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple in <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. The first woman political leader in the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> subcontinent was <PERSON> Sirimavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Her husband, Prime Minister S.W.R.D. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON>, was assassinated by a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monk in 1959. The following year, with his <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in a shambles, the male politicians turned to his widow as the person most capable of restoring unity. Mrs. <PERSON> Bandaranaike </PERSON> governed from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977, when voters rebelled against her stringent economic controls. But she has rebounded again and is now the leading opposition candidate in the presidential election set for Dec. 19. In <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, women have not captured the top office. But the two strongest opposition leaders are women: <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Awami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Khaleda </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bangladesh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hasina </PERSON> is the daughter of Sheik <PERSON> Mujibur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, the prime minister who was assassinated in a coup in 1975. Mrs. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> is the widow of another assassinated prime minister, <PERSON> Ziaur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, who died in a 1981 coup. All the women leaders have invoked the memories and the popularity, as they perceive it, of their fathers and husbands. But none has done it as eloquently as <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. In the opening chapter of her recently published autobiography, `` Daughter of the East,'' she recounts the moment of her father's execution, which was sanctioned by the man who overthrew him, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>: `` They killed my father in the early morning hours of April 4, 1979, inside <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION> Central Jail Imprisoned with my mother a few miles away in a deserted police training camp at <LOCATION> Sihala </LOCATION>, I felt the moment of my father's death. `` I suddenly sat bolt-upright in bed at 2 a.m. ` No!' the scream burst through the knots in my throat. ` No!' I could n't breathe, did n't want to breathe. ` Papa, Papa!' I felt so cold.'' And then she resolved to avenge his death, in her oft-repeated campaign words, by `` restoring democracy in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.''

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> once recalled a day nearly a decade ago when she visited her father in jail as he awaited execution by the military regime that had toppled his civilian government. `` I told him on my oath in his death cell, I would carry on his work,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said. Her father, former Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, was hanged in a <LOCATION> Rawalpindi </LOCATION> prison in 1979, two years after being convicted in a murder conspiracy. Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, who led the coup that unseated <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, turned down international pleas for sparing him. Today, three months after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> died in a plane crash, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> claimed victory in national elections and is likely to become the first woman prime minister of a modern Moslem nation. She is the undisputed star of Pakistani politics as head of the populist <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> founded by her father. The charismatic 35-year-old Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> inherited the grass-roots following that brought her father to power in the 1970s. In speech after speech to adoring crowds, she has promised a better life to the poor rural masses that form the core of this Islamic nation. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was groomed for politics, studying by the side of her father, then focusing on politics and government while at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. Her first taste of political success came at the British university, where she was elected president of the <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> in 1976. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in early 1977 to take up a job in the foreign office. The job was short-lived, however, as <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> toppled <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s government a few months later. Her father was accused of conspiring to murder a political opponent and was sentenced to death. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> turned to denouncing <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> after her struggle to have her father reprieved failed. She wound up in jail or under house arrest for five years. Not until a serious ear infection required treatment did <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> allow her release in 1984 to go to <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in self-exile. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> returned triumphantly to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in April 1986, four months after <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> announced an end to eight years of military rule. She drew huge crowds as she toured the nation demanding democracy. Ecstatic crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands would chant her name and wait for hours for a glimpse of her. The stunning comeback led to inevitable comparisons with <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, who became president after a popular and military uprising against <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> steadfastly refused to allow elections contested by political parties. In the meantime, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> surprised many observers by agreeing to an arranged marriage last December with <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Asif </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Zardari </PERSON> that followed strict Islamic tradition. Six months later, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> fired his civilian government. In July, he set Nov. 16 as the date for new elections. There was considerable speculation that <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who died in an Aug. 17 plane crash, chose the date because he knew Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was pregnant with her first child and hoped to keep her off the campaign trail. But the elections came two months after Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> gave birth to a son, <PERSON> Bilawal </PERSON>, giving her time to make whirlwind campaign tours throughout the country after a brief bout with a kidney infection. In public, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> is mindful of local custom and Islamic morality, appearing with her head covered and wearing the baggy <LOCATION> Shalwar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kameez </LOCATION> favored by most Pakistani women. But she is clearly Westernized and is as comfortable speaking English as <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION>. Poised and articulate, she has captivated massive crowds almost everywhere she travels in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. In early November, she mounted a 38-hour, 31-stop railway tour aboard the green-and-yellow `` Khyber Mail'' train that wound its way 1,000 miles through the country's hinterland Her voice deteriorated into a barely audible rasp as she preached the <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> message handed down by her late father: democracy and prosperity to the poor masses.

<HEAD>Urban Schools Handicapped By Textbook Shortage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Severe textbook shortages are undercutting education in urban school districts nationwide because of higher book prices, budgetary constraints and a tendency to cut books before people, educators complain. `` One of the things about textbooks is they do n't vote and they do n't go out on strike. If you cut personnel, you get screams of anguish,'' said <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson-Bernstein </PERSON>, author of `` A Conspiracy of Good Intentions: <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Textbook Fiasco,'' a new book highly critical of the textbook industry. A study of 31 schools in five urban districts by the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION>, released in September, found an across-the-board lack of instructional materials, including textbooks. `` In general, the resource situation is pretty bleak. The lack of supplies in the school systems is pretty obvious,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, policy resource director for the private, non-profit think tank. `` This is often an area of the budget where funding is cut.'' But the textbook shortage compromises educational quality, some principals contend. `` One of the teachers said it was like building a house without any nails,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. At Mather elementary school in a working-class <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> neighborhood, the second grade does n't have enough math textbooks, the fourth grade needs social studies books and the sixth grade lacks language texts. Health books are missing entirely in the school of 550 students. Forced to pare its budget, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last spring eliminated $ 1.3 million in funding for instructional supplies, leaving $ 3.7 million for textbooks, paper, pencils and other materials. `` It's one of the few variable costs you have in the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON>, deputy superintendent for planning and business affairs for the 58,000-student system. Higher book costs also have hurt. `` It was a choice when we came to it between things like textbooks or librarians or nurses or athletic programs or field trips,'' he said Wednesday. In the September study of schools in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, 20 of the 31 schools surveyed said they had `` serious problems'' with instructional materials, and 19 said the level of resources was inadequate. `` We know that every kid ca n't have every book because that's just not feasible,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, an assistant superintendent in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s 58,000-student district `` It's always a problem. Resources change, books change and you want to keep up to date and the money is not always there. What a school has to do is some prioritizing.'' In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, setting priorities has forced some schools to use more photocopied material than usual _ 60,000 copies a month at Mather. Many students are n't allowed to take textbooks home for fear they will be lost or damaged. Teachers often spend money out of their own paychecks for materials. Others go without and work at the blackboard more. School officials also said some of the city's 7,000 bilingual program students only have new reading textbooks in Spanish because the city failed to order enough books in English. Students in the <ORGANIZATION> Agassiz </ORGANIZATION> elementary school _ where textbooks never go home _ are sharing readers, Principal <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> said. The textbook shortage in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> comes despite a city survey of parents three years ago that found instructional materials were the No. 1 priority among 25 educational issues. Officials increased funding for materials in response to the finding before the budget constraints forced the cutbacks this year. National education lobbyists said cities should find other areas to cut before slashing resources used directly by students. `` If we see education as an investment, then we will provide those funds and wo n't have to make those cuts,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON>, associate executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Sudanese rebels and a political party in the country's coalition government have signed an agreement calling for a constitutional conference next month to end the civil war in <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s south. The agreement, signed Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, also calls for a cease-fire in the 5 -LCB- - year conflict, cancellation of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s defense pacts with other countries, suspension of harsh Islamic laws and lifting the state of `` It is time for reason to prevail, high time to end the fratricidal war,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Mirghani </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the second largest in Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON>'s coalition government. He said the agreement was backed by <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s biggest. `` The Prime Minister telephoned last night and fully expressed his support to the meeting,'' <PERSON> El-Mirghani </PERSON> said. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the third coalition partner, has expressed reservations, especially to suspending Islamic law and lifting the state of emergency. The rebels took up arms against the Moslem-dominated <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government in 1983 to press for autonomy and social reform in the predominantly Christian and animist south. The rebels claim to control 95 percent of the southern countryside and small towns. Because of the war, a third of southern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s 6 million civilians have fled in search of a haven in northern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The undersea exploration of a Roman shipwreck will be witnessed by thousands of students via `` telepresence,'' an on-the-spot TV broadcast brought to them by the discoverers of the wreck of the Titanic. Plans for the unprecedented educational project were unveiled Wednesday by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, who led the team that found the sunken Titanic in 1985. Students linked by satellite to at least nine science museums in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will be able to communicate with explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the floor of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. While the $ 6 million, privately funded project involves several advances in technology, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said its main purpose is to excite students about science, a field that he said has suffered dwindling influence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We really have a crisis of education in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said at a news conference at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. In recent years, he said, science has failed to provide young people with attractive role models. The role models they have instead are `` that scientists are nerds, or as my kids would say, dweebs, and dweebs sit at terminals and are dropouts from society.'' In the project, the underwater robot named <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> that helped explore the Titanic will send high-quality television pictures via cable to a ship thousands of feet above on the sea surface. For 14 days next May, the ship and its 50-member crew _ including six high school students _ will control the movements of the robot and send back satellite images from two underwater locations. The broadcasts will be transmitted via the <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to science museums in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> plans to produce a TV special on the expedition. The ship's crew will broadcast six programs a day, or a total of 84 40-minute programs, that will be seen by about 200,000 students. Instead of simply watching the programs, the students will have before them a multiscreen `` control room'' that replicates the control center on the mother ship above <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>. Students will be able to ask questions of the crew, see images on a number of television screens and, in some cases, even take over the controls of <PERSON> Jason </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> called the concept `` telepresence.'' The plan is for <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> to explore an undersea volcano field off the west coast of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> where minor eruptions, emissions of molten minerals and an abundance of wildlife should be visible. At another <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> site, which <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> declined to disclose, <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> will photograph a vast debris field believed to be the remains of several Roman shipwrecks from the second century. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said the goals of the program, which he calls the `` <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Project </PERSON>,'' are both ambitious and basic. `` One of the major focuses of the program is to teach people where the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> is,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. `` It's a tremendous interest-generator,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ireton </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is helping science teachers who will take their classes to the programs. `` If we have 200,000 students and we interest 10 percent of them in science, my gosh, that's a tremendous benefit,'' he said.

While the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief said the information explosion in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is `` very welcome and very healthy,'' it also requires the agency to determine `` what is real versus what <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> wants us to hear.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s `` military capability, its efforts to increase global influence and its aggressive intelligence activities are still serious threats to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> interests. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to reform his country have not fundamentally altered these truths,'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said, adding that they arguably may make the Soviets an even greater threat <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> fielded questions from students after his speech and held a news conference _ rare for a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief. When asked by reporters if Soviet spying had decreased as a result of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> answered, `` No.'' When asked if Soviet spying had increased, he responded, `` Possibly,'' adding that there is `` very intensive intelligence work.'' He did not elaborate. Whatever arms control agreements the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reaches with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said in his speech, `` I believe that our relationship is likely to remain essentially adversarial.'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is an impressive leader, `` when we watch the leadership, we also have to see what actual reforms are being made in terms of military activity, aggressive intelligence against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, improvements in civil rights and all the things that are important to us. Here we are still waiting for progress.'' On the subject of the war on drugs, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the role of intelligence gathering in the battle has not been well-defined, but that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to change that. He said he believes drug interdiction is the most expensive and least effective way to deal with the problem. The only real solution, he said, lies in `` reduced demand coupled with a real reduction in supply.'' Asked by a student about his future as <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> chief under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said he had not yet been contacted by the president-elect's transition team. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said the president-elect, a former chief of the agency, had asked that he receive daily briefings from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>. Defending the use of covert action in furthering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said that as an an alternative to military action, `` I think it is very important.'' Covert action went awry in the Iran-Contra affair because trading arms for hostages was not consistent with the country's overt policy, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> was not seen to be institutionally involved in the Iran-Contra affair, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> said, adding that the individuals who violated agency rules were carrying out instructions from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>.

 The conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> says it has ended efforts to annul results of the July 6 election and will now adopt the role of responsible democratic opposition to President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. The party said Wednesday that it still maintains <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, won in a fraudulent election. <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Tovar </PERSON>, National Action's secretary general, called on <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> to begin his term Dec. 1 with `` a transition to a real democracy.'' In a statement, he said <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> could `` legitimize himself'' by `` respecting the popular mandate of democratization, pluralism, social justice and national sovereignty.'' It was the first public acceptance of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' victory by a major Mexican opposition party. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON>, National Action's presidential candidate, previously had called upon President <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> de la <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> to annul the election results and appoint an interim president until a new ballot could be held. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won with slightly more than 50 percent of the vote, the slimmest margin of victory in the governing party's 59-year history. The party has not lost a presidential election since its founding in 1929. <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> coalition came in second with 31 percent and <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> finished third with 17 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The National Action statement said the party had adopted a position as `` a responsible democratic opposition.'' The statement also called for a revision of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s election code to ensure fraud-free elections.

 <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a tobacco-chewing woman who has been been institionalized since 1909, will be certified by the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> as the world's oldest living person on her 114th birthday Friday. <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who was born in 1874 during the second term of President <PERSON> Ulysses </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> and two years before <PERSON> Custer </PERSON>'s last stand at <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Big </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>, will celebrate her birthday with a cake decorated with 114 candles and receive her formal world record certificate from Guinness. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Putnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> lives, know very little about her. She has no living relatives and has been under hospital care for 79 years. <PERSON> Marjorie </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s guardian since 1984, said she learned four years ago that Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> was at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chattahoochee </LOCATION> and had been there since Nov. 19, 1909, the day after her 35th birthday. Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> was diagnosed when she was admitted to the hospital as suffering from post-typhoid psychosis, though Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> has no clear record of an outbreak of typhoid fever at that time. Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> learned the name of Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Joiner </PERSON>, from the commitment records at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Her father's name was <PERSON> John </PERSON> Her guardian arranged to have the woman moved to the <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convalescence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gainesville </LOCATION>, and she was transferred in 1986 to the nursing home in <LOCATION> Palatka </LOCATION> where Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s husband <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> is administrator. Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> refuses to discuss the past. `` She will not go back. With <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON>, it is the now. I do n't delve into that very much. It's like she put up a steel wall,'' she said. Records show Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON> taught piano in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> and married <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who did some blacksmithing. Her daily routine at the nursing home is to have breakfast in bed and then spend the day caring for her possessions, including dolls and stuffed animals. She also likes to chew tobacco, preferring Red Man. `` You do n't need teeth to chew tobacco, I guess,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. Guinness based its decision to declare Mrs. White the oldest living person on evidence from extensive medical and state records, according to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihle </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the nursing home. The 1989 <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION>, already published, lists 112-year-old <PERSON> Birdie </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> as the oldest living person. Others have claimed the title, but <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> said it requires `` adequate authentication.''

<HEAD>Riot Police Battle Protesters Marching On U.S. Embassy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Riot police fired volleys of tear gas today to drive back thousands of farmers chanting `` Drive out the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>'' as they tried to march on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to demand a halt to American farm imports. Some 2,000 riot police in green combat fatigues and black, visored helmets blocked 7,000 farmers and other protesters who tried to get to the embassy in central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` Drive out <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialists,'' and `` Oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products,'' protesters shouted as they marched to the beat of drums and carried hundreds of red, white and yellow flags and placards denouncing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Hundreds of protesters hurled rocks and bricks at riot police and attacked troopers with clubs after they were blocked a few hundred yards from the embassy. Radical students who joined the march hurled a few firebombs at police. Police fired tear gas and hurled back rocks tossed by protesters. Some officers and protesters were seen being taken away with injuries, but police had no figures on injuries or arrests. No protesters got close to the embassy. Marchers dispersed after about 90 minutes of clashes confined mainly to one main street. Protesters claimed their farms were threatened by cheap food imports, such as those from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many protesters wore headbands saying, `` No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine and beef.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been pressuring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to open its markets to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> imports, especially agricultural products, to help correct <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s $ 10 billion annual trade debt with <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has made some concessions on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> beef, wine and other food imports. Angry farmers repeatedly have protested against any import concessions, but the protest today was the most violent. The farmers' march turned violent when police stopped it just before it passed the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank. Police repeatedly charged the rock-throwing protesters to drive them back. Several thousand more riot police ringed the embassy and guarded streets leading to the building. Police also protected nearby residences of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. The protesters also denounced former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> and demanded he be arrested for corruption and human rights abuses. `` Kill <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>,'' some people in the crowd yelled. The farmers had rallied near the National Assembly building and then marched peacefully the six miles to the embassy, shepherded by columns of riot police. Many people watching cheered the protesters and shouted encouragement. Large numbers of Koreans oppose imports. The rally became as much a protest against <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many Koreans are demanding the former president be punished for alleged corruption and human rights abuses. Several of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s relatives and former associates have been convicted or charged with corruption. The government is trying to defuse the controversy by having <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> apologize to the nation and return his personal wealth. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, a former general, who took power with military backing in 1980, is resisting demands he accept exile to the countryside in disgrace. He insists he did nothing wrong personally during his seven-year term that ended in February.

 Two researchers who helped explain the chemical origins of life, a doctor who developed methadone treatment for heroin addicts and a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator have received the 1988 <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> Awards. The Lasker Awards, announced Wednesday, have been given for 43 years and have often foreshadowed the awarding of Nobel Prizes. Forty-six Lasker award winners have gone on to win Nobels. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cech </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, were awarded the Lasker Basic Medical Research Award for their separate discoveries concerning the workings of RNA, one of the genetic building blocks on which life depends. The Lasker Clinical Medical Research Award went to Dr. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for discoveries concerning the physiological basis of drug addiction and the development of methadone as an effective treatment. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>., who was defeated in his bid for re-election Nov. 8, was awarded the Lasker Public Service Award for his defense of health care programs faced by crippling budget cuts and for establishing new programs Each Lasker award winner receives or shares a $ 15,000 honorarium. One of this year's winners of the Nobel Prize in medicine, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, won a Lasker award in 1976. <PERSON> Cech </PERSON>, a biochemist, was cited for his discovery that RNA _ once thought to be merely a kind of genetic messenger inside cells _ could rearrange itself to change the message. He also found that the RNA, or ribonucleic acid, has a rudimentary ability to reproduce itself, suggesting that the first living things might have arisen ultimately from RNA. Earlier, <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> had reported that only part of RNA carried genetic instructions to govern the operation of cells. Certain segments of RNA, called introns, are deleted from RNA as it is processed, and the remaining segments, called exons, contain the instructions. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> began his studies of addiction in the 1960s. After obtaining permission to study heroin addicts outside of prison, he examined the symptoms of withdrawal and the nature of addiction. Ultimately, he found that methadone, a synthetic opiate developed in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during World War II, could eliminate an addict's craving for heroin without making the addict `` high.'' That allowed addicts to hold jobs and resume normal lives. <PERSON> Weicker </PERSON> was cited, in part, `` for his compassion and dedication in the fight to eradicate disease and disability through federal funding of medical research and public health programs.'' Among the beneficiaries of his legislative actions were disabled children, the mentally ill, the elderly and people suffering from cancer, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis and AIDS, the <ORGANIZATION> Lasker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said.

 A psychiatric patient who threatened to shoot herself in front of actress <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gless </PERSON> was ordered by a judge to stay away from the co-star of the `` <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>'' television series. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewin </PERSON> issued a permanent restraining order Wednesday that said <PERSON> Joni </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> must remain 200 yards away from <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gless </PERSON>' family members and stay 1,000 yards away from the actress' home and residences of her family members, said her attorney and brother, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gless </PERSON>. `` She's being treated for fan obsession,'' he said of Ms. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>. `` Before, all the police could do was ask her not to trespass. Now they can arrest her for violation of a court order.'' Neither Miss Gless or Ms. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> appeared in court. Miss <PERSON> Gless </PERSON>, who won two Emmy awards for her portrayal of dedicated police officer <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> on the now-canceled CBS-TV series, has received 20 letters from Ms. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, a self-described fan, since Jan. 19. Ms. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> threatened to shoot herself in front of the actress, according to a letter submitted to the court by Ms. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>'s psychiatrist, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gless </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> was a frequent fixture near the `` <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>'' set, hovering outside studio doors at dawn to await Miss <PERSON> Gless </PERSON>' arrival, then following the sound truck to the filming location.

 If you're a Scrooge about Christmas you might want to head for <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, where it seems there's a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> shortage. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Galey </PERSON>, director of the non-profit Rent-A-Santa program, says that for the first time in the program's six-year history it is short on recruits for the ho-ho-ho role. `` We have 10 and need 40,'' he said. The recruits undergo a week-long training program for duty beginning right after Thanksgiving, <PERSON> Galey </PERSON> said. The program is part of the the <ORGANIZATION> Mile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> unit of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>. The job pays $ 10 the first hour and $ 5 per hour after that, he said. Costumes are supplied. `` Last year we did 375 assignments between Thanksgiving and Christmas Eve and that was with about 28 Santas. This year we need 40 already,'' <PERSON> Galey </PERSON> said. `` I'm just thinking off the top of my head that because our economy has been a bit in the doldrums, people are n't looking forward to the Christmas holidays as early this year as they have in past years,'' he said to explain the shortage of Santas in training. The program's Santas, which have ranged from truck drivers to attorneys, see duty at private parties in homes, office parties, shopping centers, day care centers and anywhere else that Christmas parties are held for children. `` They are generally people who look forward to the holidays and love playing the part of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> and have a good time doing it. It would n't be Christmas for them if they did n't have a chance to play <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 A name game has the residents of a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> and this <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> city all in a stew. Both <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, claim to be the home of <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> stew, a tasty concoction of smoked meat, chicken, corn, baby lima beans, tomatoes, onions, secret ingredients and assorted seasonings. Georgian's traditionally cook their <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> stew in black iron wash pots over an open fire, which gives the stew a distinctive, smoky flavor. Virginians cook theirs in large stainless-steel kettles similar to those used in military mess kitchens. In February, the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s House of Representatives each passed resolutions declaring its state the stew's `` official'' birthplace. On Saturday, there will be a second attempt to settle the issue with a cook-off, this time in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. Virginians won a similar competition in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> last year that featured judges from that state, according to <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Taunton </PERSON>, one of the sponsors. She said Georgians will claim the title this year, which is being judged by locals. `` Naturally, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> lost that competition,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Taunton </PERSON> said. `` But I'm confident we'll regain the national <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> stew title this Saturday at high noon, when the judges announce their decision.'' Nonetheless, more than 50 Virginians are expected. They say they are bringing a new, $ 5,000 stainless-steel stew kettle to compete in the contest.

<HEAD>Study Shows Cocaine Users Now Abusing Tranquilizers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A dramatic increase in tranquilizer use by cocaine abusers is worrying counselors nationwide, who fear the double dangers of dual addictions. Tranquilizers like Valium, used to ease the `` crash'' of a cocaine high by calming nerves and relieving paranoia, are becoming a second drug of choice among cocaine users, according to a study released Wednesday by the city's Haight Ashbury Free Clinic. But cocaine users, particularly those who smoke the potent form known as crack, take tranquilizers in such quantity that the effects are reversed and users often become more agitated, unpredictable and violent, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, the clinic's founder and medical director. The `` dual-drug'' phenomenon parallels the `` speedballing'' habits of heroin addicts 20 years ago, who supplemented their barbiturates with amphetamines, he said. Valium and the tranquilizer Xanax, which overtook Valium last year as the most-prescribed benzodiazepine tranquilizer in the country, are long-acting drugs that can produce seizures when taken at high doses. They also can lead to severe addictions that are hard to kick, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` We believe we have identified a valid trend nationwide, and other independent sources support it,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The study surveyed 3,000 workers in 339 chemical dependency treatment programs across the nation on a variety of questions. It found that many reported a growing dual-drug problem. Data on hospital emergency room drug overdoses, addiction treatment admissions and law enforcement seizure statistics support the study results, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, emergency room overdoses have increased 77 percent this year compared to 1987. `` The emergency room data suggest not only were we correct, but it's worse than we thought,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` It's clearly a trend and we've not peaked out yet.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the widespread dual-drug phenomenon warrants expanded treatment centers, supply-reduction efforts and education programs for drug users and physicians. Although cocaine users also use alcohol to take the edge off, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said researchers are particularly fearful of the cocaine-tranquilizer combination. `` When you combine two drugs ... it multiplies. Instead of one plus one equalling two, it's three, four, five or six,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Linebarger </PERSON>, a chemical dependency therapist at a center south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` They cancel each other out, but it ends up being much more poisonous to the system.'' Tranquilizers can ease the emotional and physical depression that follows a cocaine `` high,'' <PERSON> Linebarger </PERSON> explained. A secondary dependence on tranquilizers can go unnoticed by a cocaine addict, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Physicians may prescribe tranquilizers for patients who complain of feeling anxious and paranoid, not realizing the symptoms are a result of cocaine use, he said. Prescription tranquilizers also are available on the street through wholesale diversions and international smuggling, he said. Although the cocaine epidemic appeared to be leveling off in 1983, the introduction of crack cocaine in 1984 produced record levels of dual-drug dependence, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` Any time you see an increase in an upper, you'll see an increase in downers, and any time you see an increase in downers, you'll see an increase in uppers,'' he said. `` Smokable forms of cocaine are really the fuel for this.'' The study was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Section </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Haight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ashbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in conjunction with the Research Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Merritt-Peralta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dependency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>.

 Israeli troops shot and wounded 10 Palestinians in clashes in the occupied lands today, and the army eased a six-day curfew aimed at blocking violence fueled by the Palestinian declaration of independence. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> dismissed the declaration of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state in the Israeli-occupied territories as a `` PLO deception attempt,'' and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> launched a diplomatic offensive on Wednesday to counter it. Hospital officials said 10 Palestinians were shot and wounded when soldiers opened fire on rioting youths near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and several areas of the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Among the wounded were a 15-year-old girl shot in the back and a 34-year-old woman hit in the left thigh, they said. The army said it was checking the reports. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jersualem </LOCATION> today, two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> policemen were injured by rocks at an Arab boys' school, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. He said riot police then entered <ORGANIZATION> Rashadiye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and arrested eight students. A teacher said trouble started when police arrived to quiet students singing Palestinian patriotic songs in the school's courtyard The teacher would not give his name. The army lifted curfews from several towns in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, home to 650,000 Palestinians, but kept curfews in effect for the 250,000 who live in refugee camps. A curfew also was maintained on the Nur Shams refugee camp near <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Telephone lines remained cut off to homes and businesses for a seventh day in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, but the army said they would be restored during the day. The lines were severed to prevent Palestinians from coordinating anti-Israeli activities during the meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, which ended Tuesday with the declaration of independence The government, meanwhile, confirmed that Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> ordered <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> not to show scenes of jubilation at the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting in order not to incite Palestinians in the territories. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, who has been defense minister in charge of quelling violence during the 11-month Palestinian uprising, told <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television Wednesday night that quiet could be restored in three to six months. `` I believe that the events of the last several days can become a turning point leading to a significant decrease in violence,'' he said. He expressed hope that many Palestinians would be content with `` achieving their aim and allowing the political process'' but said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` should continue to supress violence and block the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> deception attempt by political action.'' In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials announced a diplomatic campaign against the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s drive for recognition of its self-proclaimed state The effort will focus on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to renounce terrorism, to accept U.N. Resolution 242 unconditionally or to clearly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, one official said. He said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will argue that the resolution, which implicitly recognizes the the Jewish state's right to exist, can not be amended The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> said it was accepting the resolution on condition the Palestinian right to self-determination is also recognized. Palestinian hardliners said they opposed the declaration, and the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- movement called a three-day general strike to protest the declaration's implicit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> complained that recognition of the would-be <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state would interfere with any peace process. He told reporters that recognition, now by more than 20 mostly Arab countries, `` further complicates the situation by supporting something that should n't be supported.'' On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> kept up their nightly revelry celebrating the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> independence statement. Youths danced in the streets in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and firecrackers rounded through <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. A 25-year-old man wounded in the head three days ago in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> died Wednesday, raising to 313 the number of Palestinians killed in the nearly year-long uprising against 21 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Eleven Israelis also have died. Also in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, military appeals court rejected appeals of eight <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> activists slated for deportation but upheld two other appeals conditional on approval of military officials, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. It said the eight planned to appeal to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Since the uprising started, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has deported 33 Palestinians.

<HEAD>Prosecution Changes Charge Against Woman Accused In Newborn's
Abduction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The state dropped a kidnapping charge against a woman who now stands accused of `` permanent detention or restraint'' in the abduction of a newborn boy from his mother's hospital room After the change in the charge Wednesday, <PERSON> Acqunetta </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 32, entered two pleas: innocent and innocent by reason of insanity. Chief Deputy Prosecutor <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he decided to alter the charge against Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> because of the alleged purpose of the crime. Kidnapping is an abduction for the purpose of holding someone for a ransom, as a hostage, or to hurt the victim. Permanent detention is holding or concealing a person `` without ever releasing him, without ever returning him to the person or institution from whose lawful custody he was taken.'' King contended Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> wanted to raise the infant she is accused of abducting. Kidnapping and permanent detention carry the same penalty: five to 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 15,000. No bond was set. The innocent plea, according to public defender <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, is standard in criminal cases. He said the plea of innocent by reason of mental disease or defect was made so that Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> could be evaluated by psychiatrists. Among the issues to be settled is whether Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is mentally capable of standing trial. She was denied bond Tuesday after she entered an innocent plea on the kidnapping charge in Little Rock Municipal Court. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was arrested at her <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> home Monday after police received a tip from an anonymous caller that she had taken the baby, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The child was taken Nov. 1 from his mother's hospital room, three days after he was born six weeks premature, by a woman disguised as a nurse. The boy was returned to his parents, <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas-Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, in good health. Authorities said the infant was well taken care of during the two weeks he was missing. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and her boyfriend wanted to have a baby boy, said Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A registered nurse at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> medical school hospital recalled during a Wednesday interview that Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was a caring person who tended to her terminally ill sister for two years before she died. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON>, the assistant head nurse of the hospital's clinic, said Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s sister died early this year Mrs. <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> would not reveal the woman's illness. `` She could have deserted her sister,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> said. `` A lot of patients that come in here that have a very bad illness, their families just totally turn on them. She could have done that easily but she did n't.'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, divorced with four children of her own, cares for her sister's child.

<TEXT>
 About 50 people claimed victory today and ended a five-day fast aimed at forcing officials to rehire the last of about 100 workers dismissed for roles in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s worst labor unrest in seven years. Agreement was reached through the mediation of the Roman Catholic bishop in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON>, a spokesman for the fasters protesting since Saturday in the Christ the King Cathedral in the southern city. `` We managed to achieve in five days what had n't been achieved in several months,'' said <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON>, speaking by telephone from the cathedral. The nation's bishops and <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, leader of the banned Solidarity independent labor movement, had appealed for the miners' reinstatement The opposition said rehiring them was a condition for participating in talks with the government. <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON> said agreement was reached late Wednesday with the national coal federation to reinstate the workers today. The strikes were in August. Bishop <PERSON> Damian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimon </PERSON> led a delegation that met with provincial officials on Tuesday, <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON> said, adding that two more negotiating sessions Wednesday led to the agreement. He said the workers won job reinstatements for all the dismissed workers except two workers at the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> steel mill in the southeast. The church will continue to mediate in that case, he said. <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Napieracz </PERSON>, a deputy director at the coal federation, the body that oversees the mines, said, `` The miners are returning to their old posts as of tomorrow.'' He denied they ever had been fired and said officials had wanted to to give them new positions, while the miners insisted on their old jobs. Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that the the decision `` should have been mede several months ago. Let us hope other positive signs will follow.'' The hunger protest began early Saturday after a pro-independence march Friday night turned violent. Organizers say about 250 people took shelter from police inside the cathedral in <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>, about 170 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. At the urging of one miner, about 80 of the people began a hunger strike, originally aimed at winning freedom for detained fellow demonstrators. But after those demonstrators were freed, the fasters decided to adopt the cause of the fired miners. <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Polmanski </PERSON>, whom authorities have said is a ringleader of the August strike at the <LOCATION> Andaluzja </LOCATION> coal mine, said the fasters included 16 dismissed miners. Students and various opposition activists comprised the rest. The opposition originally counted 103 workers as fired or drafted into the army for joining the August strikes for higher pay and legalization of Solidarity, he said. The number of those still not rehired had fallen to 49 miners and the two steelworkers by this week, he said. <PERSON> Polmanski </PERSON> said the issue was broader than individual jobs. If authorities succeeded in firing strike leaders, it would make workers less willing to fight for their rights in the future, he said. The question also became a stumbling block to talks between the opposition and authorities on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future and the legalization of Solidarity, which was crushed in a 1981 military crackdown. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> agreed to end the August strikes after the government agreed to the talks. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said he will not come to the table until officials honor a promise by Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> at the end of August that strikers would not be fired. Also blocking the talks is the government's objection to two longtime Solidarity activists <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has refused to remove from the opposition delegation _ <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>. Solidarity also has insisted that the government reverse its decision to close the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where Solidarity was born in an August 1980 strike wave. On Wednesday, the Episcopate Secretariat, which represents <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> nationwide, criticized plans to close the shipyard and said it was `` a political act not facilitating reconciliation.''

The shooting at the auto dealership came next, followed by the gasoline station robbery in <LOCATION> Belvidere </LOCATION> about 2:15 a.m., in which no one was hurt, police said. After the robbery, <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON>'s car was pulled over in <LOCATION> Belvidere </LOCATION> by a local officer, but after backup police arrived, the suspect led them on a 20-mile chase, said <ORGANIZATION> Belvidere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhart </PERSON>.

 This country is n't going to the dogs. In fact, more Americans now consider a cat the `` purr-fect'' pet, and birds are soaring in popularity. For the first time ever, cats are more popular with American pet owners, apparently because of the advent of the yuppie, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. `` With more and more apartment living, a cat is just a better pet to own. A dog needs a lot of attention. A person has to hurry from work to walk a dog,'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavzer </PERSON>, marketing director for the <ORGANIZATION> AVMA </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cat population reached an estimated 54.6 million at the end of 1987, compared with 52.4 million dogs, according to a study of 40,000 households by <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kan </PERSON>. Birds are moving up in the rankings faster than any other creature. The number of pet birds rose 24 percent, from 10.4 million to 12.9 million, between 1983, when a previous survey was taken, and the new study. `` A bird is even more of a yuppie pet,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> AVMA </ORGANIZATION> veterinarian. `` The big birds are not cheap. The more exotic ones cost thousands of dollars.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cat population increased 4.6 percent and the dog population declined 5.8 percent between the two studies, said the <ORGANIZATION> AVMA </ORGANIZATION>, based in suburban <LOCATION> Schaumburg </LOCATION>. `` People used to get a cat or bird until they could get a ` real' pet, but people are finding out that cats and birds are real pets,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> `` Some of the big, exotic birds live 60 or 70 years, bringing pleasure to two or three generations of one family,'' she said. The total number of cats, dogs, birds and horses kept by Americans increased less than 1 percent to 126 million. When hamsters, fish, turtles, snakes and rabbits are counted, the total climbs to more than 200 million creatures _ closing in on the nation's human population of 245 million as of last January. The typical pet owner, researchers said, is a large family with children living outside a metropolitan area, with an above-average income and more than one pet. They also found that people in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> and Southern states keep more pets. The leading cat-owning states are <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the study indicated. Dogs are tops in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.

 Doctors pumped nearly two pounds of cocaine in tiny rubber bags from the stomach of a pregnant woman arrested along with three men trying to smuggle the drug in their bodies, Customs agents said. `` This is a new low, when a pregnant woman will put cocaine in her body and risk not only her own life but the life of her unborn child,'' said Customs spokesman <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>. The four Colombians were arrested at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Sunday, charged with smuggling 427 bags containing more than eight pounds of cocaine, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, another Customs spokesman. The practice of smuggling cocaine by swallowing it is not uncommon. The men were allowed to pass the cocaine at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>; doctors pumped the stomach of the woman, <PERSON> Iveth </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocha </PERSON>, 22, <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> said. `` It is possible, and it has happened here in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, for a persons' digestive juices to eat through the rubber and release the cocaine into the stomach,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Capps </PERSON>, Customs chief of airport operations in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` If that happens, that person is dead in a matter of minutes.'' `` A lot of time these people, ` mules,' are peasants really, from very low levels of society,'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> added. `` In many cases they may be ignorant of the dangers.''

 A Cessna-441 crashed in heavy fog today in lagoons west of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, killing at least seven people, some of them journalists, officials said. Rescue workers went immediately to the site of the crash, the Saclay lagoons on the edge of the <LOCATION> Essonne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yvelines </LOCATION> districts outside <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Local officials and rescue workers said the pilot and six passengers, some of them reporters, were killed in the 10:30 a.m. crash. The cause was not immediately known. The flight roster listed 10 people, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Direction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>. However, police and <ORGANIZATION> Essonne </ORGANIZATION> officials believed some scheduled passengers failed to board the plane. They said there appeared to be no survivors in the debris scattered 150 meters around the crash site. The plane took off in heavy fog from the Toussus-le-Noble airport in the <LOCATION> Yvelines </LOCATION> and was headed for <LOCATION> Montlucon </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, authorities said. The Air and <ORGANIZATION> Frontier </ORGANIZATION> police said the aircraft apparently lost radio contact with the control tower shortly after take-off. The flight was organized in part by Garages du Bac, a BMW dealership in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, to take journalists to a factory and watch test drives of a new model car. <PERSON> Jean-Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Delesalle </PERSON>, a reporter with the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> du <PERSON> Dimanche </PERSON> said he was among those who missed the flight.

<TEXT>
 The spokeswoman for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential transition team today answered warnings from the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> about the deficit by saying that `` economists never agree on anything.'' <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> also said in a television interview that President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first appointments to his economic team have sent a `` very clear signal'' to investors that `` by and large helped calm the markets.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides have been scrambling to ease fears about the deficit, and concerns about the vice president's pledge not to raise taxes, which have sent stocks tumbling at home and put the already-weak dollar into a further tailspin in international markets. The dollar fell today to a 15-year low against the Japanese yen despite reported central bank intervention in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The Dow fell more than 38 points Wednesday and had dropped almost 90 points to a 2 -LCB- - month low since last week's election <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> added the strongest voice yet to calls for action on the deficit, telling a national commission Wednesday the red ink `` already has begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength. And the need to deal with it is becoming ever more urgent.'' <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> post by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, addressed questions of a possible tax increase by saying how the deficit is reduced `` is far less relevant than that it is done.'' Asked on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' about his warning, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said: `` Economists never agree on anything. For every economist you cite we can trot out one who is diametrically in opposition.'' Asked whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president would be at odds with <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said: `` It's traditional economists simply do n't agree with each other. And there's a lot of jockeying going on right now. We just have to wait and see what President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> decides to do.'' `` There's a lot of talk now swirling about the deficit,'' she said. `` I think his appointment of -LRB- Treasury Secretary -RRB- <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> gave a very clear signal as to the kind of administration he's going to have and I think by and large helped calm the markets. Investors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad have attributed some of the bad economic news to strong campaign statement of `` Read my lips _ no new taxes.'' `` I think it's that traditional nervousness with change,'' <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said of the market plunge. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- has said time and time again he wants to meet with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. He's expressed conciliatory gestures. ... I think they'll work together to deal with the issue,'' she said <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> was one of several witnesses who told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is studying how to deal with the deficit, that the problem has been too long ignored. `` This country is imperiled and it is going to take a whole lot of guts to face this fact and deal with it,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, who was Labor Secretary under <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> chief testified that the deficit is more likely to be cut permanently through spending cuts rather than tax increases because congressmen tend to spend new revenues from taxes. But he added that any long-range plan would help lower interest rates `` regardless of its components.''

 <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s fights continued to take place outside the ring as <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, his estranged wife, filed a $ 125 million libel suit against the heavyweight champion. In the lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court, the 23-year-old actress, who appears in the TV show `` Head of the Class,'' accused <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> of holding her up `` to public contempt, ridicule, embarrassment disgrace and prejudice'' for remarks he made that were quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Last month, <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> had announced that she would not seek or accept any money in her divorce from <LOCATION> Tyson </LOCATION>. Among Tyson's quotations in the Post article that angered <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>: _ `` She manipulated me. ... Now it turns out she was lying when she said she did n't want anything from me.'' _ `` The nature of those two women -LRB- <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> and her mother, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> -RRB- is to be mean and vindictive. She said she wants nothing, but she refused to sign a release.'' _ `` And she -LRB- <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> -RRB- stole money from me when we were together.'' The Post was not named as a defendant in the lawsuit, which described the article as `` false, defamatory, malicious and libelous.'' The newspaper had no immediate comment. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, married Feb. 7, have both filed for divorce and he is also seeking an annulment. He is suing her in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and she is suing him in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` I think it's funny,'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s manager, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cayton </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` The lawsuit is outrageous and ludicrous,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s lawyer, said. `` This young lady once again is atempting to shift blame from her conduct to someone else and blame them for any problems she perceives she's having.'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> has accused <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> of mistreating her during their brief marriage. He has also accused her of tricking him into marriage by feigning pregnancy.

<HEAD>Fiji Cabinet Suspends Internal Security Decree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today lifted laws that had given the military and police wide powers of arrest and limited press and personal freedoms. The decree had been in effect since June, following the discovery of illegally imported weapons, including automatic rifles from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, hand grenades and ammunition. In a statement tonight, Information Minister <PERSON> Ratu </PERSON> <PERSON> Imoke </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubuaeola </PERSON> said the Internal Security Decree was intended to close gaps in existing laws to ensure security in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> nation, which has experienced two coups in 1 -LCB- years. The decree limited freedom of movement and expression and allowed searches and detentions without charges being filed. `` Now that most of the illegal arms have been recovered and greater peace and stability exists in the country, it was the view of Cabinet that the time was right for the ISD to be suspended,'' <PERSON> Kubuaeoloa </PERSON> said after a Cabinet meeting. At the same time, the government deployed troops outside government buildings and the capital's two radio stations. It was not clear if that was related to the lifting of the security decree. The soldiers were not carrying arms. Military Forces spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Eroni </PERSON> <PERSON> Volavola </PERSON> described the deployment as `` a normal and regular security exercise.'' About 30 soldiers were posted outside state-run Radio <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> and the private commercial radio station FM-96; a building housing the offices of ministers of the interim government; and electricity and water installations. <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> has a population of about 715,000, of which native Fijians comprise 47 percent. Indians, descendants of British imported sugar plantation labor in the 19th century, make up 49 percent of the population. On May 14, 1987, <PERSON> Sitiveni </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> led armed soldiers into <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and arrested the month-old Indian-dominated government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Timoci </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavadra </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> led a second coup Sept. 25, saying the rights of the minority ethnic Fijians remained threatened. He broke the nation's ties with the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> in October by declaring <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> a republic. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> later handed power to an interim government, headed by <PERSON> Ratu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamisese </PERSON> <PERSON> Mara </PERSON>, while a new constitution was drafted to ensure Fijians have permanent and dominant control in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Rabuka </PERSON> elevated himself to chief of the army and home affairs minister.

<HEAD>Treasury Group Considering Plan to Rescue Savings and Loan System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> staff group is considering a plan using taxpayer money to rescue the ailing savings and loan system in return for direct administration supervision of the bailout, an administration official says. The administration would prefer some sort of off-budget financing for the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L cleanup, but `` they're convinced one way or another that the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> has to participate,'' the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, said Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s advisers are `` very seriously'' looking at creating a presidential panel to control rescue expenditures. In thrift rescues to date, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, has been criticized for making open-ended guarantees to private investors taking over failed institutions and for not requiring the investors to risk more of their own money. <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> said the structure of the new board would be similar to the one created this year to oversee the bailout of the Farm Credit System. The administration official confirmed that the option was being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> staff, but said, `` I do n't think they've reached any conclusions yet. `` Essentially it says, ` We'll give you the money, but we want some control','' the official said. In the rescue of the Farm Credit System, which provides loans to farmers, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guaranteed the system's borrowing and provided a line of credit to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. However, it required that a three-member panel including the secretaries of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and agriculture approve bailout expenditures. The official also confirmed a report published Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which said the administration plan would require $ 20 billion to $ 30 billion a year for three years. An acknowledgment that taxpayer money is required would represent a shift in policy. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> board Chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> has maintained that the savings industry could continue to pay for rescuing failed institutions, although only if a special fee on healthy institutions continued for 30 years. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> has said there is a limit to what the industry can pay but he has not said yet if the problem exceeds it. <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> did not return a telephone call seeking comment Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> declined to comment on the task force's work. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, a bank board spokesman, said <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> was traveling and could not be reached immediately. The savings and loan crisis is shaping up as one of the chief challenges facing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The bank board estimates it will cost up to $ 50 billion to close or merge failed institutions. Private analysts put the cost as high as $ 100 billion. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which insures commercial banks, S & amp; L losses are growing at a rate of $ 15 billion a year. The need for potentially huge expenditures comes at a time when foreign investors, who buy much of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's debt, are demanding that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who pledged not to raise taxes, reduce the budget deficit. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> task force formulating the administration's position is looking to complete its work next month. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who will continue in his position in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, ordered the review shortly after taking office in September. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> business school professor who was staff director for the stock market crash study that <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> conducted last year for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, heads the task force.

<HEAD>2,000 Gallons of Radioactive Water Spill At Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 2,000 gallons of radioactive water overflowed a collection area during maintenance at the <LOCATION> Pilgrim </LOCATION> nuclear plant, and some of it seeped outdoors into a parking lot, the plant's owner said. One worker was slightly contaminated. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' chief aide on nuclear power, said elevated levels of radioactivity were detected as far away as the perimeter fence. He gave no indication of whether the spill posed a threat to the public. The spill occurred Wednesday at a low-level nuclear waste processing area at the plant, which is awaiting word from the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on whether it can begin low-level power testing after a 2 -LCB- - year shutdown About 100 gallons seeped outside the processing facility and onto an asphalt truck parking lot, <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. The water inside and out was mopped up, she said. <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the commission may call in a special inspector to investigate. `` The normal routine follow-up would be by the resident inspectors,'' he said. `` But with all of the attention focusing on Pilgrim, we ca n't rule out the possibility that something else will happen -LRB- such as -RRB- sending a specialist to look at this.'' The plant has been closed because of management and equipment problems. <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON>, assistant secretary of public safety, said he sent a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> team to report on the cleanup and get information on what caused the spill. `` Since we are speaking about a substantial amount of waste water and an exposure that at least resulted in elevated readings as far out as the perimeter, it's a significant event,'' <PERSON> Agnes </PERSON> said. The accident happened in a waste processing area during preparations for shipping a container of waste from the plant. The water was being filtered through earth to remove radioactivity. The earth was to be shipped to a storage facility in <LOCATION> Barnwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. A plant operator making a tour of the plant discovered that the water had overflowed and immediately cut off the water, she said. The worker's knee touched some water during the cleanup and was washed with soap and water, <PERSON> Edison </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> said. `` The level of contamination on his knee was just barely above the minimum level where we say something is contaminated instead of clean,'' <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> said. He said the plant has roped off and is testing the area around the spill.

 A former insurance agent accused of bilking policyholders of $ 590,000 disappeared after renting a small plane, and officials failed to locate him after a two-week search of a lake bottom. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Underwriters </ORGANIZATION> called off its search at a recreational lake for <PERSON> Blan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and the single-engine plane he was flying, said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, a claims manager with the company, which had a policy on the plane. `` It's really difficult,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said of the hunt, which for three days was aided by a $ 1,500-a-day sonar device. `` The terrain under there is so rough. It's like finding a needle in a haystack.'' <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a 45-year-old former agent with <ORGANIZATION> Travelers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, disappeared Oct. 31 while en route from <LOCATION> Vero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, flying into blustery weather to the north. Some of those involved in the search speculated that <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> ditched the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cherokee </ORGANIZATION> or staged a crash and his death to escape having to stand trial on charges of theft by deception that could bring up to 100 years in prison. `` If he's not at the bottom of that lake, he's a fugitive from justice,'' said <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>, an assistant state attorney general who built the case that led to <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>'s indictment in August. Others said he might have crashed intentionally to let his wife and business collect on numerous life insurance policies that prosecutors said totaled some $ 3 million. `` The whole circumstances are mighty unusual,'' said <PERSON> Bump </PERSON> <PERSON> Holman </PERSON>, vice president of the <LOCATION> Vero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, company that rented the plane to <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. The pilot's brother, <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, said divers and others would return to <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> for a last time today, with the family footing the bill. After that, a reward will be offered to lure salvagers, he said. `` I'm convinced it's in the lake somewhere,'' he said. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, who was at the helm of a search boat Wednesday, said his brother had acknowledged the thefts and repaid some $ 400,000. He said his brother never would try to escape justice by faking his death. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> surrendered his insurance license earlier this year. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said pieces of airplane wheels have been found in the search area, and one resident reported hearing an airplane with engine trouble and what sounded like an explosion the night <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> disappeared. `` We're convinced it's in the lake,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> said. `` I think it hit the water, tore off the gear and sank.''

 Police captured two escaped murderers today after an officer became suspicious when a car bearing the seal of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> corrections department drove through town about 2 a.m., authorities said. <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakes </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> Dickie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wimmer </PERSON>, 36, escaped from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Moundsville </LOCATION> on Wednesday by crashing a maintenance truck and a prison car through a gate. The two worked in the prison motor pool. They were captured without incident about 400 miles away. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Patrolman <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> radioed the prison car's license number to a dispatcher this morning because the car seemed out of place in this town. When the report came back that the vehicle was being sought in an escape, <PERSON> Osborne </PERSON> called for backup and the town's two other officers responded. A spokesman at the penitentiary said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> authorities were awaiting word on how the inmates will be returned. <LOCATION> Moundsville </LOCATION> Warden <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON> said the escape occurred early Wednesday when an inmate crashed a gate in a stolen maintenance truck and was followed by the second pirsoner in the car. The truck was abandoned a short distance away. The motor pool is outside the 122-year-old prison's stone walls but surrounded by a chain-link fence, <PERSON> Hedrick </PERSON> said. Rakes is serving a life sentence without parole for the 1980 robbery-murder of a 74-year-old man. <PERSON> Wimmer </PERSON> is serving two life sentences, one without parole, for the 1979 slayings of his estranged wife and their two children.

<TEXT>
 A liquid diet like the one that shaved 67 pounds off talk-show host <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> should be attempted only by certain people, after conventional diets fail and under a physician's supervision, dietitians say After <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> discussed her four-month slimdown Tuesday on her show, about 5,000 telephone calls an hour began to pour into <ORGANIZATION> Sandoz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which sells the Optifast diet program she used, said company spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>. The Optifast program is offered to the public only by hospitals and physicians, <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said. But liquid diet programs `` were not made for the majority of dieters who want to lose 10 or 15 pounds,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chin </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> consulting dietitian and spokesperson for the American <ORGANIZATION> Dietetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Such programs generally should be considered only by people who exceed their ideal weight by at least 20 percent or who face a medical risk because of their weight, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. Liquid diets also should be tried only if conventional diets fail, she said Wednesday. People also should avoid liquid diets if they are pregnant or have kidney or liver diseases, cancer or a recent heart attack, she said. Chin also listed diabetics who requires insulin, but <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON>, assistant director of nutrition services at the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION>, said she considered diabetics potentially eligible after a thorough evaluation. Chin and <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> warned against buying liquid diet products at stores and using them without medical supervision. For one thing, liquid diets provide essentially a starvation diet of 800 calories a day or fewer, and that can cause medical harm unless the symptoms of excessive calorie deprivation are spotted early, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. For example, such a diet can cause muscle wasting as well as mineral imbalances that can lead to heart malfunctioning, she said. Medical supervision also helps in dealing with side effects of the diets, which can include dizziness, constipation, dry skin, hair loss and intolerance to cold temperatures, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. In addition, <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> said, people who follow a liquid diet without supervision may not realize they have such conditions as kidney disease that mean they should avoid such diets. And people who do the diets on their own tend to regain the weight they lost once they return to solid food, <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> said. They miss a key component of supervised liquid diet programs: a maintenance program that teaches how to keep the weight off, she said. Maintenance programs stress the importance of exercise and changing behavior that led to the excess weight, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON>, on her show, pointed out that `` the fact that she lost the weight does n't mean she can keep it off without exercise,'' <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. Apart from looking for medical supervision and a maintenance program that will allow significant individual attention, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kovach </PERSON> offered these tips for choosing a liquid diet program: _ Make sure the diet provides high-quality protein, which includes the eight essential amino acids, and that it fulfills the recommended dietary allowances for vitamins, minerals and protein The protein will be high quality if it is from an animal source, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. _ Besides a physician, the program should include a nutritionist, an exercise physiologist and a behavioral counselor to help keep weight off _ Ask about long-term success rates One program says that after 2.5 years, 18 percent to 41 percent of dieters keep off the weight they lost, which is a `` significant success rate,'' <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> said. If the program offers no statistics, she said, `` I'd look at another program.'' _ Look for an incentive to keep dieters in the program, such as prizes or other rewards for weight loss

 <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s rough-and-tumble City Council has passed a measure designed to curb sexual, racial or ethnic insults during committee hearings. The measure passed 25-18 Wednesday despite objections from several aldermen that it would restrict their rights in questioning mayoral appointees or witnesses. The resolution was introduced by Alderwoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Osterman </PERSON> in reaction to what she felt were irrelevant and inappropriate questions of witnesses. The resolution says religious beliefs, gender and heritage `` shall be considered irrelevant and inappropriate considerations in the decisions regarding appointment, confirmations or eligibility to present testimony.'' <PERSON> Alderman </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> insisted that the measure would infringe on the council's `` right to be vigilant and protect the public interest,'' in addition to barring questioning of membership in such groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> was accused last month by a Jewish organization of `` Jew-baiting'' during a committee hearing, a charge he denied. <PERSON> Osterman </PERSON> insisted the measure was not designed to stifle responsible questioning.

 A <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> portrait of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> that sold in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for $ 497,000 was sold in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> five months earlier for only $ 3,300 because of questions about its authenticity, says a report published today. The painting of the president in a dark blue coat and white neck cloth sold Wednesday for more than five times its top estimate. Both <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which auctioned the painting Wednesday, and <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s East in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which auctioned it earlier this year, said they had asked <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadik </PERSON>, an expert on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> portraits, about the painting's authenticity and had based their descriptions on his opinion, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Sadik </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portrait </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and now a consultant and art dealer in <LOCATION> Falmouth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, told the Times he had seen only photographs of the painting. He also said he was not paid for the opinions he had given. A Christie's spokeswoman, <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneker </PERSON>, said the work had been consigned in 1987 as a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> painting in the style of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>. She declined to identify the painting's owner. <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Force </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s specialist in American paintings, said she showed the actual painting to <PERSON> Sadik </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last November or December because of doubts about its authenticty and <PERSON> Sadik </PERSON> said it was not by <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, the Times said. But <PERSON> Sadik </PERSON> said he could not recall seeing the painting. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, specialist in British paintings at <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that a Briton purchased the painting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, brought it to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and `` recognized what the painting was.'' It was auctioned as a Stuart painting. The painting was purchased Wednesday by the Berry-Hill Gallery of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who conducted the auction, said it had belonged to President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Madison </PERSON> and had hung in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> home.

 The Kremlin today said it was calling Estonian leaders to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to discuss the tiny <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s challenge to central Soviet control. The first official reaction to the vote of the Estonian Supreme Soviet on Wednesday was announced by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency while the parliament in a second Baltic republic, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, was meeting to consider similar action. Estonian legislators passed an amendment to their own constitution Wednesday requiring local ratification of new Soviet laws. `` Taking into consideration that the amendment and a number of other documents adopted by the Estonian parliament are at variance with provisions of the current Constitution ... the Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> Soviet has decided to consider the above-mentioned issue at its next meeting, with representatives of the Estonian republic to be invited,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The tone of the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> statement was measured and appeared to stop short of an outright declaration that the Estonian parliament's action was unconstitutional It did not say when the meeting would take place, but presumably it would be called before the next full meeting of the 1,500-member national Supreme Soviet, which is scheduled for Nov. 29. Estonian officials were called to a meeting with President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the Presidium on Nov. 9. Kremlin officials listened, but did not support their demands for greater autonomy. Two days later Politburo members were sent to <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and the third Baltic republic, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, to preach restraint. Baltic residents are angry about proposed amendments to the national constitution that they say takes away the republics' right to secede and further strengthen central control rather than encouraging the local control that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stresses is necessary for his reform movement to succeed. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> announced that Lithuanian Supreme Soviet had begun its meeting in the capital of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, where it was expected to take up legislation similar to that passed in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. The vote of 258-1, with five abstentions, on the declaration of sovereignty in all areas except foreign and defense policy followed a restrained, serious debate in the Estonian Supreme Soviet. The declaration calls for a treaty with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that would `` determine the further status of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> in the composition of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' In 1940, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> annexed the Baltic republics, which have looked toward the West and rankled under Soviet control. Proponents of the Estonian action said it was consistent with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s calls for greater democratization and local control, and with ritual declarations of autonomy for the republics contained in the Soviet constitution. <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristen </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationalist mass movement, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might be angry at first. `` But when he thinks deeply, he'll think we've supported perestroika more deeply than he expected. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> could have expected worse,'' she said in an interview. Perestroika refers to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s plans for reforming the Soviet economy and society The debate was televised from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>'s 18th century Toompea Palace. Another approved amendments subjects new Soviet laws to local control. If the Presidium, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s top executive body, were to reject a Soviet law that law would not take effect until the next meeting of the republic's Supreme Soviet, said <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Grazin </PERSON>, a law professor who wrote the amemdment. If the parliament also rejects the law, it would be declared void in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, he said. The other four amendments add human and civil rights guarantees and guarantee the right to hold private property. The passage of such measures by a government body is an unprecedented act that defies central authorities in a country still feeling its way through <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness. The Estonian parliament also called unanimously for changes in proposed amendments to the Soviet constitution to lessen the shift in power from the 15 Soviet republics to the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, and to retain the republics' right to secede. The Soviet amendments, which would remove the republics' right to secede, are scheduled for adoption Nov. 29. Estonian radio reported that 2.6 million people in the three republics have signed petitions opposing the Soviet amendments. That would represent nearly a third of the republics' combined population a of 7.7 million. Estonian activists' strategy rests on the traditional claim of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to be a federation of independent republics.

 A judge today acquitted three people but said others in a trial involving leaders of the nation's largest anti-apartheid group committed treason during township uprisings, a crime punishable by death The judgment by <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Kees </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> means some of the 16 remaining defendants could face the death penalty. The decision summed up a 3 -LCB- - year trial involving members of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> who were charged with treason, terrorism, murder and subversion <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON>, in the third day of reading his 1,521-page judgment, did not say which defendants were guilty of treason. The verdicts against individual defendants might not be announced until next week. All the defendants pleaded innocent to the charges, which related to allegations the anti-apartheid front and its affiliates sought to promote violence during unrest in black townships in 1984. The three most prominent defendants are senior front leaders who were denied bail throughout the trial and have spent 40 months in jail. They are <PERSON> Popo </PERSON> <PERSON> Molefe </PERSON>, 36, who was the group's national secretary; <PERSON> Terror </PERSON> <PERSON> Lekota </PERSON>, 40, who was its publicity secretary; and <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, 40, who was secretary of its <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> branch. Those acquitted today were the Rev. <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Motselane </PERSON>, 41; <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlomuka </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baleka </PERSON>, 29. Unlike most of the defendants, they were not closely linked in testimony to the front or to the first wave of unrest in an area called the Vaal Triangle. The group was formed in 1983 to mobilize opposition to a new constitution that created a three-chamber <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> with representation for every group except the black majority. The group is now banned. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> said that because violence was a necessary, intended part of the uprising in the townships, the state had proved the crime of treason. The charges of murder, which also carry a possible death penalty, relate to the mob killings of black town council members during the outbreak of the unrest in the townships south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> noted that the violence began after President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> took the oath of office under the new constitution and the tricameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was announced Sept. 2, 1984. He acknowledged that many people joined the anti-apartheid front because they were disenchanted with the government, but said many had `` closed their eyes,'' not wanting to know that their aspirations for peaceful change could lead to revolt. Since the trial began, most of the front leaders who are not in detention or in hiding have been restricted to their homes and prohibited from making speeches, being quoted or participating in any political activity. Before its banning in February, the front was the largest opposition group in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s history, encompassing more than 600 affiliated groups with about 2 million members. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> said he agreed with prosecutors that the front was supported and guided by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest guerrilla movement fighting <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-led government. The front has maintained that it endorsed the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s political goals, such as a one-person, one-vote system, but did not approve of violence. Originally, there were 22 defendants in the trial. Three other men were acquitted in 1986. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> has presided over the non-jury trial since its start in June 1985 and has sole responsibility for the verdict and sentencing. Under apartheid, the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

 The government today banned a white supremacist group after a self-proclaimed white racist was charged with shooting to death six blacks during a casual walk through <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, 23, was ordered to undergo treatment at a psychiatric hospital after a court hearing, in which he appeared in khaki clothes and leg irons. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, a former policeman, smiled throughout the hearing before Magistrate <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. He said he had no desire to cooperate with the court. Later, the government banned the small <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the first time such action has been taken against a right-wing group. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> has been linked to two extremist organizations, including the large <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, but not to the White Liberation Movement. Both groups have swastika-type symbols and have expressed sympathy for the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> imposed the ban under national emergency regulations, which have also been used to ban 23 anti-apartheid organizations. He did not explain why the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> in particular was outlawed. The Movement was formed in 1985 but did not come to public notice until 1987. Its leader, <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabort </PERSON>, said it has more than 1,000 members but many more sympathizers. He said the government's action reduced the `` outlet for frustration of white South Africans. ... Now we can not control people who are worried about their race survival. Some of them could organize underground.'' <PERSON> Schabort </PERSON>, a biochemist, said his group supports banishment of all Jewish and Indian <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and removal of all blacks from white urban centers, including the `` clearing out'' of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, home to 2.5 million blacks outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. He said the group does not support violence and added, `` I fully blame the government for what happened in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> on Tuesday.'' `` Whites are living under tremendous pressure and are being undermined by blacks,'' <PERSON> Schabort </PERSON> said. The shooting spree prompted government officials to promise a broad crackdown on white extremists. Dr. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieterse </PERSON>, a court-appointed psychiatrist who examined the suspect, said <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> showed symptoms of being a psychopath and had expressed pride in what he had done. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Weskoppies </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for 30 days of observation and ordered to reappear in court Dec. 19. He was charged with murdering six blacks and attempting to murder 17 as he walked, smiling and laughing, through downtown <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> firing an automatic pistol. Speaking in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> told the court, `` If communists such as -LRB- Anglican Archbishop -RRB- <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and -LRB- former South African ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON> are arrested, then I will cooperate.'' <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> frequently turned to wave at his family in the courtroom, which was packed and guarded by policemen with shotguns. In an unusual move, photographers were allowed inside. <PERSON> Nic </PERSON> <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, a retired policeman who is a member of the movement, and another son were present, wearing business suits. Members of the movement frequently dress in khaki uniforms and wear swastika-type emblems and weapons. Critics of the white minority government frequently have questioned why right-wing white organizations which appear to espouse violence are not banned while anti-apartheid organizations are outlawed. A member of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> raised the question again Wednesday. A government official said an investigation would have to be conducted. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 26 million blacks have not vote in national affairs and the country's 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate residential districts, schools and health services.

 Seals came off the barrels and corks popped all over <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> today after the midnight embargo on consumption of this year's Beaujolais nouveau expired Thousands of Parisians braved the chill of the November night to sip a glass of the wine whose annual export by jet, helicopter, boat and truck to all corners of the world has boosted both image and sales of the French viticulture industry. Outside <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Val </PERSON> d'Or wine bar near the Champs Elysees, two 220-liter barrels of the light red wine, specially chosen by owner <PERSON> Geraud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongier </PERSON>, were emptying fast. `` This year, it's good, very light, very perfumed,'' <PERSON> Rongier </PERSON> said. At other watering holes, waiters like <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribolla </PERSON> said the wine has the same aftertaste and aroma of banana as last year's vintage <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> newspaper described this year's batch of <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON> as `` more nuanced, more subtle and more traditional than last year's.'' Not all the French are seduced by what some maintain is media hype of the annual uncorking meant to bluff foreigners. `` I never drank the stuff before all this started and I still do n't,'' growled one seasoned customer. <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON> distributers work to perfect the near mythic annual arrival of the wine, and some fretted Wednesday as a dock strike held up 230 trucks with the precious cargo bound for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION>. They were rerouted to <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>. `` The paralysis of the port today -LRB- Wednesday -RRB- is a real disaster for business and the image of the Beaujolais,'' said <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravisse </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Calais </LOCATION>. Last year, 8 million bottles of Beaujolais crossed the Channel to invade beer-based English pubs. One German driver bound for Dortmund in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was evidently convinced of the qualities of this year's harvest. He was arrested as his truck laden with 20,000 bottles zigzaged down the highway late Tuesday. The driver, who's name was not released, was banned from driving in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for six months, police said.

 Populist leader <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> defeated her right-wing opponents in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s first free national elections in 11 years and today called on the president to let her form the new government. In Wednesday's balloting, the voters gave `` a mandate for democracy, dignity ... justice and technology,'' the 35-year-old politician told reporters at her family villa in southern <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION> province. The U.S.-educated Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> would be the first woman to lead a Moslem nation if she is chosen to form the government. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> was run by Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> until his death Aug. 17 in a plane crash. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> captured 92 seats in the 237-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, easily outpacing its main rival, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which won 55 seats. Independent candidates and minor parties captured 57 seats. Results from 13 races were not available. The remaining 20 seats will be filled by women chosen by the elected assembly members. Two of the Alliance's three major figures, including former Prime Minister <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, were defeated by People's Party candidates. About 30 political parties fielded candidates, but the campaign boiled down to a race between the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the nine-party <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which includes loyalists of <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> `` should now call upon the <ORGANIZATION> PPP </ORGANIZATION> to form the government,'' which would allow her to recapture the prime ministership her father lost in a 1977 coup. She said the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had already started talking with other left-leaning parties and said forming a governing coalition would not be difficult. The country's Constitution requires <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> to choose a prime minister who will be `` most likely to command the confidence of the majority of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>,'' but he is under no deadline to act. Asked Wednesday whether he would be reluctant to designate a woman as head of government of this male-dominated soceity, <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> replied: `` I think a woman prime minister might be a good change.'' The army pledged had not interfere in Wednesday's balloting and thousands of soldiers and police were deployed for the election, which was largely peaceful. <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, once the undisputed leader of the Alliance-dominating <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, was defeated in his hometown of <LOCATION> Sindhri </LOCATION> by a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate. The chairman of the Alliance and leader of the center-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jatoi </PERSON>, lost to <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates in both districts he contested The Alliance's leading political strongman, <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> chief minister <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, was assured a seat from <LOCATION> Lahore </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, in a show of her personal popularity, won all three seats she was contesting. Candidates could contest more than one seat to improve their chance of election, but must forfeit all but one. The vacant seats are contested later. While she monitored election results, about 5,000 supporters gathered in the streets outside, dancing and chanting, `` <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON>, prime minister.'' Officials reported no major violence or fraud in the nationwide balloting despite widespread fears of disruption. Newspapers today reported three election-related deaths, but the incidents could not be immediately confirmed. The election focused on political personalities. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father was <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, whose government was toppled by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> in 1977. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> had him hanged two years later. She proved a charismatic campaigner, drawing enthusiastic crowds numbering in the tens of thousands throughout the country. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and the Alliance both pledged to continue close ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to support anti-communist guerrillas in neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and to stick to <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s program to make <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> a more Islamic nation. But she said she would not allow the religious policy to harm women's and minorities' rights. Considered very Westernized, she studied at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>. About 48 million of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s 107 million people were eligible to vote and unofficial estimates said slightly more than half voted. Illiterate millions chose their candidates by symbol, and men and women voted separately, in keeping with strict Moslem practice. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled for eight years under martial law before holding national elections in 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party and other opposition groups boycotted those polls, allowing a sweep by candidates who barely hid their ties to the <ORGANIZATION> Muslim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The league formed a government under <PERSON> Junejo </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> abruptly fired the <ORGANIZATION> Junejo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> in May and dissolved the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and dragging their feet on Islamization. Several Muslim League members stayed on in a Zia-appointed caretaker government. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> called Wednesday's elections before he died in a plane crash that also killed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and 28 other people. The cause of the crash has not yet been determined.

 A <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> court today aquitted a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gestapo </ORGANIZATION> chief accused in the deportation of 177 French Jews who died in <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, a court official said. Several French spectators called out `` murder!'' and `` Nazi court!'' after the verdict was read, said court spokeswoman <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakosek-Ruehling </PERSON>. Count Modest <PERSON> Korff </PERSON>, 79, was a Nazi SS captain and served as <ORGANIZATION> Gestapo </ORGANIZATION> chief in the <LOCATION> Chalons-sur-Marne </LOCATION> region in northeastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943. His trial started in September 1987 after an investigation into the deportation and death of 220 Jews from the region under <PERSON> Korff </PERSON>'s control A court spokesman, <PERSON> Freimold </PERSON> <PERSON> Gundlach </PERSON>, said the charges were reduced to cover 177 cases, but he did not know the reason. Ms. <PERSON> Zakosek-Ruehling </PERSON> said the defendant was allowed to live at his <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> home during the trial, which was conducted before two jurors and three judges. <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> worked as a ministerial adviser in the West German Economics Ministry until his retirement in the early 1970s. He was unmasked by French Nazi hunter <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON>. During the trial, <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> claimed he did not know about the extermination of Jews when he was the Gestapo chief. An estimated 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust during the 1933-45 Nazi rule. The court based its acquittal on insufficient evidence, Ms. <PERSON> Zakosek-Ruehling </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. About 70 people crowded into the courtroom to hear the verdict, Ms. <PERSON> Zakosek-Ruehling </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Zakosek-Ruehling </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON>, who attended the proceeding, walked out of the courtroom along with the protesters and there were no arrests.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final budget will propose ending some government programs and switching to a two-year budget cycle, the White House said today. Spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to say what `` low priority programs'' are under consideration to be eliminated. He said the budget would call for no new taxes, would not `` tamper with Social Security'' and would include a defense spending buildup that does more than just keep up with inflation. He said the proposal would meet the deficit reduction of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction act, which would mean reductions of at least $ 32 billion to reduce the fiscal 1989 budget to $ 100 billion. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the budget is aimed at achieving a balanced budget by fiscal 1993. He said the review of agency budgets by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> would be completed this week and the <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> proposals would then be submitted to the agencies, which will have a right of appeal from the budget office decisions before the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> takes the budget proposal to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which has the final say in that it must appropriate money to run the government.

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 10-foot rocket bearing four experiments made a five-minute flight today in what was touted as the first truly private, commercial space flight. The rocket, dwarfed by larger space rockets launched here, burned its motor for only 4.4 seconds as it pushed the payload container to an altitude of about 14,000 feet, or less than three miles. The launch took place at 7:30 a.m. The payload was later recovered from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> even though the main parachute on the rocket failed to open. <ORGANIZATION> E'Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION> hopes the rocket, LOFT-1, will lead to investor interest in the company so that it eventually can buy bigger rockets and establish a commercial launch service. Stockholders and potential investors were among the 200 people who watched the liftoff. Company officials admit they have a long way to go. They had to delay the maiden launch a year to meet financial, safety, technical and government requirements. The so-called `` commercialization of space,'' to bring the private sector into the launching of satellites and other space activity, has been a major goal of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> admininstration. E'Prime paid the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> $ 24,000 for use of an old weather rocket launch pad and some support services. The company also had to buy $ 1 million in liability insurance to cover any damage to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> property. It was the first time a privately owned rocket had been launched from either <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> facilities here. E'Prime operations director <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizell </PERSON> said the experiments on board the flight were from paying customers. He declined to say how much they had paid except to say that it was not enough to make the flight profitable. He estimated the total the fledgling company has spent up to this point at $ 200,000. In trying to attract investors, E'Prime billed the flight as the `` first truly commercial space flight.'' But by <PERSON> E'Prime </PERSON>'s own definition, space starts 75 miles up. And <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a commercial launch company in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, sent up a rocket six years ago, although it did not carry commercial cargo. Though the main chute did not open during the flight, <PERSON> Mizell </PERSON> reported that the smaller parachute broke the fall and divers recovered the floating 30-pound package about two miles offshore. They reported it appeared to be undamaged. LOFT-1, which stands for Launch Operations Flight Test, carried a biology experiment from a <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, high school; a thin-film polymer experiment from <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; a flight monitoring system for measuring acceleration and temperature from <ORGANIZATION> QSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Weber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, and a data collection and telemetry system from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Americans hoping to live tobacco-free were determined to butt out of smoking today in the 12th annual Great American Smokeout as celebrities stressed the message: You're a fool if you think smoking is cool. `` I started smoking at 14 because I thought it was chic,'' said actress <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> <PERSON> Holm </PERSON>, who with other stars at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday urged participation in the smokeout `` I did n't know it would kill you. Now we know better.'' Anti-smokers around the country prepared for the big snuff-out, which attempts to coax puffers to say, `` Enough!'' _ at least for a day. In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, a sheriff said he wanted to `` arrest smoking,'' newborn babies in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and Council Bluffs, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, were adorned with anti-smoking T-shirts and the operator of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline tried to convince people that it's no joke to smoke. `` The Great American Smokout proves that you have freedom of choice to start smoking but you do n't have freedom of choice to stop smoking and by people trying to quit for 24 hours, they realize that they are addicted to a very dangerous drug,'' Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said today on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` They realize that they are addicted to a very dangerous drug and they know it's not a dirty habit that they can kick and they need some professional help.'' New to the smokeout this year is the `` Back a Quitter'' program. Backers act as buddies to the smokers for the day. By soliciting pledges from co-workers for every hour they go without a cigarette, the smokers also will raise funds for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. The American Cancer Society, which sponsors the event, estimated nearly 40 percent of the nation's 50 million smokers participated last year. `` Here's our answer to a pack-a-day _ a pachyderm!'' shouted ringmaster <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as one of two cigarette-smashing elephants stomped a Styrofoam butt to promote the smokeout at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s `` Big Apple Circus.'' `` I bet if you could show people who do n't smoke have a much better sex life, most people would quit today,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Westheimer </PERSON>, the sex therapist who managed a smile despite the elephant trunks swinging over her. `` So let's pretend that's true.'' In <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, Sheriff <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tussing </PERSON>, who lost both of his parents to smoking-related illnesses, said he wanted to put the cuffs on smoking, while employees at <ORGANIZATION> Gibbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> were signing up as quitters and as backers. At <LOCATION> Swedish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Abbi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said newborns at the hospital were going to wear `` I'm a Born Non-Smoker'' T-shirts today. In <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, a three-day lung testing workshop was under way. On Wednesday, the first day of the testing, several hundred people showed up. The operator of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline was putting Great American Smokeout materials at the line's pump stations today, urging people to nix nicotine. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also planned to provide a free lunch for people participating in the stop-smoking event. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, state health officials unveiled a plan Wednesday to counter the appeal of cigarettes to teen-agers and make all state businesses smoke-free, except in designated areas, by 1995. Public Health Commissioner <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Prothrow-Stith </PERSON> said the anti-smoking plan calls for expanded education to inform children about the dangers of tobacco, a mass media campaign to counter more than $ 50 million spent in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> each year on cigarette advertising, a ban on free samples of tobacco products and restrictions on smoking in schools, health facilities and businesses. The <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, officially announced its `` Great American Welcome'' program in newspaper advertisements Tuesday, but a spokesman said that program was not planned as a rebuttal to the smokeout. `` We're not really doing anything to counter the smokeout,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, assistant to the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The institute's program is `` aimed at businesses that believe that smokers and non-smokers are welcome valuable customers to accommodate and who want make your experience with them enjoyable,'' he said. Tuesday's ad invites people to call a toll-free number to find businesses nationwide that are a part of the program. Other celebrities at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> event Wednesday included composer <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlisch </PERSON>, actress <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON>, and current Broadway stars <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alison </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamlisch </PERSON> urged smokers unconcerned about their health to think about their friends and family, citing the recent death of his friend and `` A Chorus Line'' collaborator <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleban </PERSON>. The lyricist, a heavy smoker, died of cancer last December. `` When you lose someone to cancer because of something they can control, it really hurts a lot, because it did n't have to be that way,'' said <PERSON> Hamlisch </PERSON>, who has never smoked. No large events were scheduled in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, in the heart of the nation's largest tobacco-growing region. One year, the <LOCATION> Forsyth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> official of the cancer society set up anti-smoking booths. `` It was very traumatic for the volunteers. ... People came by and blew smoke at them and let them know they were n't welcome,'' said a society spokeswoman who refused to be identified. `` I do n't want to ask them to go through that again.

 The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops concluded their annual meeting today with formal pleas for religious liberty in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and for the easing of a law covering legal status for undocumented Hispanic workers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said the bishops were challenging Soviet leaders, whose policies have heavy influence throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` to match their recent talk of reform with concrete action.'' Despite improvements in some countries, the church leaders said in their statement, `` A general pattern of intolerance of religion remains clearly evident.'' As for Hispanic workers, the bishops said in a separate statement that there is widespread discrimination in this country, partly because employers do n't understand immigration rules concerning whom they can or ca n't hire. The bishops said they are compiling files of discrimination cases in hopes of persuading lawmakers to rewrite the law. One day earlier, the bishops politely but firmly told the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to go back and start over on its document questioning the authority of national bishops conferences such as theirs. And, far from expecting an angry reaction from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, one of the bishops' leaders says he expects <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials to do as the American churchmen are asking. About 100 such conferences around the world were asked to comment on the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> draft, and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that many of them seem to be `` expressing opinions similar to ours.'' In response, the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> will likely work up a new draft, he said, though the bishops are not predicting what it might say. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops voted 205-59 earlier Wednesday _ barely meeting the required two-thirds of the conference's 305 active members _ to reject the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> draft. Before the vote, they softened the tone of their rejection notice considerably. But they stood firm when <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> and several other bishops tried to amend the response even further, so it would merely ask for more work on the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> draft rather than a new start. `` Half a loaf is better than none,'' Law said. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>'s committee of past conference presidents was first to give ground, withdrawing the original version of the bishops' response on Monday, the first day of the church leaders' annual meeting Suddenly gone from the bishops' proposed description of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> draft were such phrases as `` rigid and confusing'' and `` overly defensive and negative.'' Then Wednesday, by voice vote, the bishops deleted these words: `` non placet _ the draft is not suitable.'' Several bishops had argued that the phrase, especially the formal Latin, was too blunt, perhaps even offensive to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Still, the final version says elsewhere, `` We do not believe that the working document is suitable as a basis for discussion.'' The first version had received considerable news coverage, and some bishops have criticized the accounts as too negative. However, Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul-Minneapolis </LOCATION>, a member of <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>'s committee, said, `` They perceived a sharpness in the tone of the document which I do n't think we intended'' and helped spur the bishops to write a better response to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. The American bishops' most controversial efforts _ their national pastoral letters taking issue with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies on nuclear weapons and on treatment of the poor _ have won public praise from Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. However, the rising prominence of such conferences has also brought criticism from <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials, who note that such organizations are not part of the Roman church's traditional hierarchy. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> draft declares that bishops conferences have little real standing, that the church lodges authority in the individual bishops under the pope, the bishop of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops, in their reply, do not lay out a case arguing that the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is wrong. Rather, they argue that the draft distorts some evidence and generally gives only one side of the matter. On another topic, the bishops also voted Wednesday to set guidelines on preaching by lay men and women during <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> masses. Several bishops said the guidelines could lead to more such preaching. But others noted that they reiterated clear strictures against anyone other than an ordained minister preaching the main sermon interpreting the gospel during mass. Retired Bishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McManus </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne-South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bend </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, argued that the guidelines restating that implicit ban on some preaching by women _ who can not be ordained as <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> ministers _ would be an unnecessary new `` source of irritation'' for the denomination's women. He offered what he described as the ridiculous possibility that a local church would have <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> as its guest but could allow her to speak only early in the service or at the very end, leaving the main sermon to a male deacon parroting `` Bible lessons he learned in the second grade.''

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> today indicated that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s demand that its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies shoulder a greater defense burden may run into widespread resentment in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a staunch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supporter, has in recent weeks been emphasizing that the West Germans are not eager to take on greater financial burdens within the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. In a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, an independent body of lawmakers from the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> extended that message somewhat to include other Alliance allies in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` We are all agreed it is not satisfactory to busy ourselves with extensive account ledgers in order to prove our achievements to one another,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said in the keynote speech to the assembly's plenary session. `` I only have to mention that besides the German army, more than 400,000 soldiers of our allies are stationed in this densely populated land,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. But he added, `` We should also not overtax one another and thereby conjure up the danger that acceptance of the alliance could be damaged.'' Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials maintain that West European <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members are not shouldering their fair share of the expense. West Germans argue that other kinds of national contributions to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> besides financial considerations should also be taken into account. They cite as an example putting up with the noise and intrusiveness of military hardware and soldiers on their territory. In his address, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> referred to the `` heavy burden on our people from low-level flights'' by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> pilots based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> called for strengthening the `` European pillar,'' referring to assembly proposals for an exclusively European division of troops. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> can not demand the presence of American troops if it can not provide its own substantial contribution,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. But he added that `` the security of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, also in the future, depends decisively on the American counterbalance'' to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military strength. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> called on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to `` orient its military presence -LRB- in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- on the needs for self-defense'' and for lower conventional-force levels. He referred also to the Soviet bloc's `` drastic superiority ... in the area of nuclear short-range weapons.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should include these weapons in future disarmament negotiations. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also said he rejects removing nuclear weapons completely from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because of the continued numerical superiority of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact forces.

 A former bank employee who admitted embezzling $ 14,000 said she gave part of the money to needy families who were denied bank loans. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Granstaff </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, 21, was placed on five years' probation Wednesday for stealing in 1986-87 from <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, where she was in charge of issuing travelers checks and savings bonds. She pleaded guilty to embezzlement Sept. 9. `` You just ran a private charity, Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District JUdge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` You took from the bank and gave to these families, thinking you were <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>.''

Defense attorney <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> said the gifts constituted a `` substantial'' portion of what she took and that the families needed groceries and clothing. `` It's a commendable trait to want to help people,'' the judge said, `` but you ca n't buy friendships.'' Ms. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> claimed to have stolen about $ 14,000; bank officials said she cost them $ 27,650. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> ordered her to repay $ 19,500. He also ordered her to perform fours hours a week of community service work for a year. `` She took money from what people paid her to buy travelers' checks and savings bonds, destroyed records, turned in falsified amounts to <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> and the bank and simply kept the money,'' said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Goggin </PERSON>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> welcomed today a suggestion by <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> for the opening of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offices in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to gather information about Americans missing in action in the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war. However, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, a press officer, said the senior <LOCATION> Vietnamese </LOCATION> official who announced the proposal had not transmitted it formally to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government during a recent private visit to the country. And the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said Vietnamese government adviser <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> had not met with <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. Even so, Ms. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said, `` the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is prepared to consider any formal proposals that the Vietnamese government may have in resolving this pressing humanitarian problem.'' <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> told reporters Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, that `` we need to get to the bottom of this matter, and I think this is the only way. We let this go on too long for anyone's good.'' He said he had conveyed the proposal from Vietnamese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Co </PERSON> <PERSON> Thach </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and congressmen during his recent trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and found an `` enthusiastic'' response. `` The ball is now in your -LRB- American -RRB- court. You play it,'' <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON> said in response to whether the MIA offices would be opened. <PERSON> Oanh </PERSON>, an economic advisor to Vietnamese leader <PERSON> Nguyen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, said the offices _ set up and manned by Americans _ would gather information on the fates of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen still unaccounted-for from the war. The number of offices and locations would be worked out at a later date, he said. In recent months, stepped-up cooperation between <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the MIA issue has included a joint search in northern <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and the hand-over by <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> Nov. 3 of 23 remains believed to be those of American war dead. More than 2,300 Americans are still listed as MIAs from the wars in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has cited this issue and the Vietnamese military presence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> as key impediments to normalized relations between the onetime foes. Hoping to broaden its international contacts and shore up its devastated economy, <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION> has been seeking diplomatic ties and the lifting of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo.

 A landlady suspected in the deaths of seven tenants whose bodies were unearthed in the yard of her boardinghouse was returned here today, hours after her arrest in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> motel room. <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, 59, accompanied by <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> detectives, arrived in handcuffs at Executive Airport and was taken to the Police Department for questioning. She ignored reporters' questions as she crossed the tarmac `` I have not killed anyone. I told you that. I have not killed anyone. The checks I cashed, yes,'' she told <ORGANIZATION> KCRA-TV </ORGANIZATION> before landing in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. It was not immediately known when she would be arraigned. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> was taken into custody after a five-day hunt Wednesday night by police who tracked her on a tip provided to a TV station. `` She was real cool, real calm. It looked like she almost expected it,'' said Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutzow </PERSON>. Police believe <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> killed tenants of her <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> boarding house for their Social Security benefits. They have a list of two dozen people who are missing and who might have lived at the eight-bedroom house at one time or another. Police tracked her to the Royal Viking Motel on the basis of a tip provided to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> by a disabled pensioner who met her in a bar and took a liking to her, said CBS assignment editor <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutzow </PERSON>, who said the woman identified herself using an alias, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Johansen </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the man who alerted the news media had made a date to go shopping with her today. `` During a lengthy conversation, she told him she was from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> area and he put two-and-two together and called,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutzow </PERSON> said. `` He wanted me to wait until the next day because he had a date with her,'' <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutzow </PERSON> said. The man, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON>, 67, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said today in an interview that he became suspicious after <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> quizzed him about his Social Security benefits. `` She seemed so nice and sincere. She really was very believable,'' <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> said, adding that she also had suggested that they live together. `` I kept looking at the woman. Something just did n't seem right. I felt like I had seen her before,'' he added, explaining why he called the TV station. The white-haired <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, clad in a red jacket and pink house dress, bowed her head as officers walked her to a patrol car. She declined to answer any reporters' questions, but appeared somewhat dazed. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, who has a criminal record dating back to a 1948 conviction for forging checks, has been charged only with the murder of <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, 52, a mentally disabled transient who lived in the house. His disappearance caused Volunteers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> counselor <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Moise </PERSON> to contact police, leading to the diggings. She had not been seen since Saturday, when police allowed her to walk away from the house while they dug for bodies. State and federal authorities had been searching for her in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, where she has relatives, and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. One former tenant, <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, told reporters Wednesday that he and other tenants unknowingly heled Puente dispose of the bodies by digging the makeshift graves. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 74, said <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> first asked him to dig a hole in the back yard for an apricot tree. `` She said she had contacted a nursery and they told her she needed a hole that was four feet by four feet and five feet deep. I thought that was a little deep. Now I know why.'' Digging was completed at the boarding house yard Tuesday and police searched the inside of the blue house. Detectives removed several items from the house, but would not say what evidence was found other than the seven bodies. <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said there has been no decision whether to dig at any other sites, including a house several blocks away where <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> lived several years ago. The coroner's office, assisted by several forensic anthropologists, is still in the process of identifying the bodies and performing autopsies to determine cause of death.

 Negotiators were meeting here today to discuss <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s return of a sorely disputed strip of sand along its border with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. Legal experts from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are seeking to implement a Sept. 29 decision by an international arbitration panel, which ruled that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must give back the 250-acre <LOCATION> Taba </LOCATION> enclave at the northern tip of the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the land when it took the <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war.

<HEAD>Warning Label Would Note Danger of Bleeding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> today proposed new labeling requirements for aspirin that would caution pregnant women against taking the popular pain reliever during the last three months of pregnancy because of the threat of bleeding. It is similar to the warning already required for ibuprofen, a pain reliever introduced in 1974 and marketed under such names as Advil and Nuprin. The aspirin warning would say: `` IMPORTANT: Do not take this product during the last three months of pregnancy unless directed by a doctor. Aspirin taken near the time of delivery may cause bleeding problems in both mother and child.'' In a related move, the agency proposed to expand a warning on acetaminophen products, such as Tylenol and Anacin-3, that alerts consumers to the need for prompt medical attention in the case of overdose even if there are no immediate symtoms. The proposal published in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION> was the first stage in a process that technically could drag out for about a year before the new labeling would be formally required. As a practical matter, however, aspirin manufacturers are likely to start using the labeling earlier because there is little likelihood the requirement will not be made mandatory eventually.

 A boy who hailed a win by the hometown team and another who spoke of the `` quest for knowledge'' were among the first earthlings to try to reach out and touch extraterrestrial beings today via `` space phones.'' Using free phones set up through Saturday in the atrium of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T headquarters, the public will have a chance to communicate with someone who could hear their voice long after they're dead, said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON>. About 30 hours of recorded audio-visual messages will be beamed to outer space by the telephone company's satellite dishes from Thanksgiving to New Year's during the early morning hours when they are n't being used for business. Among the first to send messages were students from <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Clinton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, whose pronouncements to the aliens ranged from the poignant to the silly `` I hope the quest for knowledge lasts forever,'' said <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Varas </PERSON>, 13, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronauts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. He explained later that he was concerned about the damage that drugs are doing to the world. `` I hope ... they do n't get stupid like us.'' Like most of the youngsters, <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> said he believed it's highly probable that someone would see or hear his message. If so, the aliens will receive an up-to-date basketball report from <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, 13. His message: `` I hope you saw the <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> versus the Bullets, because the <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> won.'' <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> said later: `` I do n't think there are UFOs, but maybe there is a life form out there. But it's probably used to its environment, so how could it visit us here on earth?'' <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has 30-meter dishes across the country aimed at communications satellites, and one or two would be realigned to beam the radio waves. `` They're very powerful,'' he said. `` We're gon na crank these up.'' The messages will travel at the speed of light in a straight line until they run into something, <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> said. `` I think it appeals to the imagination _ the idea of hurtling messages at the speed of light,'' he said. `` And, of course, it's free, so if people do n't get a call back they wo n't be upset. The so-called `` space phones'' are not the first high-tech attempt to communicate with possible extraterrestrials. When the Voyager spacecraft was launched in 1977, it carried a digital record of 118 photographs of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, 90 minutes of the world's greatest music and greetings in almost 60 human languages and one whale language. But what is new and exciting about this latest communication effort is that it is the first time non-scientists will send messages into space, <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON> said. The messages are recorded as callers speak for 30 seconds into a microphone while being filmed by a television camera, he said. `` We thought it would be fascinating to find out what people would say if they had a chance to leave a message long after they were gone,'' said <PERSON> Monahan </PERSON>. `` We expect to get some very serious thoughts on life, people's hopes, possibly for the coming year but also for the future of the universe.'' But more earthly concerns about boyfriends and girlfriends are also expected to be popular topics, he said. `` We will send every message we get. We'd only edit out something that might be extremely vulgar.'' The first day of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's `` Call the Universe'' program coincided with the opening of its newest phone center at the company's headquarters and the 25th anniversary of its introduction of push-button phones As part of today's celebration, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, a veteran of the Gemini and Apollo space missions, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a mission specialist on a flight of the space shuttle Challenger, and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mets </ORGANIZATION> pitcher <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> were invited to appear and talk to the long-distance callers.

<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Albanian miners put down their tools and marched to the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> today to protest the resignations of the top two Albanian leaders in the ethnically divided area. The flag-waving procession swept aside a cordon of about 20 riot police on the outskirts of the capital, <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, and ignored pleas by local Communist officials to return to <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION>, 30 miles away. <PERSON> Kacusa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON>, the president of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, announced her resignation during a meeting to discuss personnel changes in the provincial leadership, the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. It must be approved by the party presidium. <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON> said <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> will no longer be a member of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s presidium because of a recent federal decision that prohibits <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members from membership in local party bodies, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, the former provincial party president, is a member of the national party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The two Albanian leaders have been the main target of resignation demands by <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s communist party chief, <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, in his drive to bring <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> under tighter Serbian control. Although administratively part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> enjoys wide autonomy under the constitution adopted under the late <PERSON> Josip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. Serbs claim they are harassed by the Albanian majority. The marching miners carried pictures of Tito. The protest, involving about 4,000, was believed to be the largest by ethnic Albanians since ethnic riots in 1981 left at least nine people dead in <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> meeting, described as crucial by the <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> press, was convened after severe criticism of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s mostly ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> leadership by Serbs. `` Despite having shown considerable initiative in her duties, she has to bear objective responsibility for the situation'' in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, said a statement by <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s leadership, carried by <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> as head of the provincial <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> last year. Seven <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> leaders have stepped down in the past month. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, backed by mass rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of Serbs in recent months, has blamed <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s leadership for ethnic tensions in the province. <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON> said in her opening speech that the provincial leadership `` had to insist with greater determination on preventing'' both Albanian and Serbian nationalism in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. The demands for the replacement of the provincial leadership are based on claims they have been unable to cope with Albanian nationalism that has allegedly been simmering since 1981.

The police car was stolen Nov. 8 while a trooper visited relatives. In the trunk were a grenade launcher, tear gas grenades, a submachine gun, a revolver, two shotguns, ammunition and rappelling hooks and other equipment used to scale buildings. City police found the car about two hours after it was reported missing. Its trunk had been forced open and the weapons were missing.

<TEXT>
 A disease that caused 127 children in a Ukrainian town to lose their hair has been traced to high doses of thallium, a toxic metal probably carried by acid rain, a newspaper reported Thursday. `` Since there are no sources of the discharge of thallium into the environment in <LOCATION> Chernovtsy </LOCATION> and its environs, a conclusion was drawn that the chemical was introduced to the area by acid rains in July,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda said. Despite the conclusion, authorities are continuing to investigate other possible causes for the disease, it reported. A criminal investigation has been initiated, Pravda said, indicating that if individuals were found to be responsible for thallium poisoning, they may face criminal charges. Ten industrial operations have been suspended near <LOCATION> Chernovtsy </LOCATION>, on the Soviet border with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, Pravda said. `` However despite the measures being taken, it is reported that the number of cases of the disease continues to grow,'' it said. The disease was first reported in the Soviet media Nov. 6. On Wednesday, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> said the cause had been traced to thallium, but did not name the source. Thallium is a poisonous mettalic element that resembles lead as is used chiefly in compounds in photoelectric cells or in pesticides. Chernovtsy is far from the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant and the areas downwind of it that suffered from radiation contamination after a 1986 accident. Medical experts called in for the investigation were studying the `` strange selectivity of the ailment which affected mainly weakened children and adolescents with blue eyes and blond hair,'' Pravda said. Pravda said the children not only lost their hair, but many experienced mild neurological disorders `` resulting in irritability and hallucinations.'' The children affected ranged in age from 5 -LCB- months to 14 years. Medical experts believe the disease has no lingering effects and the children's hair will grow back, the reports said. <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> said most of the afflicted children had been taken to hospitals in major <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> cities for special attention. `` However the optimistic forecast has not brought any peace of mind because it is still not clear where the source of infection is,'' <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazetta </ORGANIZATION> said. Some of the possible sources, the weekly said, include a Romanian chemical plant about 40 miles from <LOCATION> Chernovtsy </LOCATION> or fumes from gasoline to which `` tricksters'' have added thallium. All the sick children's families have cars, or live in the area of garages, <ORGANIZATION> Literaturnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazetta </ORGANIZATION> said `` Whatever version will prevail, one thing is already clear: it was the last drop which made the cup of ecological patience overflow,'' the weekly said.

<TEXT>
 The ultra-Orthodox <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> political party has asked Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to create a radio station with exclusively religious programming, a spokesman for the party said Thursday. `` We would like to bring some of the light the Torah gives to the people,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> said. `` Many of our own people do not know the ABCs of Judaism because they are denied by the educational system.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s hardline <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> party has made many concessions to <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> in order to gain the support of the religious party, which controls six seats in the parliament, or Knesset. Chief among them was a promise to amend a law narrowing the definition of who is a Jew. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> was asked to form the government by President <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herzog </PERSON> after his party got 40 seats, compared with 39 for the rival <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in Nov. 1 elections for the 120-seat parliament. But negotiations to form a coaltion still are continuing. The Shas party, which represents Sephardic Jews _ those of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> origin _ also has requested the creation of a third, separate school system to be devoted to educating Orthodox Sephardic students. The financially strapped, state-financed school system already supports both secular and religious school systems. <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> has not received definite answers about the radio station or the school system. The Hadashot newspaper said last week that <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> would transform <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s only classical music program into a religious station. There are three state-run radio stations, and an additional station run by the armed forces. The proposed radio station would broadcast courses on Judaism and be used to counter attacks <PERSON> Peretz </PERSON> charged were made routinely by the mainstream media. `` There are journalists in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who find it their goal in life to attack Judaism,'' he said. `` We would like to bring to the people the right face of Judaism. `` The real security of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will be in the moral fabric of the people. We want to bring people back closer to the Jewish roots, to see the strength of the people,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan Softens U.S. Stand on Agricultural Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, seeking to give new impetus to international trade negotiations, announced Thursday he is dropping a demand that other countries join the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in phasing out agricultural subsidies by the year 2000. An eventual elimination of government interventions into farm markets remains the American goal, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. But he acknowledged that talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have beast in part, because of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for a fixed deadline fogged down, at lor getting governments out of the business of subsidizing their agricultural economies. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> failed, at the seven-nation economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> at the end of May, to persuade principal <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade partners to endorse such a timetable, which has been criticized heatedly by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to be taken up at the mid-term review of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of talks under <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. The proposal called for a freeze on all farm price supports, subsidies and trade barriers in the next two years, but made no mention of an end-of-century deadline for phasing subsidies out. Noting the coming mid-term review in t. It is a testament to the commitment of our two governments to the principles of the open market and to economic cooperation.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' government subsidized American agriculture in the amount of more than $ 26 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, and there has been little enthusiasm in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for the administration's push to lower the government's profile in the farming business. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that instead of continuing to pursue agreement on a phase-out deadline of the year 2000, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators will `` be ready to discuss flexible adjustment'' procedures to cushion the shock of ending subsidies. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be `` flexible about timetables so long as everyone agrees on nailing down an adjustment plan with specific dates for ending trade-distorting subsidies and market access barriers. The final goal is what is important.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> recognizes the concerns of many nations among the 96 that are members of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, over the question of `` food security'' _ or the worry on the part of some nations that if trade barriers disappear, they would be left at the mercy of others in the event of food shortages. `` Again, they may have a point,'' he said. `` And so, in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, we'll be ready to talk about government stockpiles, land purchases and other ways of dealing with what has been called ` food security.''' On another matter, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told his business audience that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of seeking to open new markets for American products and to remove trade barriers will continue intact under President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In fact, he said, `` President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been on board every step of the way. Anyone who thinks that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> policy in this area might shift with the new administration or the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is deluding himself.'' He said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would meet with <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> and Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> to `` reiterate our mutual support'' before the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> talks. Among other key objectives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> negotiators in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, are these: _ Steps to improve intellectual property protections, particularly to attack counterfeiting and piracy _ Establish rules which for the first time would cover trade in services, as well as in goods and products _ Steps to bring about greater discipline over trade-related investment

 The Willow Creek Dam above the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> town of <PERSON> Heppner </PERSON> is reliable, according to a review panel asked to look at the safety of the flood-control dam because of worry about erosion. Criticism of the dam's design was without merit, the five-member technical panel said in its report. The dam was the first in the nation built entirely by the roller-compacting method rather than the traditional method of pouring concrete. The review was ordered by Sen. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON>, a ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> energy and water subcommittee. In a statement issued after the panel's report was released Wednesday, <PERSON> Hatfield </PERSON> said the allegations of safety problems were ` quite serious,'' but `` after a thorough study by <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> experts and an independent investigator, it appears reasonable to assert those concerns were unfounded.'' The 169-foot-high dam was completed in 1983 at a cost of $ 34.7 million to protect residents of <PERSON> Heppner </PERSON>. In 1903, one third of the town's population died in a flash flood of <LOCATION> Willow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>.

 Gunmen today kidnapped the Swiss head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>'s mission in the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, authorities said. Lebanese police said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, 32, was grabbed by three gunmen from his official car on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s Hisbeh Square. There was no immediate claim of responsibility. A police spokesman said there were reports <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> was taken to the Palestinian refugee camp of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hilweh </PERSON> on <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s southern outskirts, `` but we have n't been able to verify this.'' The kidnappers, driving a BMW, intercepted <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s white <ORGANIZATION> Peugeot </ORGANIZATION>, grabbed him, pushed him into their car and sped away, the police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. At <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> heaquarters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, officials confirmed the abduction and said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s Lebanese driver was released shortly afterward. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> took up his duties in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, about a month ago, said the police spokesman. He said an emergency meeting was under way between Palestinian guerrilla leaders and the command of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nasserite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> militia in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> to try to determine <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s whereabouts The organization is a leftist Sunni Moslem militia that has been governing <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> since the 1975 outbreak of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bischof </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegates have been abducted before in the region but all were released a few hours later. `` Let's hope this will be again the case this time,'' he said. <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, said the action was aimed against the recent declaration of the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and pledged to find the kidnappers. `` They -LRB- kidnappers -RRB- are not going to get away with it,'' he told reporters. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> proclaimed the birth of the Palestinian state at an extraordinary meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile, in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> on Tueday. Hard-line Palestinian groups backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> oppose the declaration for its tacit recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Swiss ambassador to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Sciolli </PERSON>, said the embassy was waiting for a claim of responsibility in <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s kidnapping. `` At this moment we do not know why he was taken,'' said <PERSON> Scilli </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sciolli </PERSON> said about 30 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials work in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and that a few <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> citizens remain in the Christian sector of the country. All Swiss residents of the Moslem sector left, he said. Not including <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, 14 foreigners, nine of them Americans, are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and believed held hostage. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985 and is being held by a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction calling itself Islamic Jihad, or Holy War.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced today that it has reviewed the cases of 28 Cuban detainees and has decided to send 15 of them back to their homeland `` in the near future.'' The 15, who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the boatlift of 125,000 people from <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, have been convicted of crimes ranging from burglary to first-degree murder, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. The cases of the 28 were reviewed by three-member repatriation review panels set up at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of last year's prison riots by Cuban detainees at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, which were triggered by an agreement with <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to resume sending many of the detainees back to the island. The three-member panels will undertake further review of the remaining 13 detainees of the group of 28 to determine whether they should be returned to the island or released, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aides <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> told a news conference. The 28 are the first cases to be heard by the review panels and are among hundreds of detainees who face repatriation reviews. The two <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aides declined to speculate on when the 15 might be sent back, noting they fully expect that lawyers for them will file court suits. `` We expect to challenge negative decisions in court, arguing that each detainee is entitled to an administrative review by a federal court of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> decision,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leshaw </PERSON>, director of the non-profit <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> legal aid organization representing Mariel detainees. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> action on the 15 moves the government one step closer to undertaking the first deportations of Mariel Cubans to their communist homeland since May 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Separate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> parole review panels were established in the wake of last year's riots and those panels have reviewed 11 cases to date, <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said. The panels determined that six detainees should remain in the custody of the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The other five will receive further review to determine if they are suitable for parole. An agreement between rioting prisoners and the government provided that Cuban detainees who were incarcerated at the time of the disturbances would receive a full, fair and thorough review by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> any </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> decision denying them parole. Deportable Cuban detainees are being held in a strict `` lockdown'' in a penitentiary in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, so another disturbance is considered unlikely. `` I think it is ironic that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government ... chooses to continue on the unfortunate path of deporting people to a country that our own <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador has characterized as ` one of the world's darkest dungeons,''' <PERSON> Leshaw </PERSON> said. Cuban groups in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> were already planning protests. `` We will appeal to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He can block the deportations, even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the airport,'' <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Penalver </PERSON> is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end the riots by 3,800 Mariel detainees last November.

 At least 250 students in the Enterprise School District should receive preventive medication for tuberculosis because of their contact with a senior who has the respiratory disease, officials said.

She said the 16 people who tested positive are on medication. She recommended that at least 250 additional students who may have been exposed to the disease receive medication to prevent future health problems. School officials say a note was sent home with those children suggesting they see a doctor and get preventive medication. The students will be retested in March, <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> said.

 There's nobody home in <LOCATION> Yturria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, except maybe a few prairie dogs and armadillos. But it's on the map, along with 51 other obscure sites that have made the big time for the first time in the 1989 Rand McNally Road Atlas, appearing this week in stores nationwide. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, director of cartographic services at <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McNally </ORGANIZATION>, based in nearby <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION>, says most of the towns were put on the map in response to travelers' suggestions. <LOCATION> Yturria </LOCATION>, 50 miles north of <LOCATION> Brownsville </LOCATION>, has no human residents. But it was added this year because it is the site of the Yturria Ranch, recognized as a historic site by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` Yturria's on there more as a point of interest than as a populated place,'' <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said. `` We really look at places and say, ` Do they have a travel-consumer related value?' In some cases they might be the only point of significance in the area.'' <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said he receives thousands of letters each year from travelers who suggest changes. <PERSON> Vermillion </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, was added after he received a letter from a man who said the 167 mostly elderly residents of <PERSON> Vermillion </PERSON> enjoyed looking at the atlas and planning trips, both real and imaginary. <PERSON> Rohwer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, was added after someone wrote to note that it was the site of an internment camp for Japanese-Americans during World War II, <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said. While <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> says he likes to add new towns when he can, he is limited to what he can fit on the map, especially in the densely populated Northeast. `` You try to make it so there are n't so many things that you lose legibility,'' he said. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> could n't say how many towns were listed in the atlas, but he said he does n't often drop a town. `` Every once in a while, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> will build a dam and a town that was in existence will be under 30 or 40 feet of water,'' he said. `` But very few people will write to say their town no longer exists.''

 Federal agencies probably will recommend 250 to 400 rivers for protection in the nation's Wild and <LOCATION> Scenic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> System </LOCATION>, according to a conservation group which said Thursday that `` things are looking up'' with the accession of a fisherman to the White House. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has identified 500 rivers in its 123 national forests that are eligible for protection and expects `` that at a miniumum 200 will be included,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Coyle </PERSON> of American <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, who said he was also speaking for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, associate chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, chief of the recreation, wilderness and cultural resources division of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency was studying another 60 to 80 rivers on its lands. He did not say how many were expected to be recommended for protection. <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>'s flight was delayed and he could not be at a news conference sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION>, a conservation group chiefly interested in preserving free-flowing rivers. The Wild and Scenic River System was established by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 20 years ago to preserve free-flowing rivers from damming, development along their banks or other harm. So far only 119 segments totaling 9,200 miles have been protected, of which 44 rivers and 1,429 miles in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> were mandated by a bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> last month. The 9,200 miles are only 0.2 percent of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> river system. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION>, said the group estimates that 17 percent of the total has been dammed. `` We are quite hopeful that the Wild and Scenic System will quadruple over the next 10 years,'' he said. In President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, We have a fisherman as president and a fisherman as secretary of state and things are looking up,'' <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Udall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION> secretary for Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said he was preparing an open letter to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that would say, among other things, `` If you are looking for things that do n't cost a lot of money, the wild rivers system is certainly a candidate. The letter will tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> he has the chance `` to preside over the preservation of more miles of free-flowing rivers that all of your predecessors combined,'' <PERSON> Udall </PERSON> said. In 1982 the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified 1,524 river segments totaling 62,000 miles as worthy of study to see if they met the congressionallly criterion of having `` outstandingly remarkable'' features. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said it might take 50 years to bring that many under protection. For some years the service has been studying the idea of a `` river park,'' protecting a river along its entire length. Deputy Director <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said the idea was still being considered for `` a handful _ two or three'' rivers, but the service had not been able to `` put together the right factors to make the proposal acceptable'' to all jurisdictions along the lengths of the candidates. He identified only one candidate, the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. While rivers are being studied, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> impose a quarter-mile buffer zone on each bank where timbering, stock-watering and similar activities are banned. But they can not prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from granting licenses from small hydroelectric dams, favored by 1978 legislation aimed at diversifying energy supplies. The commission grants about 200 licenses a year. <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> said many Westerners saw protection as a `` river grab,'' but `` rivers that are designated often act as an enhancer of local property values.''

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has aghat the date was acceptable to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, but the banned union considered the arrangements tentative. In another development, 51 people ended a hunger strike in the southern city of <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> after winning the reinstatement of the last of about 100 miners dismissed in August for striking. The decision clears away one of the major obstacles blocking promised talks between authorities and the opposition. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo in addition to being leader of the official union alliance known by its Polish initials OPZZ, had challenged <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to a debate Tuesday in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION>. Polish radio announced the debate should take place after the evening news Nov. 30. The state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> later carried an identical report. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Tuesday agreed in principle for a televised debate on union issues. It would be <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s first appearance on state TV since 1983, when he challenged then-Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> during a televised speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Lenin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipyard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s prime minister in September. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> for comment were not successful. His wife said he was not at his <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> home. Solidarity spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> confirmed the date was acceptable to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, but said the union considered it to be tentative. He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> earlier authorized Solidarity adviser <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON> and Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> to make the technical arrangements. But neither of them was at home late Tuesday to answer questions. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> will face the cameras alone without any advisers for 45 to 60 minutes, the radio report said. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> indicated the debate might be a partial substitute for the talks authorities promised during the August wave of strikes. The talks were to consider the issue of union pluralism and broader topics of economic and political reform. Besides the fate of the dismissed miners, the talks have been delayed by government objections to the participation of Solidarity advisers <PERSON> Jacek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michnik </PERSON>. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> has headed the official unions since they were set up by the government in 1982 after the authorities banned Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union. Solidarity supporters, demanding their union be made legal again, believe more than one union should be allowed in each workplace because the OPZZ does not adequately represent workers. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> favors one union in one enterprise and says Solidarity activists are welcome to join his unions and try to change them from within. In <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON>, a spokesman for 51 people fasting since Saturday in the Christ the King Cathedral, said the agreement to rehire dismissed workers was reached through the mediation of Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Damian </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimon </PERSON>. `` We managed to achieve in five days what had n't been achieved in several months,'' said <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON>, speaking by telephone from the cathedral. He said agreement was reached late Wednesday with the national coal federation to reinstate the workers as of Thursday. Workers broke their fast Thursday morning, eating rolls with butter and sweetened tea, <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Slomka </PERSON> said 49 miners who still had not been reinstated were to be restored to their old jobs. He said only two workers at the <LOCATION> Stalowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wola </LOCATION> steel mill in southeast <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, another region of the country, have not gotten back their jobs since the August strikes. <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Napieracz </PERSON>, a deputy director at the coal federation, the body that oversees the mines, confirmed the reinstatements, but he denied they had been fired. He said officials wanted to reassign them, while the miners insisted on their jobs back.

As part of the plea agreement, <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, will be disbanded and forfeit its $ 100,000 inventory of pictures and videotapes of sexual acts, according to the court papers. The company agreed to enter guilty pleas to obscenity charges in federal courts in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and pay a $ 600,000 fine. In return, the government will drop 18 felony obscenity charges against <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, where he was indicted earlier this year along with his company. Remaining criminal charges pending against the company in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> will also be dismissed in return for the firm's guilty plea to one count of mailing or transporting obscene material, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON> also agreed to cooperate with the government's continuing investigation of pornography distributors, including giving grand jury testimony Details of the plea agreement were filed in court as part of an out-of-court settlement of <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON>'s lawsuit to prevent his indictment in more than one state. On June 8, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> issued a preliminary injunction barring the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from bringing criminal charges against <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON> and his company in more than one federal court jurisdiction. The department had planned to charge <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to prosecute <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON> in more than one jurisdiction raised constitutional questions. <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON> and his company had contended that the government's strategy was `` unlawfully and unconstitutionally preventing plaintiffs from engaging in a legal occupation. As part of the proposed settlement, which <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is expected to approve, the injunction will be dissolved and <PERSON> Freedberg </PERSON>'s civil lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will be dismissed. In the settlement document submitted to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it `` continues to deny its multi-district prosecution policy is unconstitutional or contrary to law.''

 A car belonging to four young adults missing since Saturday was found in a river today with four bodies in it, police and witnesses said. Identities of the victims were not immediately released. The car had approached a swing bridge open at the time and went over a concrete barrier into the water, said Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrentino </PERSON>, police spokesman. Police divers at the scene said they had found four bodies in the car. <PERSON> Forrentino </PERSON> refused to confirm that. The discovery came four days after three women and one man, ages 19 and 20, disappeared after drinking illegally at a bar near <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and leaving together about 3 a.m. Sunday, said state police Detective <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudelle </PERSON>. He said the information came from an employee of the bar, which under state law ca n't serve anyone under 21. Police divers found the group's car submerged in about 15 feet of water in the <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, in a little-traveled, old industrial part of the city, police said. A crane was brought in to remove the car. Earlier today, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Bud </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and a private investigator looking for the four, said he believed the friends from East Lyme were being held against their will by someone. The four were last seen by their parents at 7 p.m. Saturday, when they left for an evening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> was hired by their parents. `` I believe they're in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> and being held against their wills,'' said <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON>, who also worked previously for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. His first major case with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was as an agent assigned to the 1963 kidnapping of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Family and friends described the four former high school buddies as responsible adults unlikely to take off without telling anyone The parents distributed pictures of the missing and offered a $ 25,000 reward, <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> today denounced as `` unjustified'' Iraqi's expulsion of an American diplomat and retaliated by throwing out an Iraqi diplomat stationed here. Referring to the American diplomat, identified in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Haywood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s political section, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` None of his activities have been incompatible in any way with his diplomatic status.'' Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> informed the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Abdul-Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Anbari </PERSON>, that an Iraqi diplomat here had been declared persona non grata, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said. He said `` this action was taken in response to the unjustified expulsion of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> goverment.'' <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> declined to identify the Iraqi or his job. In <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, diplomats said <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON> was asked to leave <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> after making an unauthorized trip to the north, home of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s estimated 3.5 million Kurds. Both the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> refused to comment on <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>'s expulsion. Diplomats said he already has left <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. About 60,000 Kurds fled across the northern border to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and thousands of others went into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in August, claiming <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped chemical bombs on their villages. Militants among the 20 million Kurds living in a region extending into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have fought for independence for a century. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> pounded Kurdish settlements on its northwestern border shortly after accepting an Aug. 20 cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Kurdish guerrillas received support from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the war. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> considered economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, based on <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports it was using chemical weapons against the Kurds. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denied the use and the legislation was dropped in the rush to close <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before the November presidential elections in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Local civil rights leaders have accused <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> officials of racism in bypassing a black Fulbright Scholar and selecting a white man with less experience as its new president. Local <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> officals said Wednesday they believe racial prejudice influenced the appointment last week of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, who has been president of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rocks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, since March 1987. `` The black candidate is a Fulbright Scholar, studied at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and has 20 years' experience as a college president. The white candidate has 20 months' experience as a college president,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, state and local president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. `` It was just so obvious the black candidate was so much more qualified.'' Trustees at the college voted 5-2 to appoint <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 47, rather than <PERSON> Abel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 54, president at <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Reedley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, for 15 years. The <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> called for the decision to be overturned and filed complaints with the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Higher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. State officials said they would investigate. Some trustees defended the appointment. `` Racism was not an issue in the selection,'' said <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, chairman of the college's board of trustees. `` I think we had three qualified candidates provided by the search committee. We chose one of them.'' The lone black board member, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, disagreed. `` If <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> was white, there is no question that he would have been chosen,'' <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said. `` What's worse, had I not been on the search committee, Dr. <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON>' name would have never come up. I'm disappointed and devastated. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> was board chairman but was removed from that position after the vote on <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> said board members told him he was ousted because they felt he could not support the new president. The two-year college serves 12,000 students in eight counties surrounding <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION>.

 Housing construction in October posted the biggest increase in eight months, the government said Thursday in a report taken as evidence that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has n't yet curbed excessive economic growth. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction began on new homes and apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million units last month, up 7.2 percent from September. It was the highest level since April and the sharpest increase since February. `` This is yet one more sign that our economy is doing very well,'' said <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> governor, now chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` The consumer is very confident. There are a lot of jobs available ... We've had some instability in the financial markets, but nothing to worry the consumer excessively,'' he said. A month ago, most economists were saying the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s program of pushing up interest rates since late March was beginning to take hold, slowing economic growth to a pace considered sustainable without inflation But starting Nov. 4 with the release of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report on October employment, most signs have pointed to renewed vigor in the economy, suggesting the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may push interest rates up another notch to dampen growth The unemployment rate last month was at a 14-year low, retail sales registered their sharpest increase in eight months, and the operating rate at factories, mines and utilities hit an 8 -LCB- - year high Exports in September climbed to a new record. However, excessive economic strength can be too much of a good thing, straining manufacturers' ability to produce, leading to shortages of goods and higher prices. The goal of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is to check the growth through higher interest rates without choking it off completely. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> tightening since March has n't taken a heck of a lot of steam out of the economy,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> and a former <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> staff member. He predicted a hike in the discount rate, the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges member banks for loans, by the end of the year. `` We know the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will do whatever it takes to slow the economy down, and that means slowing the housing sector down. So we're a little worried about the future,'' he said. The big gain in housing starts last month followed two declines: 0.8 percent in September and a 1.1 percent in August. Although the October number was strong, economists noted that the biggest part of the increase was concentrated in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market is booming. They also said a temporary decline in mortgage interest rates of more than half a percentage point between mid-August and early November bolstered activity. `` What we're seeing is primarily a Western phenomenon,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Obrinsky </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think, in retrospect, we'll see this as a little bit of a spike. We may see this pace for another month or so, but we surely wo n't see it for another six months.'' Excluding the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, where the robust economy and population growth of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dominate the statistics, the overall increase would have been a more moderate 3.9 percent. Housing starts shot up 15 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to 498,000 units, the highest level since December 1986. Starts rose 7.6 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 268,000 units, climbed 4.6 percent in the South to 586,000 units and fell 2.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to 202,000. For the first 10 months of the year, housing starts were running 9.6 percent behind the same period of 1987. The peak year for housing construction during the current economic expansion was 1986, when 1.81 million units were started. Starts fell to 1.62 million last year and are expected to hit 1.45 million this year. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumichrast </PERSON>, a private real estate economist in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said rising interest rates and high home prices likely will push starts down even further to about 1.35 million units next year. Single-family homes in October were built at an annual rate of 1.15 million units, up 10.0 percent, following a 3.3 percent decline a month earlier. Apartment construction was up a scant 0.2 percent to 408,000 units in October after rising 6.3 percent in September. Building permits, a good indicator of future housing activity, shot up 7.4 percent in October to an annual rate of 1.50 million units, the highest since September 1987. Permits had fallen 4.8 percent a month earlier.

 The wife of Israeli Premier <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> met Thursday with Bulgarian leader <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, and another Bulgarian official said diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be resumed once unspecified hindrances are gone. <PERSON> Shulamit </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> but left at age 17 in 1941, held no substantive talks with <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>, according to Bulgarian officials at the meeting in <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON>'s official residence.

When that conference ended Thursday, Bulgarian host <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON>, head of the government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Sofia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, was asked whether the symposium _ the first of its kind in <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bulgaria </ORGANIZATION>'s history _ might help to restore ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Diplomatic relations will be established after hindrances are removed,'' <PERSON> Petrov </PERSON> told an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> journalist at a news conference.

 The West German government today paid $ 1.98 million _ the highest price ever for a modern literary treasure _ for the handwritten manuscript of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s novel `` The Trial.'' The amount paid for the manuscript, which came from an unidentified seller, eclipsed the $ 605,000 paid in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year for <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s letters to his fiancee, <PERSON> Felice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>. The buyer was a West German antiquarian bookseller, <PERSON> Heribert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON>, who said he was contacted by West German government authorities to buy the manuscript for the <ORGANIZATION> Marbach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Literary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>. `` It was really surprising, the price,'' he said. `` I would have bought it for myself'' The bidding lasted only one minute, starting at $ 720,000 dollars and rising in $ 90,000 increments against one other unidentified bidder. The selling price was $ 1.8 million but <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, the auction house, adds a 10 percent commission to the price. The 316-page German-language manuscript was finished in 1920 and published in 1925, a year after <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>, a German-speaking Czechoslovak Jew, died of tuberculosis at age 41. The novel has become a symbol of the 20th century alienation, totalitarianism and choking bureaucracy. The hero, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON>, who has done nothing wrong, is arrested, tried and executed without ever being informed of his charges. <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> instructed his literary executor, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Brod </PERSON>, to burn his works, but <PERSON> Brod </PERSON> ignored the order. <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> only wrote two other novels, `` The Castle,'' and the unfinished `` Amerika.'' His short story, `` The Metamorphosis,'' is another modern classic. The previous record for a purely literary work was $ 370,000 paid in July 1985 for a notebook of poetry and prose by the Irish writer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., said Thursday that meeting health and safety concerns should be a main component in the decision on whether to keep open a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> plant that makes `` absolutely critical'' components for rocket nozzles `` It is essential to our national security to keep this plant operating, providing we can meet the health and safety concerns of the people in the immediate area,'' <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said after headingg a meeting between the federal and state agencies concerned with the <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fiber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plant in Front Royal, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The closed-door meeting was intended to trade information about the situation among the various agencies, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> want Avtex to stay in business, because the plant is the only supplier for a carbonizable rayon fiber which is a key component of rocket nozzles for the space shuttle and some of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear-tipped weapons. But the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> attorney general's office want Avtex to clean up the plant that has a history of environmental and worker safety problems. On Oct. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Avtex </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> announced he would close the Front Royal plant because of environmental regulations and foreign competition for other textile products made by <PERSON> Avtex </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> stopped production Nov. 3, but recalled the work force one week later as the government began a bailout of Avtex. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> gave Avtex $ 7 million for the rights to the fiber. The space agency said it will sign an $ 11 million contract for the fiber, if Avtex can show by Friday it will generate enough contracts to keep the plant in business. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> noted that only three or four percent of the Avtex's production involves the nozzle materials But he said `` it would require as much as two years'' to develop another source for this material. In the meantime, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> national security could be harmed if missiles could n't be launched, he said. One example he gave was the use of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> missiles to launch reconnaissance satellites. One major concern, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said, is to make sure that any federal bailout money is not used to pay off any fines which could be levied against Avtex.

 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said today the acceptance by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> parliament-in-exile of two key <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> is a `` modest step forward'' on which progress toward peace could be made. At a news conference shortly before ending her two-day visit here, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> offered a slightly more upbeat assessment of the declaration by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the legislative arm of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, than has the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. She criticized the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION> for proclaiming the establishment of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state and said the declaration did not go far enough in repudiating terrorism. `` Obviously there are a lot of things in it that none of us like,'' she said. But she said that approval of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338 `` is a modest step forward and something on which you could build.'' The resolutions call for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from occupied territories and assert the right of all countries to live within secure borders. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> added that `` strenuous efforts'' should be made to get peace negotiations going in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> reaffirmed her high regard for President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, citing his extensive experience in government as a major asset. `` You will have a president who does n't have to be briefed,'' she said. Earlier, she said she had `` not the slightest shadow of a doubt'' that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deal responsibly with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deficit. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> repeated similar expressions of confidence in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy in three network television interviews prior to meeting with the vice president for breakfast. The meeting followed an evening of reminiscing at a state dinner with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whom she described as `` a marvelous president.'' `` I have not the slightest shadow of doubt that in good time the deficit will be considered in a responsible way,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said in an interview on `` CBS This Morning.'' `` I do n't share concerns about <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ability to deal with fundamental problems,'' she said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` I think he will deal with them in his own time and in his own way and very responsibly indeed.'' On <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers will need time to come up with policies for dealing with the deficit. `` I do n't think we should hurry them,'' she said. When Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> arrived at the vice president's residence for her meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he greeted her as `` the star of ` Good Morning America'.'' The prime minister said in the interviews, all broadcast live from <LOCATION> Blair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, that she and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were talking about the world economy, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and East-West ties. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who was ending her two-day state visit this afternoon after a news conference, said Wednesday that the Western alliance is `` very fortunate'' to have <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successor. `` For the first time we will have continuity of policies, stretching over a second presidency. And that brings enormous stability and confidence to the feeling of the world,'' she told reporters as she sat next to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> during an Oval Office photo session. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also has said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` We know him as a friend, we admire him as a man of unrivaled experience and we respect him because he stands for all that is best in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' After a private meeting between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joined a subsequent meeting attended by top officials of both governments. Like most others in the room, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said little, deferring to the president and the prime minister, who met in their respective capacities for the last time. Despite signs that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will be able to work well together, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have a difficult time matching the partnership <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> forged with the British leader. The White House arrival ceremony for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> on Wednesday was filled with expressions of mutual admiration. `` Together our nations have faced the challenges of our time, and have not flinched. We forged ahead with strengthening the peace, spreading prosperity and safeguarding liberty,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> lauded Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for her `` extraordinary role in the revitalization of freedom,'' and said she has contributed to a `` remarkable change'' in her country through policies that encourage individual creativity. Looking beyond his own term of office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> added, `` It is profoundly reassuring to me and to all who care about freedom that you will continue to share with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> your vision and your steady hand.''

<HEAD>Study Says America Shortchanging Half Its Youth</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is short-changing half its young adults by treating those who do n't attend college as failures and offering them little help starting careers and families, according to a report released Thursday. The study of 16 - to-24-year-olds by the private <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Future found that young people who lack college training `` are far more constrained than were their peers of 15 years ago'' because of shrinking economic prospects For those without a college degree, there are fewer `` jobs with a future,'' real earnings are declining faster, unemployment is more likely, and marriage is often postponed because of financial pressures, it said. The study refers to the nation's 20 million non-college-bound youth as the `` forgotten half'' of their generation, many of whom never will overcome unemployment, part-time jobs with few benefits and poverty-level wages. `` Too often, we think of the forgotten half as failures, as second-rate, simply because they do not attend college,'' said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commissioner of education who headed the 19-member commission. `` They must be viewed as our hope for the future rather than as a generation of misfits.'' <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> said at a news conference that the highest priority in helping more young adults succeed should be to strengthen existing programs to keep youngsters on the right track, such as Head Start and the Job Corps. The commission recommended a $ 5 billion a year increase in federal financing for such projects. The commission, established by the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and made up of people from business, labor, government, education and health and human services, also recommended: _ Creation of a five-year, $ 1.25 billion federally financed, state-run national demonstration project to improve access to education and training through financial aid, counseling and academic support _ More community programs emphasizing service and leadership to help young people get involved in civic activities, thereby building self-respect and keeping them away from drugs and other trouble _ Expanded education, training and employment programs by businesses and local governments that are targeted to young people _ Programs to strengthen adult-youth relationships in families, including policies at schools and businesses that take into account the demands placed on working parents The report said the school reform movement of the 1980s has focused too heavily on the college-bound and that financial support for those students far outweighs what is available to those who do n't continue their education. College students typically can expect public-private subsidies of $ 5,000 per school year through scholarships, grants and loans, while only about 5 percent of eligible non-college-bound youth receive federal job training assistance totaling $ 1,800 - $ 2,300 over about four months, it said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yankelovich </PERSON>, a member of the commission and president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankelovich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the relatively low jobless rates of recent years mask the problem of high unemployment and underemployment among young adults. `` Under those statistics is a festering problem that looks like it's going to get worse and that merits the country's attention in a way that is almost impossible to exaggerate,'' <PERSON> Yankelovich </PERSON> said. `` The 1990s, if something is n't done about this, will result in a tremendous amount of social unrest.'' Another commission member, Rev. <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesburgh </PERSON>, president emeritus of Notre Dame, said the 208-page report was `` full of hopelessness,'' but that its account of volunteers who have n't given up on disadvantaged young people provides `` hope in what is otherwise a dismal picture.''

 The government Thursday imposed its first ban on a right-wing extremist group, and the ex-policeman whose deadly shooting spree prompted the crackdown was sent to a mental hospital for tests. Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON> banned the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a small white supremacist group, invoking the same emergency regulations that have been used against black anti-apartheid organizations. <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, the 23-year-old gunman who killed six blacks in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> on Tuesday, has not been linked to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> but belongs to the neo-Nazi <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a much larger, more influential group. <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>, who promised a broad crackdown on right-wing extremists because of the rampage, did not explain why only the smaller group was banned. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, who quit the national police force in February while facing misconduct charges, was arraigned Thursday in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> on charges of murdering six blacks and wounding 17. Witnesses said he laughed as he walked through the heart of the capital city Tuesday, shooting his victims from close range with an automatic pistol. Dr. <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieterse </PERSON>, a court-appointed psychiatrist, said <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> showed symptoms of being a psychopath and had expressed pride in what he had done. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, who smiled throughout the hearing, was sent to <LOCATION> Weskoppies </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> for 30 days of observation and ordered to reappear in court Dec. 19. Police said they were investigating the possibility <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> was involved in an incident Nov. 8 in which a black woman was shot to death at a squatter camp south of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The White Liberation Movement was formed in 1985 but did not come to public notice until 1987. Its leader, <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schabort </PERSON>, said it had more than 1,000 members, but many more sympathizers. Aside from a few rallies and an attempt to march through a multiracial area last year, little has been heard from the organization. <PERSON> Schabort </PERSON>, a biochemist, was issued with restrictions Thursday confining him to the area around his hometown of Brits and barring him from addressing more than 10 people at a time. He said the government's action reduced the `` outlet for frustration of white South Africans ... Now we can not control people who are worried about their race survival. Some of them could organize underground.'' <PERSON> Schabort </PERSON>'s group has called for expulsion of all Jewish and Indian <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> and the removal of all blacks from white urban centers, including the `` clearing out'' of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, where 2.5 million blacks live near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schabort </PERSON> said he blamed the government for Tuesday's rampage. `` Whites are living under tremendous pressure and are being undermined by blacks,'' he said. `` Many whites are also working under tremendous pressure, especially in the police force.'' Members of the national police force are prohibited from belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, but observers believe many officers have links or sympathies with the group. Members of the resistance movement frequently dress in khaki uniforms and wear swastika-type emblems and weapons. The group's leader, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Terreblanche </PERSON>, says whites should fight any attempt by the government to share political power with blacks <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, who wore a khaki outfit at his arraignment, said he rejected the court's authority. Speaking in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> told the court, `` if communists such as -LRB- Anglican Archbishop -RRB- <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> and -LRB- former ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Worrall </PERSON> are arrested, then I will cooperate. I do not have any interest in appearing before this court under the current state of government.'' <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> frequently turned to wave at his family in the courtroom, which was packed and guarded by policemen with shotguns. In an unusual move, photographers were allowed inside. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>'s mother raised her fist and said, `` Strength,'' in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION>. Since Feb. 23, anti-apartheid organizations have been banned. Government critics have asked why right-wing white organizations that appear to espouse violence are not banned.

 A federal judge fined <ORGANIZATION> Orkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exterminating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> $ 500,000 for a fumigation that killed a couple, and he said safety practices at the nation's biggest pest-control service were `` scary'' in their laxity. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> convicted <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> in August of failing to monitor the air before letting <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freida </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> back into their <LOCATION> Galax </LOCATION> home in 1986. Turk on Wednesday imposed the maximum fine but said <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> will have to pay only $ 350,000 if it stays out of trouble during two years of corporate probation. <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> also said officers of the company must perform 2,000 hours of community service. The corporation was the only defendant in the case. `` It's nothing short of scary the way the company was handling its business,'' he said. Relatives of the victims declined comment as they left the courtroom. Testimony indicated <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> not only failed to monitor the air after fumigating the <ORGANIZATION> Watsons </ORGANIZATION>' home, but also did not remove a waterproof mattress cover on their bed. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said poisonous gas seeped into the mattress until the <ORGANIZATION> Watsons </ORGANIZATION> went to bed and their movements released the gas. `` That was a tomb sealed up, waiting for the occupants to enter and lay down and die,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 73, and his 65-year-old wife died days later. Experts said they were killed by <PERSON> Vikane </PERSON>, used to exterminate wood-boring insects. <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> President <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> took the stand and said he had improved training since he took over the company in February. `` I recognize there was a failure to carry out <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON>'s policy and procedures'' in the <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> case, <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> said he was appalled at testimony from past and present <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> employees who descibed a lack of compliance with safety requirements and a lack of knowledge about them as well. `` It's almost a miracle that something like this did n't happen before,'' <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON>, who supervised the <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> fumigation and dozens of others, testified that he never bothered to read the fine print on Vikane labels. <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON>'s president and attorneys had no comment after sentencing. <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Donner </PERSON> said from the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> headquarters that <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> was disappointed with the sentence but `` wants to express sympathy to the <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> family for the loss.'' <PERSON> Orkin </PERSON> reached an undisclosed settlement with the <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> estate two months ago.

 Assailants hurled bombs at a public meeting and into a video store Thursday, and police opened fire to disperse anti-government protesters during ethnic unrest that killed at least 17 people, officials said. One person was killed and 10 were injured when police opened fire to break up an anti-government demonstration in the north-central <LOCATION> Kurunegala </LOCATION> district, a government communique said. In <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, Sinhalese radicals threw bombs at a meeting being addressed by <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonasekara </PERSON>, one of the three candidates for next month's presidential elections, police said. At least 40 people suffered minor injuries in the attack and an ensuing stampede, said officials, who were not identified in accordance with briefing rules. Military officials said three people were killed and one was injured when a bomb was thrown at a video center just south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. They said the video center was attacked because it stayed open last week when the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a militant Sinhalese group, called for an anti-government strike. The victims were shop employees. At least 13 people were killed by radical Sinhalese in the south and center of the island, and three Sinhalese men were shot and killed by Tamil rebels in the northeast, said police and military officials. The attacks occurred Wednesday and Thursday. Officials said among the victims were four government supporters, a bus driver, a school principal, two employees of the <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> port, a civilian clerk and his nephew. The port employees were involved in compiling lists of employees' names so police could escort them to work during a strike at the port last week, sources said The military officials gave no reasons for the other killings, but the victims were believed to be Sinhalese who defied the strike. Sinhalese militants are agitating for the resignation of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, himself a Sinhalese. They are opposed to an accord <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> signed that is aimed at ending Tamil rebels' five-year war for autonomy. Sinhalese radicals say the accord, signed July 29, 1987, makes too many concessions to the minority Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the 16 million population. The main Tamil rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, has refused to accept the accord, saying it does not go far enough. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> stepped up its anti-government campaign last week and called for a four-day strike in the south, which crippled business in the Sinhalese heartland and caused food and gasoline shortages. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> hit back by ordering troops to open fire at anti-government demonstrations and decreeing the death penalty for anyone convicted of instigating strikes. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON> is to leave office in January and elections to choose his successor are scheduled Dec. 19. The Front says he should resign immediately. The group called for a boycott of the elections and has threatened to kill all the candidates.

<HEAD>Six-Year Study Concludes Arts Need More Federal Support</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government support of the arts is needed to supplement private giving, a presidential committee told President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Thursday after a six-year study. The committee, created by a presidential executive order in 1982, presented its report to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. The committee noted that during the 1980s there has been `` a diminution of tax incentives for charitable giving'' and warned that `` reduced incentives can damage the vitality of American philanthropy.'' `` The main vehicle for support of the arts and humanities remains private monies, a resource that must be encouraged and increased,'' the report said. `` We firmly believe government support is necessary, however, for it seems clear that the culture of this country can not be sustained solely by private funding.'' The federal government currently provides support for the arts through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the Humanities, and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which have combined current budgets of $ 330.1 million. The report called for the creation of a presidential commission made up of both leading private citizens and government officials. `` There should be sufficient annual appropriations to sustain the federal government's capacity as grantor; innovative leadership to inspire its role as catalyst; and continued incentives through the tax system to encourage private giving,'' the committee said. It said private giving to the arts and humanities has grown at a greater rate than inflation since 1980 but the two major tax revisions passed during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration resulted in reduced incentives for charitable contributions. The 35-member committee was made up of leaders of business, government and the arts under the chairmanship of <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Heiskell </PERSON>, retired chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. It held meetings throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and made a recommendation in 1984 that led to establishment of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, presented annually by the president. Executive director <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paton </PERSON> said the committee operated on an annual budget of about $ 300,000.

<HEAD>Catholic Bishops Decry Religious Persecution in Soviet Bloc</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT FURLOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops said Thursday the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government could help fight `` sustained and comprehensive'' religious persecution in the Soviet bloc by linking that issue to others the Soviets care about. In a lengthy document, the bishops detailed what they saw as religious intolerance and discrimination in the nations of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but they also suggested the time may be right to win improvement. They said Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s stated policies of openness and restructuring `` offer potentially significant changes in thought and practice and deserve to be taken seriously and encouraged ... as a potential basis for gradual expansion of freedoms.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government `` should consider the possibility of using affirmative measures to influence human rights policies and practices, including developing closer relations, extending credits and encouraging cultural and educational exchanges and tourism,'' the bishops said. `` In all such initiatives <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomacy should make it clear that continued improvement in relations will depend in part on continued improvement with regard to religious liberty and human rights.'' The statement was approved on the last day of the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier Thursday, on a matter closer to home, the church leaders called for changes in a 1986 federal law covering legalization of illegal aliens, many of whom are <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Hispanics. They said more Hispanics should be allowed to stay in this country legally, and they complained in particular that the law's provisions on penalties for employers who hire undocumented workers are poorly understood and lead to discrimination against Hispanic workers in general The two new statements backed up the declaration earlier this week by the conference's president, Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, that the bishops would continue to speak out on controversial public issues despite criticism. The bishops, leaders of the nation's largest religious denomination with more than 53 million members, spent much of the week concentrating on an intra-church dispute with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. They rejected a Rome-prepared draft document that questioned the authority of their conference and others like it. However, May continued to play down talk of any major confrontation. `` I do n't look on these discussions as a tug-of-war or an ongoing fight or crisis or any of these words that are used,'' he said at a news conference after the meeting ended Wednesday. `` We are in a most serene time,'' May said, adding that Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> had spoken favorably of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> church during American bishops' visits to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> this year. The bishops appeared solidly united in loud voice votes favoring the new statements on religion in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and on treatment of Hispanic immigrants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Archbishop <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said the bishops were challenging Soviet leaders, whose policies have heavy influence throughout <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` to match their recent talk of reform with concrete action.'' Despite improvements in some countries, the church leaders said in their statement, `` The scale of persecution has been and remains sustained and comprehensive, and its roster of victims all inclusive: Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews, <PERSON> Muslims </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jehovah </PERSON>'s Witnesses and many others.'' Although church attendance is sometimes allowed, religiously active people are often subject to discrimination in other areas, the bishops said. Concerning Hispanics, the church leaders said many employers do n't understand the immigration law's provisions and thus fire or refuse to hire many eligible Hispanics out of fear of being raided and fined by the government. The bishops called for action on three fronts: compiling detailed records of discrimination to force <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to change the law, promoting legislation to provide legalization opportunities to more recent immigrants and educating employers on provisions of the current law.

Commuters rushing through the <ORGANIZATION> Gare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lyon </ORGANIZATION> railway station at 7 a.m. were offered a Beaujolais breakfast, poured from a special high-speed train that carried cases of the wine to the capital. A huge crowd of happy commuters gathered around the railway car flowing with <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON> `` primeur,'' the first wine produced from the autumn harvest. <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON>, a grower pouring wine at the train, took a few sips of the juicy Beaujolais nouveau himself before moving on to the next official party, scheduled for 11 a.m. `` Wine drinking is a habit with people in <LOCATION> Beaujolais </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I can go to 10 wine tastings and never get drunk ... at least I hope so.'' <PERSON> Benoit </PERSON> hurried from the station to a sound stage at <LOCATION> Pathe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cinema </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> where a reconstructed <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON> village served as the setting for an elaborate tasting attended by about 500 journalists and friends of the Beaujolais wine growers association. `` This wine is completely different from last year's, much more of a Gamay taste,'' said <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Deflache </PERSON>, who produces wine on land owned by his family since 1550 and also serves as spokesman for the Beaujolais wine growers' association. Deflache poured glasses of wine under a plastic cherry tree on the town's quaint main street, across from an old-fashioned pharmacy. `` This year's <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON> is generous in the mouth, more full-bodied. It is a more masculine wine,'' <PERSON> Deflache </PERSON> said. Across town at <LOCATION> Le </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Val </LOCATION> <LOCATION> d'Or </LOCATION> wine bar off the Champs Elysees, owner <PERSON> Geraud </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongier </PERSON> was quickly emptying two 220-liter barrels. `` This year, it's good, very light, very perfumed,'' <PERSON> Rongier </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> newspaper described this year's batch as `` more nuanced, more subtle, more traditional than last year's'' which was said to have an aftertaste of bananas. Wine growers say the 1988 vintage has had the advantage of being one of the earliest harvests in a long while. The harvest Sept. 10, compared with Sept. 22 last year, gave producers a longer time to make the wine which is meant to be consumed quickly, but benefits from a few weeks in the bottle. Not all Frenchmen are seduced by the hype and extravagant tastings, and remind the unwary foreigner that the new <PERSON> Beaujolais </PERSON> once was regarded as cheap table wine. `` I never drank the stuff before all this started and I still do n't,'' growled one seasoned customer in a bar Thursday morning. Two decades of clever marketing have paid off and more than half of this year's estimated 50 million bottles of new Beaujolais will be exported. Since Monday, jets, trucks and trains have been delivering the wine to far-flung bon vivants, some of whom beat Parisians to the first sip. Australians claimed they were the first, popping corks on the simple, fruity wine 11 hours ahead of the French because of the difference in time zones. Japanese wine lovers held parties at restaurants about 8 hours before the French. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Suntory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese distiller and importer, said overall Japanese imports will total 153,000 cases, an increase of 70 percent over last year. The wine, which sells for about $ 3.30 a bottle here, will cost the equivalent of $ 42 a bottle in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> restaurants, according to wine officials in <LOCATION> Beaujolais </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the fastest growing market for the new wine, which accounts for 55 percent of the total Beaujolais crop, it is not the biggest market. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> combined drink 60 percent of the exported Beaujolais nouveau. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market represents about 10 percent of the new Beaujolais sales and celebrations were planned for Thursday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. About 500 people were expected at a Beaujolais soiree sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Deflache </PERSON> said. `` There are always new markets for this uncomplicated wine,'' he said. `` And everyone likes an occasion to party.''

 Two Belgian air force F-16 jet fighters crashed Thursday in separate incidents, and their pilots escaped injury, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. The pilots ejected and parachuted to safety. The first plane had taken off from the nearby air force base of <PERSON> Kleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Brogel </PERSON> and was on a training flight when it hit birds and crashed in <LOCATION> Kaulille </LOCATION>, a ministry official said. Military investigators had gone to the scene near the Dutch border, about 60 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the capital, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The second plane crashed in <LOCATION> Willbringen </LOCATION>, 19 miles east of <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. No reason was given for the crash. The crashes brought to 19 the number of F-16s lost by the Belgian air force since it started using the planes in 1979.

 A 12-year-old lowland gorilla who made a hit in her last home with unexpected trips outside her cage is on loan in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> to become a mate and stepmother. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> has been introduced to what Columbus Zoo officials hope will be her new mate, <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> has been raising <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON> for over a year since the young gorilla's mother, <PERSON> Bridgette </PERSON>, died from peritonitis. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> was airlifted Oct. 4 from the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, Zoo to take over mothering <PERSON> Fossey </PERSON> and perhaps _ in concert with <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> _ raise a few Fosseys of her own.

 Burning of more than 450 <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 rocket motors as part of the Treaty on <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate-Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> will begin Dec. 5 at the <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Activity </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. Similar motor burns have been going on at the <ORGANIZATION> Longhorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ammunition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, since Sept. 8. Army spokesmen said the Pueblo burns would be witnessed by a team from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, as called for in the treaty. The rocket motors will be static fired, restrained by a concrete and steel structure. The burned-out motor cases then will be crushed and buried at the depot, 16 miles east of <LOCATION> Pueblo </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> gave permission Nov. 1 for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> to burn the motors. The permit requires emissions monitoring, governs the frequency of burns and limits them to be fired only when winds from the west are 4 mph or greater and only during daylight. Only one missile can be fired per hour and no more than six per day. Emissions of any pollutant may not exceed 250 tons per year. The depot is scheduled to destroy 234 <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 Stage I motors, each containing 7,940 pounds of propellant, and 233 <ORGANIZATION> Pershing </ORGANIZATION> 2 Stage 2 motors, each containing 4,940 pounds of propellant, state authorities said. The rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s stockpile of 849 Pershing 2 missiles are being destroyed at the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> site, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said. The burn-date announcement caps an 11-month process that included a test firing of one rocket motor last May at the depot. Public meetings and hearings and analysis of environmental effects also were part of the process. At the time the permit was issued, Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON> said he had wanted <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to help destroy the motors `` so that this country could fulfill its treaty obligations.

 Officials from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> made progress Thursday in efforts to hold parliamentary talks on peace measures on the peninsula, including a declaration of non-aggression. The progress raised hopes that the rival states would be able to begin major political negotiations next year. `` There was big progress today and I myself was surprised -LRB- at it -RRB-,'' chief South Korean delegatge <PERSON> Park </PERSON> <PERSON> Joon-kyu </PERSON> said after the meeting at this truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Park's North Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Chon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kum </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol </PERSON>, also noted the progress and said, `` The meeting achieved progress, and I hope we would be able to come to a complete agreement before the end of this year.'' Park, heading the five-member South Korean team, said the two sides could solve all pending issues, including an agenda, when they meet for a seventh round of talks at this village Dec. 15. The progress came as a surprise because all past talks on the subject ended in deadlock with neither side willing to make major concessions. The last meeting here on Oct. 13 broke up over basic and procedural matters. The meeting Thursday was the sixth session since mid-August on trying to set the terms for full-scale talks between the two nations' parliaments on non-aggression, economic and humanitarian negotiations. The meeting made a headway when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> surprisingly accepted most of earlier South Korean proposals on the format of reduced main talks and other procedural matters. At the start of the meeting, the two sides quickly agreed the full legislatures of each side would attend the start of the negotiations in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> proposed actual talks should be handled by 100 delegates from each side, while the south said 20 from each side would be more pradctical. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> revised its figure to 50, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> finally accepted. The North Koreans also made some procedural changes, prompting South Korean delegates to delcare that they would be able to travel to the northern capital next spring to begin main negotiations. `` I am very much hopeful that we can go to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> when the ice on the <LOCATION> Daedong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> breaks,'' said Park, the senior South Korean delegate, referring to the river that flows through <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>. Park also expressed optimism that the two Koreas would be able to agree on an agenda at the next meeting. A three-point agenda, proposed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, called for multilateral personnel and material exchanges, the declaration of non-aggression and summit talks. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> originally had sought to sign a non-aggression pact, but had to agree to a North Korean proposal for a non-aggression declaration. <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION> maintains the two Koreas can not conclude a non-aggression pact, because they are one nation, not two separate states. Despite Park's optimism, his North Korean counterpart told a news conference after the meeting that the non-aggression declaration should consider the removal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and nuclear weapons in their arsenal. South Korean officials suspect the communist north would try to use full-scale talks to gain withdrawal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces from the south. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sees <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops as vital to its defense and the issue would stalemate any non-aggression talks. The nations have hundreds of thousands of troops poised along their 150-mile border. They have clashed repeatedly since the Korean War ended in 1953, they have no formal ties and the border is sealed. Talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been on and off since the early 1970s, but no significant progress has been made.

 Two children's safety groups announced a program Thursday to teach youngsters how to protect themselves against abuse, exploitation and abduction without unduly alarming them. The program, known as `` Kids and Company: Together for Safety,'' teaches youngsters about personal safety `` in a very upbeat way'' that bolsters their self-esteem, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, whose 6-year-old son, <PERSON> Adam </PERSON>, was abducted from a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> shopping mall and killed in 1981. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Adam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walsh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and serves on the board of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missing </ORGANIZATION> and Exploited Children, said the program teaches grade school-age youngsters how to protect themselves without frightening them. The two centers worked together to develop the program. It teaches youngsters to `` use your brain, train your body, trust your feelings and remember your friends'' in uncomfortable situations. The teaching materials include teachers' guides, a teacher training video, an in-class video, student activity sheets and a materials for parents. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that following his son's death, he and his wife, <PERSON> Reve </PERSON>, wondered `` if we had told <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> appropriate things'' about how to protect himself. `` We agonized on many occasions and said, ` Maybe we should n't have made him, or tried to make him, so polite, so much of a little gentleman,''' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said `` Maybe he'd be here today if he had better tools, if he knew he could have said no, or he could have yelled, or run.'' `` Our children have the right to have the skills and confidence they need to play an active role in their personal safety,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` Children have the right to know that they can say no.'' The program is to be launched initially in school districts in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; Marlboro, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> contributed more than $ 300,000 toward its development

Although doctors have found no signs of internal bleeding during the past week, the emperor is becoming anemic and weaker, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> told reporters. `` More often there are moments when the doctors ca n't tell if the emperor is awake or asleep,'' he said. There were no immediate plans for further blood transfusions, he said, adding that doctors were concentrating on maintaining, rather than improving, the emperor's condition. By late afternoon, <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> had a temperature of 99.9 degrees. The emperor's normal temperature is about 95.9 degrees. Palace officials have not given details on <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s illness, and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s populist party defeated the right wing in the first free election since a coup ousted her father 11 years ago, and she expressed confidence Thursday that she can form a majority coalition. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> said her <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` has emerged as the largest single party'' in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> as a result of Wednesday's parliamentary election. `` Given consultations with different groups and independent people, we are confident that we can get a simple majority,'' the 35-year-old political leader declared after arriving in this southern city for coalition talks. She would be the first woman to lead a Moslem nation. Her party captured 92 seats in the 237-member assembly, compared with 55 for the nine-party conservative <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>. The alliance includes supporters of Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, the military president killed in a plane crash three months ago. Independents and minor parties got 57 seats. Results from 13 districts were not available and 20 seats reserved for women will be filled later by vote of the assembly. The last free National Assembly election in 1977 was a landslide for Prime Minister <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and Gen. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> overthrew him soon afterward. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> was convicted of complicity in a political murder plot and hanged in 1979. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> praised <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, for the elections. Spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said: `` We congratulate the Pakistani people and their leaders for this impressive and important step in strengthening democracy in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.'' At her family home in <LOCATION> Larkana </LOCATION> earlier Thursday, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> urged President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> to give her party the mandate to form a government. She said she wouild begin coalition talks Friday, but would not name parties on the list. Likely candidates are some of her left-leaning partners in the former opposition alliance called the Movement for the <ORGANIZATION> Restoration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> also is expected to consult a relatively new party of Moslem immigrants from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> MQM </ORGANIZATION>, which carried the southern cities <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hyderabad </LOCATION>. Her personal popularity was demonstrated by the fact that she ran for three <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> seats and won them all. Two will have to be filled through by-elections. The constitution requires the president to designate a person to form a government who will be `` most likely to command the confidence of the majority of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>,'' which usually would mean the leader of the largest party. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> was asked Wednesday whether he would be reluctant to choose a woman in this male-dominated society, and he replied: `` I think a woman prime minister might be a good change.'' <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s official news agency said the president sent congratulatory telegrams to election winners but it did not mention deliberations on the choice of a prime minister. Before Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, about 5,000 supporters gathered outside the family villa in <LOCATION> Karkana </LOCATION>, dancing jubilantly and chanting: `` <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON>, prime minister!'' No major election-related violence or fraud was reported by officials through Thursday but reports of three violent deaths appeared in newspapers. Thousands policemen and soldiers patrolled <LOCATION> Sind </LOCATION>, a southern province noted for ethnic violence, on election day. Both Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> and the conservative alliance have said they would continue <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s friendship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its support of Moslem guerrillas fighting the communist government of neighboring <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Although Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> also said she would pursue <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s program of increasing the influence of Islam in the nation's life, she pledged not to let the religious policy interfere with the rights women and minorities. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> attended both <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> and is considered Westernized. She lived in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for several years while <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was in power. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled by martial law for eight years after the coup, then held national elections 1985 in which political parties were not permitted to enter candidates. Mrs. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s party and others in the opposition boycotted the elections. The general dismissed the government and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in May on grounds of corruption, incompetence and delay in putting <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> under Islamic law. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> called Wednesday's election before the plane crash Aug. 17 in which he, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador and 28 other people were killed.

 A judge ruled Thursday that some leaders of the nation's biggest anti-apartheid group committed treason by inciting violence during township unrest in 1984, a crime punishable by death. The judge did not say which of the 16 defendants were guilty of treason. He acquitted three other defendants in the case, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s longest-running political trial. It began in June 1985. <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Kees </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON>'s decision was contained in a 1,521-page summary, which the judge began reading three days ago. Verdicts against individuals may not be announced until next week. The three best-known defendants are senior leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> who have been held 40 months without bail: <PERSON> Popo </PERSON> <PERSON> Molefe </PERSON>, 36, who was the coalition's national secretary; <LOCATION> Terror </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lekota </LOCATION>, 40, who was its chief spokesman; and <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, 40, a leader of its <ORGANIZATION> Transvaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> branch. Those acquitted Thursday were the Rev. <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Motselane </PERSON>, 41; <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlomuka </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Baleka </PERSON>, 29. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, banned in February, was formed in 1983 to mobilize opposition to a new constitution that excluded the black majority from representation in Parliament. All 19 defendants pleaded innocent to charges of treason, terrorism, murder and subversion related to allegations the Front and its affiliates incited violence when unrest broke out in black townships in 1984. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> said that because violence was an intended facet of the uprising in the townships, the state had proved the crime of treason. The charges of murder, which also carry a possible death penalty, relate to the mob killings of black town councilors during the Vaal Triangle rioting. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> said one of the defendants, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Manthatha </PERSON>, urged residents in the area to kill councilors. He also said the <ORGANIZATION> Vaal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Front affiliate to which several defendants belonged, encouraged confrontational protests that sparked rioting. The Front grew into the largest opposition group in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, encompassing more than 600 affiliated groups with about 2 million members. Most of its leaders are in detention, in hiding or barred from political activity. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> accepted the prosecutors' allegation that the group was supported and guided by the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main anti-government guerrilla movement. Front leaders maintained they endorsed the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s political goals, such as a one-person, one-vote system, but did not advocate the use of violence. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dijkhorst </PERSON> has presided over the non-jury trial since its start and has sole responsibility for the verdict and sentencing. There originally were 22 defendants in the trial, conducted for many months in the town of <LOCATION> Delmas </LOCATION> before being shifted to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. Three men were acquitted in 1986.

<HEAD>U.S. Rice Official Assails `Evil Empire'' of Japanese Agriculture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s refusal to import <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice is the work of an `` evil empire'' of cooperatives manipulating its agricultural scene, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` -LRB- It -RRB- is a fantastic example of economic distortion and it basically stinks,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON>, president of the group of rice producers in six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states. He said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could start to ease much of what he sees as its social problems by liberaling its strictly controlled rice market. In October, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government rejected a petition by the <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> complaining about <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ban on rice imports. But it noted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s policy contravened trade agreements. <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> reserved his sharpest attack for the network of agricultural cooperatives that are powerful political lobbyists with huge economic resources. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rice policy, <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> said, `` is tied to a cooperative framework which I would characterize as basically an evil empire.'' The cooperative movement is supposed to help Japanese farmers and consumers, but `` it exploits farmers and gouges consumers,'' he claimed. He said the cooperatives had mounted an expensive lobbying effort in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice exports, resulting in what he saw as some `` jaw-droppers'' in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> news reports and editorials saying <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> should not press <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to open its sacrosanct rice market. After laborious negotiations earlier this year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed to accept more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and oranges, but firmly rejected calls to open its rice market. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s staple food and the government policy is to keep self-sufficiency in rice, though it requires massive subsidies to farmers and retail prices more than triple those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We should n't have any sacred or cultural cows in trade relationships,'' <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> said. `` These kinds of sensitivities should not be reasons for avoiding confronting trade issues.'' Rice in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> costs $ 3.85 for 2.2 pounds, compared with $ 1 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 122 million people consume about 10.3 million tons of rice a year. The government subsidy last year, including some payments to keep paddy fields idle, was $ 3.6 billion. <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> proposed a gradual opening of 2.5 percent a year of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rice market over a four-year period. Ten percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rice market would be as much as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> growers could produce, he said <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> said he was aiming for $ 300 million worth of the Japanese rice market. He said American farmers can deliver milled rice at 400 dollars a ton versus $ 2,500 a ton in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. If <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> liberalizes its market, he predicted that Japanese farmers would become more efficient, that land and housing prices would go down because some paddy land would be freed for housing, and that Japanese consumers could spend less on agricultural products and more on manufactured imports, thus further helping the country reduce its huge trade surplus.

<TEXT>
 A former Nazi was acquitted Thursday of complicity in the murder of 177 French Jews sent to <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, a verdict that drew shouts of `` Nazi murderer!'' from victims' relatives and spectators Count Modest <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> was accused of ordering the deportations of Jews from the <LOCATION> Chalons-sur-Marne </LOCATION> region of northeastern <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where he served as <ORGANIZATION> Gestapo </ORGANIZATION> chief in 1942 and 1943. State Court Judge <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lickfett </PERSON> said the five-member panel decided there was insufficient evidence to tie <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> to the deaths of 177 people he was accused of deporting. `` The proceedings were interrupted by shouts of ` Nazi murderer!' and ` this is a Nazi court!''' said a court spokeswoman, <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakosek-Ruehling </PERSON>. <PERSON> Korff </PERSON>, 79, left the courtroom after the verdict was read and could not immediately be reached for comment. Phone calls to his home in the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> suburb of Koenigswinter were not answered. During the trial, <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> claimed he did not know about the extermination of Jews when he served as <ORGANIZATION> Gestapo </ORGANIZATION> chief in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The Nazis killed an estimated 6 million Jews during their rule from 1933 to 1945. Ms. <PERSON> Zakosek-Ruehling </PERSON> said the defendant showed no emotion during announcement of the verdict or the outbursts from spectators who packed the small courtroom in central <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. The panel was composed of two jurors and three judges. About 20 French relatives of <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> victims were among the spectators, as well as French <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> hunter <PERSON> Serge </PERSON> <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON>. Spectators said the French spectators included relatives of those whom <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> was accused of deporting. <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON> led prosecutors to <PERSON> Korff </PERSON>. <PERSON> Klarsfeld </PERSON> and the others who had traveled from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> stormed out of the courtroom to show their disapproval of the verdict, Ms. <PERSON> Zakosek-Ruehling </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Until his retirement in the early 1970s, <PERSON> Korff </PERSON> served as a ministerial adviser with the West German <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. He was free during the trial, which began in September 1987. The acquittal follows a period of extreme sensitivity over <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> past after last week's 50th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> thugs destroyed Jewish homes and businesses and beat up Jews. Jewish community leaders were outraged by a speech in which <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Philipp </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON> referred to the early Nazi years as `` glorious'' in an attempt to explain <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s initial appeal to the German public. <PERSON> Jenninger </PERSON>, a member of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s Christian Democrat party, was forced to resign the next day. There have also been a number of desecrations of Jewish monuments and cemeteries reported after the Kristallnacht observances.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today named <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> as his White House chief of staff and announced campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as his choice to head the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The selection of <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> prompted a decision by long-time aide <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> to leave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s service. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> had served as the vice president's chief of staff and made it clear he wanted the powerful White House post. `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> has the background and experience necessary to work not only with his former colleagues in the nation's statehouses but also to build a constructive relationship with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said the outgoing three-term governor's background as an engineer, college professor, small businessman and governor `` will bring a refreshing new perspective that in my view is critical. He is the right man in the job.'' `` I'm eager to take up the challenge. It is going to be a very important few years,'' the new chief of staff told reporters. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s selection appeared to fuel the departure of Fuller. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in October that `` I wanted to return to the private sector.'' But he said he also told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during that conversation that `` obviously, I would be eager'' to serve as chief of staff, often called the second most powerful position in the White House. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s vice presidential chief of staff since 1985, said he will resign when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition is completed in January. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, credited with engineering <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary win, brings to the job a reputation as an aggressive, hands-on manager. His appointment cheered conservatives, but worried some on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> as well as Jewish leaders. He was the only one of 50 governors who refused to back a statement denouncing a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> resolution that equated Zionism with racism. He said he would remain governor through his term, which ends Jan. 5. But he said he would continue to consult with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s transition team As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was certain to be elected to succeed <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> is a 48-year-old <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> lawyer whose seven years in the post make him the longest-serving <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chief in this century. `` I expect the party to move forward and grow. I will strongly recommend to members of the national committee <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to become the chairman,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, describing <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as a master of grassroots politics. `` He's a friend; I'm proud of his accomplishments,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the man who helped orchestrate his presidential victory. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, 37, is a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native who earlier served as an aide to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and also worked for Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. After the 1984 election, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> became a partner in the lobbying firm of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manafort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Stone. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> was asked whether he would have trouble in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, given that he has never worked for the federal government and given his blunt-spoken, aggressive nature. `` I'm a pussycat,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` Let me tell you about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Certainly I have a lot to learn in regard to the details. I think I'm a quick learner. I consider a great number of congressmen to be close friends, both Democratic and Republican.'' As to the criticism by Jewish leaders for refusing to endorse the governors' proclamation on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who is partly of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> descent, said: `` I'm very sensitive to that issue. The problem I had as a governor is that I felt it was inappropriate. In terms of the issue, I have no problem saying it should be repudiated.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, 49, had declined to run for a fourth term, citing a need to return to `` the real world to get a real job.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, have eight children. He is credited with helping revive <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy with a win in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary last February after the vice president finished a poor third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses

<TEXT>
 A Swiss representative of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> was kidnapped Thursday in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, and police said his captors might intend to swap him for an aircaft hijacker held in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> blamed the abduction on emenies trying to discredit its newly proclaimed state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. No organization claimed responsibility. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appealed for the immediate release of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, 32, and said: `` The <ORGANIZATION> ICRC </ORGANIZATION> can not accomplish its mission unless it remains sheltered from all forms of pressure, wherever their origin.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Joerg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bischof </PERSON> said other representatives had been kidnapped in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but were released after a few hours. Fourteen other foreigners, including nine Americans, are missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, most believed to be in the hands of Shiite Moslem extremists loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985. Police said <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> was taken from his car at 8:45 a.m. in <LOCATION> Hisbeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They mentioned unconfirmed reports that <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, who had been in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> only a month, was taken to the Palestinian refugee camp <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Hilweh </PERSON>. They also theorized the motive might be to trade <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, for <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, the Lebanese Shiite Moslem hijacker held in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, 22, commandeered an Air Afrique jetliner on a flight from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and forced it to land in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on July 24, 1987. He killed a French passenger before the crew overpowered him. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>'s relatives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said at the time he belonged to the Shiite fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella group for most of the kidnappers holding foreigners. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and local militia officials said radical Palestinians may have kidnapped <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> to pressure <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> not to recognize the independent state proclaimed in the Israeli-occupied territories by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> legislature. Hard-line groups backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> opposed the declaration because it involved acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions that implicitly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Six hours after the Thursday's kidnapping, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes made mock attacks on Palestinian refugee camps on the southern fringe of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Israeli jets have buzzed the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> camps daily since <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, announced the new state Tuesday at a council meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Police said an olive-colored car without license plates, carrying three men, passed and stopped <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s car at a main traffic circle. Two gunmen pulled <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> from the front passenger seat, keeping their weapons pointed at his head. They pushed him into the back seat of their car and the third assailant drove it away. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> did not resist and was not beaten, said a police spokesman. <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Assaad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s Lebanese driver, was left behind and reported the abduction. `` Panicky onlookers made no move to help,'' the spokesman said. `` The kidnapping was carried out in less than one minute. There was no shooting.'' <PERSON> Assaad </PERSON> said none of the kidnappers was masked and the only one wearing a beard was blond, with curly hair, dressed in dark blue trousers and a black leather jacket. `` The bearded one shouted ` Out, out quickly!' Mr. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> obeyed. It was a very rapid operation,'' he said. <PERSON> Christophe </PERSON> <PERSON> Girod </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, held a 45-minute meeting in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> with a representative of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla group headed by Palestinian terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>. `` We discussed the abduction. We hope he will released quickly,'' <PERSON> Girod </PERSON> said, but would not elaborate. Representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> are assigned abroad to monitor compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> conventions and help organize humanitarian relief. Swiss Ambassador <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Sciolli </PERSON> said 30 work in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nasserite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> militia in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, who would not let his name be used, said: `` It appears the abduction has been carried out by radical Palestinians who regard the declaration of the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> a capitulation, a renunciation of the armed struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' The militia, a leftist Sunni Moslem group, has controlled <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> since the outbreak of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s sectarian civil war in 1975. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s representative in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Salem </PERSON>, said: `` This is an action against the recent declaration of the state of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> is the fifth foreigner working for a humanitarian organization either kidnapped or missing in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in nine months. A Swede and a Norwegian working for the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> were kidnapped Feb. 5 and freed 25 days later. A British charity worker seized March 3 was held six days and a Belgian physician working for an aid committee disappeared May 21, but no group has claimed to have kidnapped him.

 When it comes to guessing who's going to be in the new Cabinet, the word from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not `` read my lips'' but `` stay tuned.'' He's also sworn his transition staff to secrecy, but that has n't put a dent in the production of the rumor mills. They keep pouring forth endless lists of Cabinet possibilities, fed by what seems like every Republican politician in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, plus assorted Democrats, bureaucrats, pundits, self-promoters and other <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> idlers. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s all-purpose answer to the speculation is `` stay tuned.'' That's what he said Thursday morning, just a few hours before he introduced New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> as White House chief of staff and announced that campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was his choice to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Two Cabinet seats already have been taken -LRB- State and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, leaving the president-elect with a dozen other department heads to name.

 The man whose tip led to the arrest of a woman suspected in the deaths of seven boardinghouse residents says he's not really glad to have put someone in jail but feels `` like I'm a good citizen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> says he was befriended by the pleasant, gray-haired woman whom he met in a bar, but he became suspicious because of her interest in his disability checks and her suggestion that they live together. <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> was arrested late Wednesday and was being held by police in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> for investigation of murdering seven tenants found buried in shallow graves outside the Victorian boardinghouse she ran there. Police believe <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> killed the tenants for their Social Security checks. It was <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON>, 67, who lives alone in a downtown apartment here and draws Social Security and other disability checks, who tipped a <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> editor and then police Wednesday to <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>'s whereabouts in a motel near a bar where they had met earlier in the day. He did n't immediately recognize her when he talked with her in the bar, but he realized later that he had seen her face from a morning newscast on CBS. `` I'm not really happy about putting somebody in jail,'' <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I am happy in a way, though. I believe in justice. I feel like I'm a good citizen.'' He said <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> seemed pleasant when they met at the bar, an out-of-towner in need of a friend. She told <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> she was from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and was looking for a place to repair her shoes. `` I took her shoes across the street to a shoe repair place. And that's how the whole thing got started,'' <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> said. She told him she was an only child, that her husband died a month ago, and that the cab driver who took her to her motel stole her luggage, <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> said. `` She seemed nice and sincere,'' he said. But he said she had a strange interest in his disability checks. And after only one meeting she started talking about living together. `` I did n't exactly agree to that. I said we should talk about it tomorrow. We were going to go shopping,'' he said. When he got home, the woman's face would n't leave him. `` I said to myself that I know this woman. I've seen her before,'' he said. Then he remembered and called the local <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> bureau, and with the help of assignment editor <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON>, <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> found out who his mystery woman was. `` I was n't just going for the scoop,'' <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said later. `` This woman could have been trying to prey on him. He was disabled and drawing a pension. It became more than just a story. It became a concern for somebody's life.'' Silver went to <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON>' apartment and the two of them looked at a newspaper photo of the woman and watched a newscast of the story about the buried bodies. They decided to call police, said Silver. Another elderly man who knew <PERSON> Puentes </PERSON> said Wednesday that he may have unwittingly helped dig the graves in the boardinghouse lawn. `` I was just doing favors for <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON>. She was always asking us to do things for her,'' said <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 74. He said she told him the holes were for a tree or for garbage. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said he lived at <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON>'s boardinghouse for two years, but moved out last week after refusing to sign over his checks to her. `` I feel real lucky just to be here talking,'' he said. `` I guess I could have ended up in one of those holes I dug.'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said boardinghouse tenants seldom exchanged more than a few words and assembled together only for meals twice a day. Sometimes boarders disappeared, `` but folks were always coming and going,'' he said. `` Nothing unusual about that.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced the expulsion of an Iraqi diplomat in retaliation for the `` unjustified'' ouster of an American diplomat in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>. But spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> stressed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to improve relations with the Arab country. `` There are mutual interests,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> were restored by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984 after a 17-year break. Some analysts detected a trend toward moderation in the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> party. The ousted American was identified Thursday in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Heywood </PERSON> <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s political section who has since left the country. Diplomats in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital said he had made an unauthorized trip to the north, home of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s estimated 3.5 million Kurds. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official here, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the trip had been approved by the Iraqis. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year criticized <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s treatment of the non-Arab minority and accused <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> of using chemical weapons against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war Without identifying <PERSON> Rankin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said `` none of his activities have been incompatible in any way with his diplomatic status.'' He declined to say whether the American had met with the Kurds. However, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said he did not know of any restrictions on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contacts. The spokesman called the expulsion `` a serious matter'' and said in retaliation Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> had informed the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> ambassador, <PERSON> Abdul-Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Anbari </PERSON>, that an Iraqi diplomat assigned to the embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had been declared `` persona non grata.'' `` This action was taken in response to the unjustified expulsion of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government,'' the spokesman said. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> declined to identify the Iraqi or his job. Efforts to reach the embassy by telephone were unsuccessful. About 60,000 Kurds fled across the northern border to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and thousands of others went into <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in August, claiming <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> dropped chemical bombs on their villages. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had substantiated the accusations. Militants among the 20 million Kurds living in a region extending into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> have fought for independence for the past century. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> attacked Kurdish settlements on its northwestern border shortly after accepting an Aug. 20 cease-fire in its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Kurdish guerrillas received support from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the war. Congress considered imposing economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, based on <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports it was using chemical weapons against its Kurdish minority. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> denied the use, and the legislation was dropped in the rush to adjourn <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before the November <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential election.

<HEAD>Earthlings Talk, but Is Anyone Out There Listening?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Earth to aliens, Earth to aliens, are you listening? OK, get this. You're welcome to visit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, maybe check out a basketball game or two, but make sure you bring plenty of cash -LRB- there are some great real estate deals you would n't want to miss -RRB-. That, in part, is what earthlings had to say to their extraterrestrial neighbors Thursday when <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T gave people an opportunity to direct dial the rest of the universe. The company set up a camera and microphone outside its <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> headquarters and began recording about 30 hours of videotaped messages that will be beamed via satellite into outer space sometime between Thanksgiving and New Year's. Passers-by were encouraged to step up and sound off, so long as they were n't obscene. The idea was to let those aliens _ if they're out there, if they're intelligent and if they get good TV reception _ know we're here The extraterrestrials might want to know, for instance, the news that 13-year-old <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> was anxious to communicate to the void: `` I hope you saw the Knicks versus the Bullets. Because the <ORGANIZATION> Knicks </ORGANIZATION> won.'' Or this message from 24-year-old <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Franz </PERSON>, a Madison Avenue real estate agent: `` I have this great real estate investment here, but I need $ 25,000. If you're interested, give me a call.'' <PERSON> Alistair </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, a 9-year-old visitor from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was friendly: `` Life on earth is great here. I hope you have a nice time invading us.'' <PERSON> Kiernan </PERSON> <PERSON> Varas </PERSON>, 13, an eighth-grade classmate of <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> School, was thoughtful: `` I hope the quest for knowledge lasts forever.'' And another classmate, 13-year-old <PERSON> Lisette </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazu </PERSON>, was poignant: `` Hello, my name is <PERSON> Lisette </PERSON>. I'm deaf but I would like to hear from you.'' The search for extraterrestrial life is nothing new, as <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T officials are quick to admit. Scientists have sent messages for aliens into space before, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> funds a project, the Search for <ORGANIZATION> Extraterrestrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, that is devoted to hunting for signals from beyond. Furthermore, normal radio and television signals are escaping into space all the time, setting out on theoretically infinite voyages that could someday bring reruns of `` Mr. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON>'' into living rooms in another galaxy. Given all that, what's the point of adding to the intergalactic information glut? Former astronaut <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, now a private consultant who was hired by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T to appear at the space message promotion, had an answer. `` I think the fundamental problem of trying to communicate with other parts of the universe is that the universe is just so large and covers such a time span ... that any effort to send a message out is worthwhile,'' he said. `` Any time you add to the sum total of information going out, I think that's a worthwhile effort.'' Is there intelligent life out there? `` I think the prospects are good,'' <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said. `` I think if you look out there and count the number of stars and then begin making the most pessimistic assumptions, you still have to conclude that there are trillions and trillions of stars as suitable as our own for sustaining life. I think it's a form of cosmic conceit to think that we're the only planet in the entire vast universe which has been successful in that regard.'' In other words, as 12-year-old <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maldonado </PERSON> said, there's `` a pretty good chance. We ca n't tell if there is something else out there and we ca n't tell if there's not.''

<HEAD>City's Christmas Decorations Tainted By Asbestos Dust</HEAD>
<DATELINE>McALESTER, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It could be a dark Christmas this year because the city's holiday decorations have been contaminated in storage by asbestos dust. The pole decorations normally hung along <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkway </PERSON> were stored in the old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> center, which the city's parks departments has used for storage. An inspection this year revealed old insulation was releasing potentially hazardous asbestos particles into the air. Asbestos has been identified as a potential cancer-causing substance when inhaled. The building was closed and crews were able to remove and clean street signs in the building. But <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said cleaning the lights would require more labor than they are worth. `` The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> offered to pay half of the $ 5,000 replacement costs for new decorations, but no one has offered to match the city's expense for the project,'' <PERSON> Priddy </PERSON> said. `` I would say right now, the city is looking toward next year, not this one,'' he said, adding that even with the money, there might not be time to buy decorations for this year. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> McAlester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> director of maintenance, is licensed to handle asbestos, but he said the decorations may be a lost cause. `` We had to have special permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> to remove the other items and they have said no more,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 When Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> heard that <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> had abruptly resigned as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s chief of staff, he put in a quick telephone call to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, I think you better get over to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he told the former <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator who was in line to succeed <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>. `` There's no one in charge.'' The story, told by former <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, speaks volumes about the key role played in the modern White House by an official unheard of a few decades ago. Attention is focused on the job again by President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement Thursday that he is naming outgoing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> to the post. `` The job of chief of staff requires the ability to lead, to motivate, to direct an important organization in the best interests of the country,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in making the announcement. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said, `` My principal responsibilities will be to make sure that the new president gets the information and the tools that he needs to make the policies that dicate the programs that will go forth from the White House. I am also very aware that once those policies are made I have a responsibility to try and get them implemented as effectively as they can.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said the key to how he operates as chief of staff will be `` the way the vice president, once he becomes president, wants the White House run.'' In dealing with domestic policy issues, he said, `` I have two responsibilities. One is to be an honest broker and present the views on the various sides of the issue, and after I fulfill that, then I have the opportunity to indicate my recommendations.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> will be the second former governor to hold the position. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was a former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader. <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> was a former treasury secretary. Yet the post of chief of staff is not even mentioned in the Constitution, and no president had one until <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> general, came to the White House growling, `` Do I have to be my own sergeant major?'' Most people would think that even without <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, or for that matter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, there is somebody in charge at the White House: the president. `` Of course, he is in charge,'' said <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, who has observed the process both as an adviser to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and as a senior aide to President <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. However, he added, `` Given the size and complexity of problems in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> now, you ca n't run a good administration without a first-rate chief of staff.'' Does this make the staff chief a glorified clerk, or possibly the second most powerful official in the government? Depends on how you look at it, but closer to the second than the first. `` Constitutionally he is and has to be the president's mere dogsbody, to borrow a British term,'' presidential scholar <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Neustadt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> wrote in a 1986 study of the chief of staff. The Oxford English Dictionary defines `` dogsbody'' as `` a junior person, especially one to whom a variety of menial tasks is given.'' Do n't kid yourself. The White House chief of staff is nobody's dogsbody `` The chief of staff is system manager _ the boss of none but the quarterback of everything,'' former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> writes in a new book on the White House staff, `` The Ring of Power.'' `` He is anything but a pencil pusher,'' said Cannon. If there is a tornado in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> or a crisis in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, word of it comes to the chief of staff, who is on call at all hours of the day or night. `` A chief of staff's power thus derives from his ability to schedule the president's time, allocate access to him, and shape his agenda,'' <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Popkin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> wrote in the 1986 study. After <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>'s abrupt resignation, said <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, `` it would have been awkward if something very serious had happened somewhere in the country or the world, and there was no chief of staff in the White House.'' The role of the chief of staff varies, however, from administration to administration. Presidents <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> chose not to have such functionaries, although other aides filled much the same role. <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> returned to having a chief of staff and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> followed suit. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> first favored a `` spokes of the wheel'' approach, in which various assistants reported directly to him, but abandoned it and made <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> chief of staff. Discussing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff chief, <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said, `` I think probably he will have less power relatively than the present chief of staff because <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s style was to turn over more decisions to the chief of staff. ... My feeling is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have more decisions in his own hands and less in the hands of the chief of staff.'' And what of <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide who headed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s staff through most of his second term as vice president? He was in the running for White House chief of staff, but was passed over and reportedly was being considered for a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post instead. He declined the consolation prize before it was offered, announcing Thursday that he would have been happy to be chief of staff but now plans to return to private life.

 The collapse of one of the world's largest radiotelescopes will hinder astronomy over the long term and will even hamper an experiment planned for an upcoming space shuttle mission, experts say The dish-shaped radiotelescope at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which crashed Tuesday night, was as wide as a football field is long but built on a shoestring budget 26 years ago. It was capable of listening to objects 10 billion light years away. `` It's a major blow. There's no way to deny that,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Seielstad </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NRAO </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant director at the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> operations. <PERSON> Seielstad </PERSON> said the telescope's loss will affect a long list of research proposals, including a future space shuttle project. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Gamma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to be launched by <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in 1990 from the space shuttle, and one of the things they will look for will be pulse signals,'' he said. `` We were going to use this telescope to monitor 100 of the brightest pulsars in conjunction with the Gamma Ray observations.'' He said no other telescope can take over such work. `` We're shocked,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Backer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> astronomer who is doing pulsar research at a sister observatory in <LOCATION> Arecibo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` We'll miss it. `` I'm sure a lot of operators of big dishes elsewhere across the world are going to go out next week or tomorrow morning and check what they never checked before.'' Backer, who used <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>'s 300-foot radiotelescope last year to search for pulsars, said it long ago exceeded its expected lifespan. It was built for $ 850,000 in 1962. Engineers from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which funds <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for a consortium of nine universities, flew to the site Wednesday in an attempt to discover what caused the dish to topple. <PERSON> Seielstad </PERSON> said the telescope's 600 tons of metal dropped to the ground without warning Tuesday night. The twin steel towers upon which the structure moved were twisted and snapped. White aluminum mesh panels that once made up the dish blanketed the rubble like an umbrella pushed inside-out. `` It looks so much like someone lifted a big bowl into the air and let it drop,'' <PERSON> Seielstad </PERSON> said. The unidentified employee operating the radiotelescope said there was no warning, <PERSON> Seielstad </PERSON> said. Workers said the structure routinely snapped and popped, especially as it cooled at night, but that it had survived heavy snows, thunderstorms and 75 mph winds. Weather was calm Tuesday night when the scope tumbled to the ground, workers said. The radiotelescope was capable of intercepting naturally emitted radio signals from celestial bodies billions of light years away. Its most celebrated contribution to science came in 1968, when astronomers used it to discover a pulsar at the center of the Crab Nebula. The find helped prove that pulsars are the dense remains of supernovae, or exploded stars. The observatory, which opened in 1959, has eight smaller telescopes, the smallest 40 feet in diameter. <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is located in the <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> about 10 miles from the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> border.

<HEAD>Panel Says Reducing Demand Key To Curbing Drug Flows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A panel of leading Mexicans and Americans recommended Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> give top priority to curbing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demand for drugs as part of a more balanced policy in dealing with that problem. The recommendation was contained in a lengthy study by the <ORGANIZATION> Bilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Future of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> States-Mexican Relations on five areas of concern between the two countries. The commission was co-chaired by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who held two senior <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> posts during the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration, and <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Margain </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> who is a former ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 238-page study said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has placed excessive emphasis on law enforcement to curb drug smuggling and that recent increases in funding levels to reduce demand for drugs will prove inadequate. `` The commission urges the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to give top priority to learning how to reduce demand and to allocate sufficient resources to move rapidly in attacking this critical problem,'' the report said. `` A balanced strategy must also include a vigorous international effort, in which drug control concerns are given high diplomatic priority,'' it said. It suggested that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government subordinated the drug issue in its relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> because priority was given to security concerns. `` Such obviously selective application of its international narcotics control policy undermines <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credibility with other countries and with the multilateral institutions pledged to combat drug abuse,'' the report said. Release of the report was timed to coincide with the advent of new administrations in both <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mexican President-elect <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> will be inaugurated on Dec. 1, seven weeks before his <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> counterpart, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> told a news conference that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> `` stands second only to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in its significance to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>'' Copies of the report were delivered to Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. The report also covered such issues as economics, migration, foreign policy and education. Following are excerpts: Debt _ `` For <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> ... debt service obligations in the future should be designed subject to -LRB- its -RRB- capacity to pay under conditions of growth. Without growth, adjustment will not be sustained; without growth, resources for debt service will not be available.'' Trade _ `` Both countries should continue to agree to generalized trade concessions. They should move promptly to free-trade agreements in all sectors where benefits from free trade may exist, especially industrial sectors.'' Migration _ `` Both governments ... should undertake to reach a bilateral accord on migration, which should consider: a possible increase in the legal quotas of Mexican migration to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, an agreement on the flow and treatment of ` seasonal agricultural workers,' the protection of migrants' human and labor rights and the possibility of a long-run temporary worker program.'' Foreign Policy _ `` A first step is to initiate a frank and open dialogue on the concept of regional security. The commission believes that regional security involves not only military-strategic concerns but must also encompass questions of socio-economic development.'' Other commission members included former <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Colegio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Federal Aid to Local, State Governments Lowest Since 1966</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State and local government reliance on federal aid last year sank to its lowest level in more than 20 years, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. From a high of 18.7 cents per dollar of state and local government revenue in 1978, the federal contribution withered to 13.6 cents in 1987. It was the lowest since 1966, when <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was gearing up the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> programs and the federal contribution was 13.5 cents per dollar. Total federal aid actually has risen throughout the period _ from $ 70 billion in 1978, to $ 113 billion in 1986 to $ 115 billion in 1987. But it is increasing at a slower rate than other state and local government revenues. While the federal contribution grew at an average of 5.7 percent a year from 1978 to 1987, the amount raised by state and local taxes grew an average of 8.5 percent a year. Last year, state and local taxes grew 8.6 percent to $ 405.1 billion, while federal aid increased only 1.7 percent. Revenue from all sources totaled $ 842.6 billion. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wulf </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said the federal share likely will slip again in future years because state and local governments will be increasing spending to upgrade `` infrastructure'' items such as sewers and roads. <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION>, said the trend is disturbing because the bulk of state and local taxes, based either on sales or real estate, are more regressive than the federal sliding scale for income taxes. Also, he said, `` The significance of these reductions goes beyond the numbers in that the results have been felt most severely in those communities where needs are already the greatest.'' `` The fact is when a region is distressed, whether it is the Oil Patch now or the Great Lakes Rust Belt earlier in the decade, it has much less capacity to generate revenues,'' he said. <PERSON> Arndt </PERSON> said federal assistance began declining in the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> administration as part of an effort to fight inflation. It continued to decline in administration of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, first as part of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` new federalism'' shifting many government functions to the local level and second as part of the effort to reduce the federal budget deficit. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, state and local government spending grew 8.1 percent last year to $ 775.3 billion, up $ 57.9 billion, compared with a 9.1 percent rise a year earlier. Average growth in spending since 1978 has been 11 percent. Topping the spending list were education, $ 227 billion -LRB- 29.3 cents per dollar spent -RRB-; public welfare, $ 83 billion -LRB- 10.7 cents -RRB-; publicly owned utilities, $ 66 billion -LRB- 8.5 cents -RRB-; and highways, $ 52 billion -LRB- 6.7 cents -RRB-. Salaries and wages accounted for 35.4 percent of state and local government spending, but increased at a slightly slower rate, 6.9 percent, than overall spending. Outstanding state debt also increased, up 9.1 percent to $ 718.7 billion.

<HEAD>Nearly $2 Million Paid For Kafka's `Trial'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The handwritten manuscript of <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s `` The Trial,'' which was smuggled to safety during World War II despite the author's dying wish that it be burned, sold for a record $ 1.98 million Thursday. The 316-page text of the novel, which came to symbolize 20th-century totalitarianism, was bought at auction by the German state government of <LOCATION> Baden-Wuerttemberg </LOCATION> for 1.1 million pounds. <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>, a Czechoslovak Jew, completed the novel in 1920 and it was published in 1925, a year after he died from tuberculosis at age 41. The novel's hero, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON>, who has done nothing wrong, is arrested, tried and executed without ever being told of what he is accused. The novel's terrifying account of K.'s entrapment in judicial bureaucracy gave the word `` Kafkaesque'' to the language. <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> gave his manuscripts in 1924 to <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Brod </PERSON>, who ignored the writer's orders to burn them and fled with the works to Palestine the night the German army entered <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in 1938. <PERSON> Brod </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s literary executor, died in 1968 A spokesman for the state government in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> said the manuscript would probably go to the German Literature Archives in <LOCATION> Marbach </LOCATION>. `` We want it in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> wrote it in German, and because it is the most important novel of our century,'' said the successful bidder, antiquarian bookseller <PERSON> Heribert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Rotthalmunster </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. `` I would have bought it for myself and paid double what I did, but our authorities contacted me to buy it. I would have gone to 2 or 3 million pounds,'' <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON> told reporters outside <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s saleroom The 40-year-old bookseller, a previous buyer of medieval manuscripts in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, added: `` It is definitely a very good deal, a bargain. For such a work, one has to be prepared to pay. `` I hope there will be a lot of happiness in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> about this purchase, especially at this price.'' The seller was not identified. <PERSON> Brod </PERSON> left his papers to his secretary and companion, <PERSON> Ester </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffe </PERSON>. When <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON> was asked if Ms. <PERSON> Hoffe </PERSON> was the seller, he hesitated and then said he could n't discuss that. Auctioneer <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davids </PERSON> started the bidding at 400,000 pounds, or $ 720,000, and ended it one minute later, with <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON> and another person bidding in $ 90,000 increments. Asked if he knew who the other bidder was, <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON> said: `` I was n't interested in underbidders _ I was determined to get it. I knew I would get it.'' The final bid was exactly 1 million pounds, but the auctioneers add a 10 percent commission. The price was an auction record for any modern literary transcript. Auctioneers define `` modern'' as anything written since the Middle Ages, a historians' loose term for the 5th to 15th centuries. The price eclipsed the $ 605,000 paid in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> last year for <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s letters to his fiancee, <PERSON> Felice </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, and the previous record for a purely literary work, the 275,000 pounds, about $ 370,000, paid in July 1985 for a notebook of poetry and prose by Irish writer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeats </PERSON>. `` What makes ` The Trial' even more valuable is that <PERSON> Brod </PERSON> left his own manuscripts in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to put <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s in his suitcase,'' <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON> said he will pay for the manuscript when he returns to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Dec. 6, the two-week delay needed for British authorities to issue an export license. `` Poor old <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>, he died broke,'' commented a reporter. `` Yes,'' said <PERSON> Tenschert </PERSON>, `` and my wife said if I bought ` The Trial' I should burn it because <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON> wanted that. `` Well, if it was my money buying it I would consider that, but I ca n't because someone else is paying.''

<HEAD>Experiments, Envelopes Carried On Small Research Rocket</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 30-pound package carrying four experiments and 52 envelopes rocketed 14,000 feet high and was recovered despite parachute failure Thursday in what was touted as the first private commercial space flight. A 10-foot rocket not much bigger than those launched by weekend hobbyists burned for 4.4 seconds as it propelled the payload over a five-minute course, dropping it into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> two miles offshore. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> E'Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported the main parachute did not open but that a smaller pilot chute did work and was sufficient to land the payload safely. Divers recovered it in good condition. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mizell </PERSON>, E'Prime operations director, said a flight monitoring experiment to measure acceleration and temperatures failed to operate during the flight but that the other experiments went well. He reported slight water seepage into the payload section. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Havekotte </PERSON>, a space stamp enthusiast, said some of the envelopes, bearing covers commemorating the flight, got damp, but they were dried out and most were mailed to collectors. E'Prime, of nearby <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>, hopes the success will lead to investor interest in the company so it eventually can buy bigger rockets capable to orbiting commercial space payloads. Stockholders and potential investors were among the 200 people who watched the liftoff from the beach, half a mile from the launch pad. In trying to attract investors, E'Prime billed the flight as the `` first truly commercial space flight.'' But by the company's own definition, space starts 75 miles up. And <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has launched several commercial payloads for paying customers over the years. However, it was the first time a privately owned rocket had been launched from either <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> facilities here. The company paid the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> $ 24,000 for use of of an old weather rocket launch pad and some support services. It also had to buy $ 1 million in liability insurance to cover any damage to <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> property. <PERSON> Mizell </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineer, said the experiments on board the rocket were from paying customers. He declined to say how much they had paid except that it was not enough to make the flight profitable. A high school teacher whose class developed one of the experiments said they paid $ 5. He estimated the total the fledgling company has spent so far at $ 200,000. The so-called `` commercialization of space,'' to bring the private sector into the launching of satellites and other space activity, has been a major goal of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Mizell </PERSON> said his company has a long way to go before it can become a viable provider of commercial launch services for space payloads. He noted that Thursday's flight had been delayed a year while the company met the government's financial, safety and techncial requirements. He said E'Prime hopes to launch a second rocket of the same size early next year. The flight Thursday was called LOFT-1, for Launch Operations Flight Test. The rocket carried a biology experiment from a <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, high school; a thin-film polymer experiment from <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; the flight monitoring system for measuring acceleration and temperature from <ORGANIZATION> QSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Weber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>; and a data collection and telemetry system from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, a teacher at J.O. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, said the biology experiment involved sending plant seeds into space. They will be planted and their growth rates compared with those of other seeds.

 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> panels set up in the wake of last year's prison riots by Mariel boatlift detainees have reviewed their first 28 cases and plan to send at least 15 of the prisoners back to their native <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> `` in the near future,'' officials said Thursday. The announcement aroused the anger of many in the Cuban community in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, and attorneys representing the prisoners flew to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> seeking to halt the repatriation process. The 15 Cuban detainees are being held in a strict `` lockdown'' in a penitentiary in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. No detainee will be scheduled for return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> earlier than 72 hours after the government officially notifies each of the 15 detainees, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said The 15 the department said should be repatriated have convictions ranging from petty larceny to second-degree murder. Most of them have more than one conviction. The three-member panels will undertake further consideration of the remaining 13 detainees in the initial review group to determine whether they should also be returned to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> or be released. The panels were set up at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of last year's prison riots by Cuban detainees at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La </LOCATION>. The rioting occurred after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement with Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to resume sending many of the detainees back to the island. Deportations of Mariel detainees from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> were suspended by <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in May 1985. The detainees are among 125,000 people who came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1980 in a boatlift from <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, and the vast majority of them have become law-abiding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents. `` The reviews conducted by these panels go beyond anything that's required by law or by court order,'' <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON>, a deputy associate attorney general, told a news conference `` They're designed to give the detainee and his representative every opportunity to tell the panels anything they feel appropriate in reaching their decisions. Two attorneys went to <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, to challenge the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s action in federal court. One of the attorneys, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, said the expulsions violate the basic <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guarantee of due process under the law. In many cases, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said, the prisoners were not permitted to meet with their attorneys to submit documents for the administrative appeals the government agreed to after last November's riots. `` We're saying that many of these people are rehabilitated, many of these people are not dangerous,'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. `` But they're going to be deported nevertheless because they could n't ` meet their burden of proof.''' <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said `` right now, I think we've got about 500'' Mariel detainees who will undergo <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reviews to determine whether they would be repatriated to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said there are `` another several hundred'' serving sentences in state and local jails who eventually will receive repatriation reviews. According to information released by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, most of the 15 detainees have various relatives living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but only a few have wives. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official overseeing the Mariel Cuban review process, said the panels `` decided that on balance ... they could not subject the society to the greater harm'' of releasing the detainee. `` I think it is ironic that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government ... chooses to continue on the unfortunate path of deporting people to a country that our own <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador has characterized as ` one of the world's darkest dungeons,''' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leshaw </PERSON>, director of the non-profit <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> legal aid organization representing Mariel detainees. <ORGANIZATION> Separate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> parole review panels were also established in the wake of last year's riots and those panels have reviewed 11 cases to date, <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Copeland </PERSON> said. The panels determined that six detainees should remain in the custody of the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The other five will receive further review to determine if they are suitable for parole. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reviews are in addition to reviews conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Since June 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> has approved more than 2,400 Cuban detainees for parole. Another 400 detainees have been recommended for release.

<HEAD>Union of Concerned Scientists Criticize Stealth Bomber</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new Stealth bomber is unlikely to be able to carry out its wartime job of destroying mobile Soviet nuclear-tipped missiles, according to a report issued Thursday. The Soviets probably will be able to counter the bomber, meaning `` prospects for success in holding a significant fraction of Soviet mobile targets at risk are very poor,'' said the report by the Union of Concerned Scientists. The 19-year-old private organization has been critical of other <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration national security policies, particularly President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars anti-missile research program. The report was issued less than a week before the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> publicly unveils the bomber for the first time. The plane, known as the B-2, uses composite materials and an unusual `` flying wing'' shape to hide it from Soviet radars. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is planning to buy 132 B-2s at a cost of $ 68.8 billion, making it one of the most expensive weapons ever built. The Stealth would be one of the components _ along with the new B-1 and older B-52 _ of the bomber leg of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s three-pronged nuclear force. Other components of that deterrent are land-based and submarine-based nuclear missiles. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists' study, the main mission of the Stealth bomber would be to `` hunt down and destroy Soviet mobile nuclear targets during a protracted nuclear conflict.'' But that could cause arms control problems, the study noted. With both nations aiming to cut their arsenals of long-range atomic weapons by 50 percent through START negotiations under way in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, `` the survivability of their remaining forces will be critical to stability,'' it said. `` For the land-based forces of both superpowers, mobility will be a key means of satisfying this requirement,'' the report said. `` The B-2 bomber is thus out of phase with the trend of arms control.'' `` At a time when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should be tailoring its procurement of strategic forces to the post-START world _ and to the realities of a constant or declining defenses budget _ the B-2 is a step in the wrong direction,'' the report noted. But Capt. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFrank </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said, `` The B-2 may be at the heart of solving the mobile ICBM -LRB- intercontinental ballistic missile -RRB- problem, but the mobile missile issue is not the heart of the B-2 requirement.'' `` The B-2's primary mission is deterrence across the spectrum of conflict,'' <PERSON> DeFrank </PERSON> said. `` The B-2 will have the capability to penetrate the most sophisticated enemy defenses and threaten their most valued targets whatever they may be.'' But there are other problems, the study said. For example, the B-2 would be vulnerable to future Soviet defenses, such as space-based radar systems that could `` look down'' and spot the plane. In addition, the aerial refueling planes and necessary airfields needed to support B-2 flights would n't survive a prolonged nuclear war, the study contended.

<HEAD>Farmers Could Live With Budget Freeze, Farm Bureau Chief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farmers could live with a spending freeze designed to erase red budget ink without new taxes if they were not singled out for sacrifice, the leader of the nation's largest farm group said Thursday. `` I'm not talking about eliminating federal programs or cutting current outlays,'' <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. `` I'm only suggesting a moratorium on spending increases,'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said. `` Stop the increases, just the increases, and the budget would balance itself.'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> hog, corn and soybean producer, is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which is seeking ways to reduce the deficit. He has been mentioned as a possible <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selection for secretary of agriculture. <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said even a partial freeze with $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion in new spending could reduce the deficit quickly because of projected increases in revenue over the next five years of $ 80 billion to $ 90 billion annually. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has urged a `` flexible freeze'' to reduce the deficit while vowing not to attempt to balance the budget with a tax increase. It remains unclear how a flexible freeze might effect politically popular farm payments programs, which totaled $ 17.5 billion last year. Rebellion would not erupt in the Farm Belt over a freeze provided the agricultural sector did not come in for disproportionate cuts, <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said. `` I'm convinced that farmers wo n't object to a freeze ... as long as they understand that they are not alone,'' he said. But claimed that the idea behind the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was to recommend a politically unpalatable tax increase and in so doing allow politicians to shift the blame from their own shoulders. `` Let's be honest,'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said. `` The commission was created to provide cover for a tax increase.'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said there has been a campaign in the news media and elsewhere to convince voters that there is no alternative to a tax increase. `` The common conventional <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wisdom is that unless you people know that we need a tax increase to balance the budget you have your head in the sand and you're from <LOCATION> Sticksville </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> victory was evidence that the bulk of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters take exactly the opposite view of a tax hike. `` I will make the case that the election was a referendum on that issue because the other issues were n't that clear,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday authorized construction of 13 domestic communications satellites and the launch of nine. It also authorized construction and launch of 10 replacement satellites. The action brings to 42 the number of authorized domestic satellites providing a variety of telecommunications services, including video and data services. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the newly authorized satellites, set to be launched through 1994, will provide domestic satellite capacity through the end of the century. The last group of satellites was authorized in 1985. Of the 20 spacecraft in the group, only four are being constructed. The remaining 16 were casualties for various reasons, notably a slump in the satellite industry following the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1986, which grounded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program and severely limited commercial satellite launch options, said <PERSON> Fern </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarmulnek </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> satellite official. The commission said it granted all of the applications it received for the orbital slots 22,300 miles above the equator. The authorizations leave nine slots unassigned, <PERSON> Jarmulnek </PERSON> said. In making assignments, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also changed the position of certain slots in the orbit as required by a recent agreement with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> expanding the orbital space assigned to those two countries. In reassigning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites, however, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retains the same number of orbital slots for its satellites. As a result of the agreement, three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites that are in orbit will have to relocate. This will be accomplished by firing small thruster rockets on the satellites that are used to fine-tune the spacecraft's position in orbit.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation Thursday prohibiting the construction of hydroelectric dams on stretches of the Snake and <PERSON> Salmon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>. The measure also was designed to prohibit the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> from granting a license for a hydroelectric facility on <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tobesofkee </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> without approval of the governing body of <LOCATION> Bibb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The president said part of the bill was unconstitutional because it would have given local authorities power to perform `` significant authority'' pursuant to federal laws. As a result, he said, he was signing the bill with the understanding that it simply forbids the licensing of hydroelectric dams on the lake. Sponsors of the bill said it was designed to prevent interference with the use of the manmade lake, which has 345 private homes and a number of county beaches on its shores and to avoid interference with county revenues. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, the bill will affect 33 miles of the <LOCATION> Snake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Hells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> and 112 miles of the <LOCATION> Salmon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> upstream from its confluence with the Snake. Some stretches of the two rivers already are protected from dam-building because they are part of the Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and sponsors of the bill sought to extend this protection to the additional stretches even though they had not been designated part of the system.

 Israeli soldiers wounded at least 27 Palestinians during street battles in the occupied lands Thursday, including a 9-year-old boy and 14-year-old girl who were in critical condition, hospital officials reported. The army eased curfews and other restrictions imposed in an effort to curtail violence and celebration connected with Tuesday's proclamation by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of an independent Palestinian state More than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded since the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation began nearly a year ago in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in 1967. Eleven Israelis and at least 313 Palestinians have been killed. Hospital officials reported at least four people seriously wounded in confrontations in <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village, and several areas of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, including the Shati and <PERSON> Deir </PERSON> al-Balagh refugee camps. The wounded included the 9-year-old from the Shati camp, who was shot in the head, and a 14-year-old girl from <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION>, who was hit in the spinal cord by a bullet, the Palestinian doctors said. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a bomb exploded Thursday as a police vehicle passed nearby, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television said. No injuries were reported. The attack followed a day of scattered clashes in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers its capital. Three policemen were injured by rocks, and at least ten Palestinians were detained. Islamic extremists circulated a new leaflet Thursday urging residents of the territories to reject the declaration of an independent state by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which acts as the legislature of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. A fundamentalist group named <ORGANIZATION> Hamas </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Zeal -RRB- called for a three-day strike beginning Friday to protest the declaration, which includes acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions that implicitly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Palestine extends from the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> to the -LRB- <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> -RRB- sea,'' it said. `` This independence is imaginary and does not exist in the world of reality.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION>'s acceptance of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions -RRB- 242 and 338 means putting the armed struggle aside and giving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> the right to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>,'' it said. An army spokesman said troops raided <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, and soldiers opened fire on young Palestinians who hurled rocks. Officials at <LOCATION> Al </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said 13 Palestinians were wounded, three seriously. The army confirmed four wounded and said it was checking the other reports. Residents said health officials had announced they would give polio vaccinations Thursday and many of the 50 people wanted by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities returned to <LOCATION> Tamoun </LOCATION> from hideouts in the area. Soldiers arrived in nine vehicles and ordered the health officials to leave, the residents said. They reported three hours of street battles in the hilltop village, which was decorated with five outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and pictures of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. Windows in five houses were smashed. <PERSON> Izat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisharat </PERSON>, 38, showed a reporter his damaged car, which he said soldiers commandeered to chase stone-throwers. `` It was like a war,'' said <PERSON> Feisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaballah </PERSON>, 20. `` Every time somebody got wounded, people escalated their resistance.'' Slogans painted on the walls reflected the rift in <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> ranks. `` No to 181 partition plan. Do n't accept council that accepts compromises,'' said one signed by the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Another painted by the pro-Iraq <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said: `` <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has no right to interfere in our affairs.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> opposes <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the independence declaration, and supported <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in its war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The `` 181 partition plan'' refers to U.N. General Assembly Resolution 181 of 1947, which called for both Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states in what then was <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>.

 Stung by an earlier failure to cope with the threat of tiny parasitic honey bee mites, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it plans to hold a special buzz session to design a more effective plan. An advisory committee will try in two weeks to draft new federal regulations for preventing further spread of the destructive mites, which have been reported in 18 states. Beekeeping is credited by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> with the pollination of many agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around $ 20 billion. Those include many fruits, vegetables and hay crops. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the 15-member panel will include representatives of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> departments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, beekeeping organizations and related groups. The committee's first meeting will be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Nov. 30 through Dec. 2, he said. Although not known to be harmful to other creatures, the mites _ <LOCATION> Varroa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacobsoni </LOCATION> _ were first discovered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in September 1987 in a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> apiary. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agency imposed a federal quarantine last April to restrict movement of bees and bee equipment from infested states but canceled it a month later `` when the regulations proved too complex to administer successfully.'' <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the committee will employ `` negotiated rulemaking'' to form federal regulations acceptable to the various parts of the bee industry. The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their developing larvae, or brood. Department experts have described the female as about one-twentieth of an inch in diameter, with the male somewhat smaller. Infestations can cause decreased brood numbers, deformed bees and weakening of the colony's ability to pollinate plants and produce honey. The mites can infest a colony so gradually that it may be unnoticed until serious damage has occurred. Besides <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, state where the mites have been found are: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Glosser </PERSON> said the public can submit written statements at the meeting or send them in advance to: <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> APHIS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, Room 1143-S, P.O. Box 96464, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> 20090-6464.

 A 9-year-old girl who moved into an adults-only condominium complex after her mother died of cancer now lives under the threat of eviction. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> moved in with her father, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, and stepmother, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON>, last spring after her mother began chemotherapy treatment. Her mother died in September, and Friday <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> received a letter saying the Viewpoint Condominium association would seek a court order to remove <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> from the complex in this town north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` I felt like, ` My God, they really hate children, they really hate children,''' said <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, who added the turmoil could be tough on the youngster. `` With the trauma of having already lost her mother, she does n't need this.'' The association this week gave the family a one-month reprieve. <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> asked the condo board Wednesday to allow <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> to remain with the <ORGANIZATION> Swartzes </ORGANIZATION> until they sell the condominium, and association attorney <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Neway </PERSON> said the board would consider the request. `` No litigation is going to be instituted at this point,'' said <PERSON> Neway </PERSON>. `` I'm grateful. I regret that it took this for them to be considerate of our feelings and our circumstances,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON> said. The couple said they notified the association last spring that <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> would stay with them periodically while her mother, <PERSON> Maye </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>, was hospitalized. They also promised to find a new place to live if the problem became long-term. The board agreed to suspend its rule for three months, but last Friday threatened the family with the court order. <PERSON> Neway </PERSON> said board members were unaware of <PERSON> Maye </PERSON> <PERSON> Swartz </PERSON>'s death when they asked him to notify the family of the possibility of a court order.

 Tornadoes and waterspouts roared through three eastern counties Thursday, ripping roofs off houses, destroying some mobile homes and slightly injuring one person, authorities said. Twisters were spotted in <LOCATION> Currituck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tyrrell </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> counties. A tornado warning was issued for Dare County, although no damage was reported there. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spear </PERSON> of <PERSON> Creswell </PERSON> said he heard wind, then saw branches and small trees fly through the air just before he spotted the tornado. `` I grabbed my dog and ran toward the center bathroom in the house, and as I left the den, the back window just caved in,'' Spear said. He said he and his Labrador retriever, <PERSON> Fanci </PERSON>, were unhurt. <PERSON> Spear </PERSON> said the twister blew out the windows in the back of his home and tossed four trees onto his roof. The twister blew the roofs of two other houses, destroyed four mobile homes and damaged three others in the <LOCATION> Creswell </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Spruill </PERSON>, a sheriff's deputy. She said 75 to 80 trees were blown onto <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 64, and many of them knocked down power lines. More than 1,000 customers were without electricity, an official of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> power said. <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> hoped to restore power to the area by the end of the day, said C.B. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, operations supervisor.' A woman was treated at <LOCATION> Chowan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Edenton </LOCATION> for minor injuries after her mobile home was destroyed by a tornado, the hospital said. Some small tornadoes and waterspouts were reported over the northern beaches of the Outer Banks and the <LOCATION> Currituck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. A waterspout raged ashore at <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Currituck </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, throwing a construction trailer into a bulldozer and ripping the roof off a warehouse. A tornado blew over a mobile home and tore the roofs off some other buildings in <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, but no injuries were reported, the weather service said. In <LOCATION> Tyrrell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, three mobile homes and a house were destroyed by tornado-like wind, said <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swain </PERSON>, an emergency management coordinator in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. About 200 trees and a number of power lines were knocked down in the storm, but no injuries were reported.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> took a major step Thursday toward making advanced telephone services such as voice mail and computer gateways available on a wide scale to average consumers. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also, however, reopened a thorny issue that earlier met vigorous opposition from the providers of these electronic information services who resisted an agency proposal to add hefty charges to their bills. The commission's action moves toward opening the phone networks so that connections and circuits will be available on an equal basis to competing companies that want to provide advanced phone services. Competition, the commission says, will result in lower prices and more choices for consumers, as long as the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies are not allowed to use their control of the local phone networks to disadvantage competitors. Open Network Architecture, as the plan is called, `` will pass along to average residential consumers the ability to patronize the fruits of the information age,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>. The three sitting commissioners voted unanimously to approve the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> companies' plans in substantial part but to require revisions in specified areas, in part to ensure greater uniformity among their separate plans. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> also approved <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s plan in total. Many of the enhanced services dealt with in the plans are already available on a limited scale from the phone companies. Open Network Architecture is expected to result in more competition, which would bring the services to more consumers at lower prices, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> pointed to voice mail as an example of a service that it expects to become more widely available and attractive to average consumers. This service permits callers to send and receive recorded messages in a manner similar to that now available with telephone answering machines. However, instead of having to buy an answering machine, callers would need only a touch-tone phone. The messaging capabilities would be provided out of a centralized computer. Computer gateways allows easier access to electronic data bases. Computer users would have access to many different information services by dialing just one number. Most of the Bell companies applauded the action, but <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> should have allowed its plan to charge information service providers based on their usage of the network, instead of a flat rate as they are now. Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, who represents Tymnet and has been a leading spokesman for the information providers, said that while there was `` a lot of good news'' in the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s action, he was concerned about the issue of how these providers will be charged by phone companies. The commission specifically noted that an existing exemption from network access charges would continue for information service providers, although the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> agreed to begin proceedings that could consider removing the exemption under certain circumstances. `` This could have a dramatic and serious effect on the information services industry,'' <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> said, promising to fight vigorously against removal of the exemption. Earlier this year, after an outcry from the industry, the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> retreated from a proposal to lift the exemption. Without the exemption, costs could more than double, in some cases, for computer users dialing into information data bases.

 Political candidates who found themselves opposed by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> would often wind up wishing they could hire him _ or else blaming him for alleged dirty tricks that damaged their campaigns. Now President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has handpicked the 37-year-old <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to work on behalf of all Republicans who run for office. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selected his former campaign manager Thursday to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a choice sure to be ratified, probably unanimously, when the committee meets Jan. 18, two days before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration. `` He's a friend; I'm proud of his accomplishments,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the man who helped orchestrate his victory Nov. 8. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> will succeed <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a 48-year-old <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION> lawyer whose seven years in the post make him the longest-serving <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chief in this century. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s friends say that while he likes having a `` tough-guy'' image, his reputation for stepping beyond the bounds of political propriety is undeserved. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, who described himself as a `` nuts and bolts politician,'' will take control of a party that has been successful in electing five of the last six presidents but has not been able to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Politics has been his life; he's been active since his college days. `` I will be extremely campaign-oriented,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told reporters, adding that he hoped to help Republicans win elections from the courthouse to the state house to the White House. He said he would launch special efforts to lure black and Hispanic voters into Republican ranks. `` Every political reporter in the country worth his salt has scoured <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s background and have n't found one dirty trick,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, press secretary to Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atwater </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native, worked for <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> as an intern in 1978. `` I would say he's tough as nails,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` I think people probably do confuse tough with dirty.'' <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as a `` superb choice'' for the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> post. `` He's got a tough-guy image,'' said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> GOP Chairman <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hipp </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> enjoys it, to be honest with you.'' At times in the 1988 race for the White House, the image of Atwater pulling strings seemed to drive some of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Republican opponents to distraction. Early this year Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., accused <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> of being behind a series of disclosures about his wife's finances <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s answer was to call <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> `` a typical schoolyard bully _ he can dish it out but if someone hits him back, he starts whining.'' He also sent <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> a 10-page letter listing negative tactics that he said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> had used. Asked about that, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said, `` I do n't respond to <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>.'' But he already had. A day earlier, <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> confronted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and demanded an apology. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> used `` brilliant'' to describe <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s ability of drawing an opponent's fire to himself and away from the candidate he serves. That's what happened in the Dole-Bush confrontation when <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> complained, `` Here's the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign, maybe not the vice president himself, but <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and others out distributing things that they think might reflect on <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> for some reason.'' Television evangelist <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, at the time also a candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination, accused <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> of being personally responsible for setting the date of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> primary to give <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a boost just before the crucial one-day round of Southern primaries in March. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> could not bring himself to utter <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s name, but his meaning was unmistakable: `` I understand a campaign manager of an unnamed vice president is from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and he has determined he would like to have his man have a bit of an edge by a big win here ... that would propel him to a better showing throughout the South.'' <PERSON> Hipp </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> had anything to do with the timing of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> primary. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, another of this year's unsuccessful Republican presidential candidates, wanted to hire <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> to manage his campaign. `` I've always been a fan of <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s; I think he's a sharp guy,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I knew I could n't hire him.'' `` Is he going to have enemies? You bet,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I think people should let bygones be bygones. What good is it to hold grudges in politics?'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> signed on with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whom he had helped defeat for the presidential nomination in 1980. At the time <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was the manager of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s campaign in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and was credited with unleashing a series of radio commercials attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on gun control. In 1984 <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was the deputy manager of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s re-election campaign and later he became a partner in the lobbying firm of <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manafort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, whose $ 800,000 contract to represent the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> government briefly became a campaign issue this year. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> became politically active when he went to college and became national director of the College Republicans when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> chairman in 1973-74. Before that, he was a professional musician, playing the guitar for rock' n' roll singer <PERSON> Percy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledge </PERSON>.

 The judge in the Iran-Contra conspiracy case on Thursday rejected <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s charges of prosecutorial abuse by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, saying the defense had indulged `` misinformation and hyperbole'' in a motion to dismiss the case. `` North finds it appropriate to assert prosecutorial misdconduct in the harshest terms based solely on his self-serving suspicions,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said in turning back the motion. `` This is not the mark of responsible advocacy,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said, chastising the former presidential aide's defense lawyers. `` This is a motion which, by caption and text, appears significant, but which, in substance, is, to a considerable extent, based on misinformation and hyperbole,'' the judge wrote in a five-page opinion. The defense contended that prosecutors had given grand jurors `` patently erroneous'' legal instructions and `` systematically excluded'' evidence that would show the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel's innocence. But <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who has reviewed the grand jury transcript, said `` these exaggerated statements are made in total disregard of the careful instructions and monitoring of the grand jury throughout its proceedings by the chief judge of this court.'' `` Moreover, the statements concerning what occurred before the grand jury are largely based on inferences reached by counsel without any knowledge of what actually took place'' during the secret proceedings, the judge said <PERSON> North </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide, is charged with conspiring with former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, to illegally divert profits from U.S.-Iran arms-sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.

The judge dismissed <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s suggestion that prosecutors failed to tell the grand jury about whether the so-called Boland Amendments prohibiting direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to the Contras applied to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff. `` There is no requirement that the grand jury be instructed on every aspect of the law, as <PERSON> North </PERSON> appears to suggest,'' <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said. `` Never have prosecutors had to present all possible legal defenses to a grand jury, much less did the independent counsel have to introduce the ones suggested by North, many of which are based on the most speculative of legal theories, as this court has so ruled in dismissing several of his motions.''

<HEAD>EPA Proposes Rules Giving States, Polluters More Say Over Toxic
Waste Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday unveiled, 19 months late, a massive draft revision of regulations that could give states and polluters more say in whether toxic waste sites are put into the `` superfund'' cleanup program. The agency said it `` got what we wanted'' in a long battle with the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> over cleanup standards. Superfund provides money for cleanups only for sites that the program has placed on a `` national priority list,'' currently containing 1,175 sites out of 30,013 possible. Such a listing also qualifies communities for federal health studies and grants to community groups and local governments to pay for their participation in site discussions. States contribute 10 percent to cleanup costs, direct many cleanups under <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> oversight, and sometimes clean up sites that never make the federal program at all. Companies responsible for disposal of the waste in the first place also are handling many cleanups. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed regulations would permit the agency not to list sites if a state petitions to handle the cleanup on its own. `` EPA recognizes that many more sites need to be addressed than present -LRB- superfund -RRB- resources can accommodate; by deferring some problem sites to the states, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believes more overall response actions can be accomplished more quickly, and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> can direct its resources to sites that would otherwise not be addressed,'' the draft regulation said. Agreements with polluting companies to clean up sites and not put them on the priority list `` may facilitate <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> efforts to expeditiously obtain such enforcement agreements,'' it said. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> still would specify the details of the cleanup if the agency agreed with a polluter to keep the site off the list, it said. A state might want to keep a site off the Superfund priority list in the belief that it could get a cleanup finished much more quickly than <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s cumbersome procedures would allow. It would n't lose federal funds if the company responsible had agreed to pay for the cleanup. A company has an obvious incentive to keep sites off the list _ avoidance of publicity. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response, said he believed it would be difficult for a state to get full responsibility for a site if its cleanup standards were not as strict as <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strait </PERSON>, superfund specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said `` It's just outrageous'' for <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to propose ways to give polluters more control over cleanups and leave local communities without financial assistance by keeping sites off the priority list. The document also proposes extensive revisions to the numerical system by which <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> assesses the seriousness of toxic waste sites. The changes would permit threats to the environment, chronic health threats and potential threats such as accumulation of a contaminant in the food chain to be considered. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> was required by 1986 amendments to the superfund law to publish new final regulations by April 1988, which would have meant publishing a draft in April 1987, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. The statutory requirement for `` having -LRB- the draft -RRB- out in six months made interesting reading but it just could n't be done,'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. The 769-page, four-pound document will attract `` tons of comment,'' and will be adopted in about a year, <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said. The last revision took almost three years from publication to adoption, from 1982 to 1985. If there are no other applicable regulations on cancer-causing chemicals at the site, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> proposes to aim at cleanups that will leave nearby residents with no more than a one in 10 million to one in 10,000 chance of getting cancer. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> had sought to limit the lower end of this range to one in a million instead of one in 10 million. Some court decisions and other programs in EPA and other agencies have used one in a million as the cutoff below which risks may be ignored. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> had a `` legitimate question'' but <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> believed `` it would send a terrible message'' to adopt <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'s position because the agency already was using the standard. <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'s dispute with <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> lasted four months, and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could show his commitment to environmental protection by `` preventing <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> from interfering in the future. An aide in <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION>'s press office said she would ask if any officials wanted to reply to <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, but no one had responded by Thursday evening.

 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy judge on Thursday rejected two offers for the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry, ordered bidding to `` start from scratch'' and said he'd liquidate the evangelical empire if the sale is not completed by Dec. 13. `` It's either then or nothing,'' Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. The judge directed <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> to draft guidelines for prospective buyers that incorporate certain conditions he previously set forth. The auction Thursday between two Canadian businessmen was expected to close the books on the ministry that <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> built before a sex-and-money scandal forced it to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors. The judge, however, said he had decided to `` turn all of them down and to start from scratch.'' Bidding in the December auction will begin at $ 50 million to $ 60 million, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said, adding he expected one or two more bidders to appear. Reynolds scheduled another auction for Dec. 12 and said he would approve a buyer the next day, warning that if the case is not concluded by then, `` I will not put up with this case any longer under -LRB- Chapter -RRB- 11. I will move it to Chapter 7.'' Under Chapter 7, the doors would be closed and the court would proceed to a straight liquidation. In either case the sale proceeds would be applied to the ministry's debts, which could reach $ 130 million. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said he preferred Chapter 11 because Chapter 7 `` does n't bring the most money to the most people. Some creditors have pushed for immediate liquidation, citing the costs of keeping the facility running. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> is losing $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 a month. <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> real estate magnate <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 50, opened the bidding Thursday with a $ 70 million cash offer that allowed him to back out of the deal within a certain time after closing _ a provision <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> objected to. Canadian businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON>, a 34-year-old real estate developer who is an Orthodox Jew, then bid $ 115 million with a $ 50 million initial payment, but <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> objected that there were inadequate assurances that <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> would pay the remaining $ 65 million. Both <PERSON> Mernick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said they would consider their alternatives before deciding whether to continue bidding. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has been operating since last summer as a non-profit corporation known as <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The remaining for-profit organization, including the theme park, hotel and shopping mall at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> complex at Fort Mill and 1,700 undeveloped acres nearby, have been under the bankruptcy court's control pending its sale. With the proposed sale of assets, <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> as an entity would cease to exist, leaving behind only <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Australian businessman <PERSON> Gavin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morehu </PERSON>; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, businessman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinn </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> all have said they wanted to buy the site, then faded from view <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> fell from the bidding earlier this fall when he was unable to raise a $ 3 million down payment. The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> now are trying to raise money for a new TV ministry. The effort to sell <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> has dragged on since <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> withdrew an earlier deadline of Oct. 1 at <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s request for more time. <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection in 1987, three months after <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stepped aside over a sexual encounter with <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, a church secretary. Donations to the ministry dwindled amid ensuing revelations about the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> summoned Estonian leaders to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Thursday and expressed serious doubt about the constitutionality of the tiny <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> republic </LOCATION>'s unprecedented challenge to its authority. In <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> meanwhile residents gathered outside their parliament building with banners and flags, watching on live television as their legislators convened a session at which they will debate a similar challenge to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s authority. In <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> _ the third of the restive <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics _ residents prepared for demonstrations and rallies Friday on the 70th anniversary of the birth after World War I of their short-lived independent nation. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does not recognize the forcible incorporation of the Baltic states. ... The people of the Baltic states have been denied their basic human rights.'' The Estonian Supreme Soviet, or parliament, overwhelmingly passed a constitutional amendment Wednesday requiring Estonian approval of any new Soviet law. The parliament also approved a `` declaration of sovereignty'' asserting <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s independence in all areas except defense and foreign affairs. On their way to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, Estonian leaders expressed satisfaction with a constitutional amendment reserving the right to review all new Soviet laws, and said they were prepared to argue the issue with the Kremlin. `` Perestroika is a hope and democracy is a hope, and every hope has a moment of unease,'' the newly elected Estonian premier, <PERSON> Indrek </PERSON> <PERSON> Toome </PERSON>, said during a flight from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` The dialogue has begun,'' said <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Grazin </PERSON>, the Estonian lawyer who wrote the amendment and will defend it before the federal Supreme Soviet's Presidium, the highest executive body in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The Estonian parliament made its challenge under the banner of the reform effort President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> calls perestroika. The challenge illustrates <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s continuing serious problems with rising ethnic feelings that, if successful, could spread to other areas. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s first reaction Thursday was measured, but deeply skeptical. `` Taking into consideration that the amendment and a number of other documents adopted by the Estonian parliament are at variance with the provisions of the current Constitution of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, the Presidium of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> Soviet has decided to consider the above-mentioned issue at its next meeting, with representatives of the Estonian republic to be invited,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. The Presidium is the Soviet government's highest executive authority and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> serves as its chairman. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said committees of the national Supreme Soviet were ordered to prepare an analysis of the issue, which it said `` affects the initial principles of the building and unity of the Soviet socialist federation.'' It did not say when the meeting would take place, but presumably it would be before the national parliament goes into session again Nov. 29. Residents of the westward-looking Baltic republics have been pushing for greater economic and cultural freedom from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policy. Thousands of people in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> have joined the grassroots <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> organization. Some members say privately their ultimate goal is secession from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> have been angered by amendments to the national constitution proposed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, saying they would shift the little power they have to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and eliminate their constitutional right to secede. The three republics were independent countries between the world wars and were annexed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940 following a 1939 pact between the Soviets and the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>. There have been signs of <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> impatience with the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>. Politburo member <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, believed to be <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s closest adviser, said in an interview last month that they will not be allowed to take any major steps toward independence In another sign of the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s concern, three Politburo members were sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION> last week to urge them to tone down their nationalism. Former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chebrikov </PERSON> criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Estonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for encouraging nationalism. The Lithuanian parliament met Thursday in a session that will take up a declaration of Lithuanian as the republic's official language, and other legislation following <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s example. But <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelbaf </PERSON>, deputy editor of the official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litva </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview that the parliament took up only budgetary matters. He said the constitutional questions would be debated in a session beginning Friday. As in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, the session was televised from start to finish. Thousands of Lithuanians rallied Wednesday night outside the Supreme Soviet building in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, the capital, and hundreds more waited outside the parliament building throughout the day Thursday, said <PERSON> Veleya </PERSON> <PERSON> Terleckiene </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Terleckiene </PERSON>, daughter of <PERSON> Anastas </PERSON> <PERSON> Terleckas </PERSON> a leader of the separatist <ORGANIZATION> Lithuanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said they carried flags of formerly independent <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and banners supporting Lithuanian autonomy.

 Riot police fired tear gas Thursday to drive back thousands of angry farmers who were marching on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to protest imports of American farm products. Fighting began when police barred the path of about 7,000 farmers. Hundreds of protesters armed with rocks and clubs charged about 2,000 policemen, who formed a human barricade behind their shields a few hundred yards from the embassy. Scores of radical students joined the farmers and hurled firebombs. About a dozen protesters and police were seen bleeding or being carried away but police did not provide figures on injuries or arrests. <PERSON> Suh </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyong-won </PERSON>, an opposition legislator, was injured when he tried to stop police who charged protesters. Some citizens booed police when elderly farmers hurled their bodies against shields. Officers refrained from firing tear gas at that point and some moved away. The protesters dispersed after about 90 minutes, but thousands of police ringed the embassy and guarded adjacent streets and nearby residences of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats. Farmers had marched peacefully for about six miles after a rally near the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> building, shouting `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>!'' and `` Oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural imports!'' It was the most violent demonstration in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> by farmers, who have protested <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to open its markets to beef, wine and other agricultural products. Many wore headbands saying, `` No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine and beef'' and `` Down with <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. imperialists.'' South Korean farmers believe cheap agricultural imports threaten their livelihoods and have urged the government to resist <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure. Trade conflicts between the allies have fanned anti-American sentiment. Thursday's protesters chanted `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>, who force the market-opening pressure!''

<HEAD>Army Introduces `Manny' The Robot For Chemical Testing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUGWAY PROVING GROUND, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A robot named <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to test soldiers' clothing against agents used in chemical warfare. The $ 2.8 million man-sized mannequin, capable of walking, crouching, breathing and perspiring, is fitted with sensors to immediately detect penetration of up to one-billionth of an ounce of chemical agent through the clothing it wears. `` This is the kind of information it has been extremely difficult to obtain in the past,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lothar </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, scientific director at this sprawling <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> post in the western <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> desert. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>, who came up with the idea of using a robot in 1985, said such tests had been conducted primarily with simulants until now. `` The answers from these tests are not the same as the answers you get from real chemical agents,'' he said. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> -RRB- was definitely something we felt we had to have.'' The 5-foot-11 robot was developed by <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, which provided robotics for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> for handling of radioactive materials. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said the cost of the robot would likely ensure it will be one of a kind, at least for the testing of protective clothing worn by all branches of the military, which is performed at Dugway. The design is government-owned, but he said government approval of commercial sales would be `` a mere formality.'' Unable to balance itself, the robot hangs from a mechanical arm located in the small of its back. The robot's work is performed within a hermetically sealed environment and is controlled by computers. Reporters were given a demonstration in which <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> performed toe-touches, crouched, walked, duck-walked and kicked a ball dropped from his hand. `` I hope you enjoyed my demonstration,'' <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> said with a farewell wave. During tests, he would perform similar exercises while wearing protective gear in an environment contaminated with chemical agents. <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> can walk at 3 mph. Movement is provided by rotary and linear hydraulic actuators placed at each of his 38 joints. A clear plastic covers the skeleton, giving the robot a human shape. The plastic will be covered by a thick skin of butyl rubber, which will carry the chemical agent detectors. Perspiration is simulated by injecting water through capillary tubes to the surface of the rubber skin. Breathing is simulated by the expansion and contraction of the chest at variable rates. Moist air is injected at the nose and mouth to simulate exhalation. <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> can be decontaminated after a test without anyone entering the controlled environment. <PERSON> Battelle </PERSON> borrowed ideas for <PERSON> Manny </PERSON>'s arm from the robotic <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> performing at <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Battelle </LOCATION> technical group leader for mechanical systems and robotics. `` <PERSON> Manny </PERSON> is the result of a general realization that chemical warfare is a continuing concern,'' <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> said. `` What we issue to the troops we have to have a high degree of confidence is the best available.''

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday named <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> as White House chief of staff and tapped wily campaign strategist <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> as his top <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adviser prompted <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> to reveal that he would quit working for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after the transition ends in January. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said he informed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last month he would accept no post other than chief of staff. <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had let him know on Election Day that he was giving that job to <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would like <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, co-chairman of the transition team and his chief of staff since 1985, to consider a role in his administration but that he chose <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> because he was the `` right man for the job.'' `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> has the background and experience necessary to work not only with his former colleagues in the nation's statehouses but also to build a constructive relationship with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> outsider to be named by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, will bring `` a refreshing new perspective'' to the job, the president-elect said. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> will succeed <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who announced months ago that he would relinquish the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairmanship at the end of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s term and return to <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to practice law. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s function will be `` winning elections.'' While Republicans have won the presidency in five of the last six elections, they have been less successful at the congressional level, where Democrats hold comfortable majorities. `` I'm a nuts-and-bolts politician,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` I will be extremely campaign oriented.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will formally act on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice in January <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the announcements after meeting over breakfast with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and his customary weekly lunch with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Also on his schedule Thursday was an evening centennial banquet of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> share reputations as adept players of political hardball. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is considered a master of negative campaigning, and was an architect of the strategy that helped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wipe out a 17-point poll lead by Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and romp to a 40-state victory in the presidential race. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, 49, an engineer by training and a former <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, has no previous experience in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He has a reputation for being a quick study, highly intelligent and assertive. Some also regard him as arrogant and abrasive, traits that could hurt him in working with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> made light of that reputation Thursday. `` I'm a pussycat,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` Let me tell you about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Certainly I have a lot to learn in regard to the details. I think I'm a quick learner. I consider a great number of congressmen to be close friends, both Democratic and Republican.'' Jewish lobbyists have criticized the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor for being the only governor to refuse to endorse a proclamation attacking a 1975 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that equated zionism with racism. `` I'm very sensitive to that issue,'' said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, who is partly of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> descent. `` The problem I had as a governor is that I felt it was inappropriate. In terms of the issue, I have no problem saying it should be repudiated.'' He acknowledged that he was a considered a conservative Republican governor and had no intention of changing his political philosophy. But he promised to be a `` honest broker'' and consider both sides of an issue. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> had declined to run for a fourth term as governor, citing a need to return to `` the real world to get a real job.'' He and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, have eight children. He is credited with helping revive <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s candidacy with a victory in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> primary last February after the vice president finished a poor third in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s caucuses. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, 37, was a chief architect of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s winning campaign. A native of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> was a White House aide to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and also worked for Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. On other matters: _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about a report that he would meet with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s president-elect, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> `` If I were to have a meeting with the incoming president of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> ... it would be to symbolize the importance I place on the relationship with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' _ He said the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> would be an `` intelligence agency'' and would not be making policy After her meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> described him as a leader with a `` very, very wide knowledge'' who needs no introduction to foreign affairs. But she said she told him `` a fresh approach'' was needed in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was scheduled to make a quick trip Friday morning to <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for a private meeting with the executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, a past chairman of the association, also will attend. The president-elect was then flying back immediately to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, reportedly for a luncheon date with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already named two longtime friends, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as the cornerstone members of his Cabinet, as secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, respectively. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> after <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> quit in August to become <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chairman

<HEAD>Peres Spearheads Israeli Damage Control Over Palestinian Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, spearheading an Israeli damage control drive, accused the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday of deceiving the world by claiming it moderated its positions at the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` We feel very strongly that under the headline of moderation, what really happened is a more extreme position taken by the <ORGANIZATION> PNC </ORGANIZATION>,'' he told foreign reporters at a news conference. The council, which acts as the legislature of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, declared an independent Palestinian state Tuesday at the end of a four-day session in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> As of Thursday, 25 nations had recognized the Palestinian state. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> was considering recognition. Delegates at <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> also implictly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and said the council would limit guerrilla operations to military targets in Israeli-occupied territories. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the council's declaration of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state further sabotaged the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process `` I see an attempt to throw a stone into a structure of glass -LRB- the peace process -RRB-, so delicate, so breakable,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. He said the final status of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> must be negotiated in peace talks. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassadors sought meetings with foreign ministers in various host countries to explain <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position and prevent recognition of the new state. `` We are trying to have some damage control,'' he said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is also working out a joint strategy with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to keep the Palestinian state from being accredited as an observer nation in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. He said the outgoing Israeli government, deeply divided on peace issues, stood united in its rejection of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> positions. `` Is n't it your impression that we have the same position for a change? <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said when asked if he was stating government policy. He argued that the Palestinians at <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> rejected the three conditions posed by <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>: recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, renunciation of terror and acceptance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolutions 242 and 338. Resolution 338, in one major provision, calls for negotiations between the parties for `` a just and durable peace in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' Resolution 242, adopted earlier after the 1967 <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> war, asks <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw from captured territory and declares the right of all states in the region to exist within secure borders. In accepting 242, the <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> meeting coupled it with the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> argued that by adding phrases, the council perverted the meaning of the resolution. He also discounted interpretations that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by declaring a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state based on the 1947 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> partition plan which calls for a Jewish and an Arab state side by side in <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is not an implicit state. You either recognize it, or you do n't,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> had said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday that implicit recognition was insufficient. `` Recognition must be clear and unambiguous,'' he said. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also claimed the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had not renounced terrorism. In a statement in reply to written questions submitted by reporters, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> hailed a political declaration by the council on the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions as `` a positive development not only for the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> but for the whole world.'' The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> depends on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for most of its oil needs and sends thousands of workers to Arab countries each year. Nations which recognized the Palestinian state are: <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. The Egyptian daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Ahram </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> also recognized the Palestinian state, but cited no source.

<HEAD>Immigrations Board Says IRA Member Can Pursue Efforts to Avoid
Deportation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has ruled that <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, wanted for the killing of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> soldier, should be allowed to proceed with legal efforts to avoid deportation from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, received a copy of the opinion Thursday. The board had made its decision Monday. Under the 3-2 ruling, <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> is entitled to a hearing before an immigration judge where he could present claims for political asylum and withholding of deportation. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> would have to show a well-founded fear of persecution to substantiate an asylum claim. `` Federal courts which have considered asylum claims by the Dohertys of the world have consistently ruled in their favor,'' board member <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilman </PERSON> stated in an opinion concurring with the majority in the ruling. On June 14, then-Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> refused a request by <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> to be deported to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> instead of to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. That order was appealed. The government may appeal the latest ruling to Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> has been held in a federal jail _ the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> _ for five years while courts weighed whether the slaying was a political act, for which he could not be extradited to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> was convicted in 1981 of killing a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> captain in an ambush on a British convoy in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. In the closing days of his trial, Mr. <PERSON> Doherty </PERSON> escaped from a prison in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and fled to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he was arrested in 1983.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> passed its annual resolution Thursday urging <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> to open negotiations on the sovereignty of the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, over which they fought a 74-day war in 1982. The vote in the 159-member assembly was 109-5 with 37 abstentions. Last year it was 114-5 with 36 abstentions. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which won the war by driving an Argentine invasion force out of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> archipelago, cast its customary vote against the resolution but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> voted in favor. Sir <PERSON> Crispen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador, declared during debate: `` We are not ready to enter into negotiations on all aspects of the future of the <LOCATION> Falkland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. That would mean the beginning of negotiations which would represent the method by which <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> would recover sovereignty.'' `` The <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> government will continue to uphold the right of the <ORGANIZATION> Falkland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islanders </ORGANIZATION> to self determination,'' he said, but `` that does not mean there is nothing else to talk about.'' <PERSON> Tickell </PERSON> cited fishing as a possible area of agreement with <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, which calls the islands the <LOCATION> Malvinas </LOCATION> and claims to have inherited the archipelago from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1810. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has ruled the islands since 1833. About 1,000 men were lost on both sides in the war, most of them when the British sank the Argentine cruise General Belgrano. <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has not yet declared a formal end to hostilities and diplomatic relations have not been restored. About 2,000 people live on the islands. Most are fishermen or raise sheep.

 Lion tamer <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> said Thursday he plans to retire from the <LOCATION> Ringling </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bros. </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Barnum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Bailey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circus </LOCATION>, where he has been riding elephants and subduing <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION> for the past two decades. Dressed in blue sequined tights and jacket, the trim, blond <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON>, 54, said he wanted to retire `` while I'm still on top.'' He said he would tour with `` The Greatest Show on Earth'' for two more years before retiring at the end of the 1990 season. `` Tiger training is like race car driving, like boxing. You have to be really on top all the time. It's not possible to feel not so good one day. ... There has to be the time to say, that's it,'' <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> said in a thick, German accent flanked by a 40-year-old elephant, <PERSON> Nellie </PERSON>. Ringling Bros.. President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> said he plans to replace <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> with eight to 10 people doing various parts of the many animal acts <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> now performs alone `` It's the most difficult thing I've ever had to deal with,'' <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> said. `` Once in a lifetime there's a <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> was born in the German town of <LOCATION> Schweidnitz </LOCATION>, which is now a part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and was 12 years old when his widowed mother was hired by <PERSON> Circus </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> as a wardrobe seamstress. He soon began working with animals and became a master showman at age 16. He took over the business after owner <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> died and, in 1968, caught the eye of <PERSON> Feld </PERSON>'s father, circus producer <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feld </PERSON>. <PERSON> Irvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feld </PERSON> wanted to hire <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> to create a second touring unit of his circus. He bought the entire German troupe for $ 2 million when <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> refused to leave it. <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> has remained in the center ring since, becoming famous for his flashy showmanship, his flowing gold hair and his taming of tigers, elephants, horses, giraffes and other animals. His body is covered with scars _ bearing more than 500 stitches at last count. When asked about them at a news conference, <PERSON> Gebel-Williams </PERSON> quickly flung off his jacket, unbuttoned his shirt and rolled up his sleeves to show evidence of several near-fatal scrapes. True danger lurks with the elephants, not lions and tigers, because they are not housed in cages and they can easily snap most chains, he said. `` A tiger's in a cage, a horse is on a chain. It's much easier to deal with them. But elephants are loose all the time,'' he said. `` And they have strong personalities. They get jealous. My wife can never come close to one of them.''

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Chilean envoy on Thursday attacked a human rights report that accuses his country's military of burning two civilians with gasoline and questions <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s progress toward democracy The report by the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> focuses on human rights abuses in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and also singles out <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. Delegates of 31 nations in the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> received the report during their meeting Wednesday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The commission declared the Chilean government of Gen. <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> `` responsible for the death of <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> and grave injuries of <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> when they were burned by a military patrol in July 1986.'' According to the report, the soldiers doused the pair with gasoline, set them on fire, and left them at the roadside. The military said the two were throwing firebombs. But human rights groups and relatives of Ms. <PERSON> Quintana </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rojas </PERSON> said they were innocent bystanders. The case has attracted international attention. The report also said <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s defeat in a yes-or-no presidential referendum on Oct. 5 represented `` a positive fact.'' However, it said the loss `` does not imply the installment of an authentic democratic system.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, who came to power in a September 1973 coup, lost his bid to extend his presidency until 1997. The opposition is calling for early elections to end military rule. <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Ambassador, <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Illanes </PERSON>, said the commission had not given <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> credit for trying to end abuses. `` It seems to us the commission was only interested in negative aspects and did n't give importance to the progress of democracy,'' he said. The report also criticized communist-ruled <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where it said political prisoners received long sentences under harsh prison conditions. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> officials. In <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, the report found `` an increase in the activities of the so-called death squads'' that stalk victims for political ends. However, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cestoni </PERSON>, president of the Salvadoran government's human rights commission, said Thursday the report was unfair because it failed to reflect `` the damage from terrorist groups.'' <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> has been using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support to fight a nine-year civil war against leftist guerrillas. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, the commission reported `` advances, although precarious'' stemming from a March cease-fire pact between the leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed rebels who fought for seven years. But the commission criticized the Sandinistas for repression of an opposition demonstration in July and `` serious violations of the rights'' of several opposition activists. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tinoco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said his government was satisfied because the report reflected the difficulties imposed by the civil war. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will vote Saturday on whether to accept the report. <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sgambatti </PERSON>, president of the group's <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>, also told delegates to the conference Thursday that drugs are the biggest criminal problem in the history of the Western Hemisphere. She credited several nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, for their anti-drug efforts during the past year. <PERSON> Sgambatti </PERSON> also called for quicker extradition of drug suspects among member nations.

He tells crowds the choice is a simple one between `` John the Ripper'' _ <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> _ and `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> the Builder.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> strives to portray <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> as an anti-American who opposes progress, and points to the prosperity of his four years in office. `` The cause of my life is to build a nation,'' he says. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>, leader of the socialist <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks Thursday about the free trade agreement will hurt <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. `` It will remind every Canadian how close <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>, whose party is expected to finish third. `` It will remind every Canadian the Americans got virtually everything they wanted in this deal.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` As far as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is concerned, the Free Trade Agreement is an example of cooperation at its best. It is a testament to the commitment of our two governments to the principles of the open market and to economic cooperation.'' Opponents of the agreement had said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> speech could be interpreted as interference in Canadian affairs. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> must win 148 of the 295 seats to ensure the agreement takes effect Jan. 1, eliminating tariffs between the world's two largest trading partners over a 10-year period. It has been approved by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> but has yet to be considered by Parliament. Quebec has 75 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>, second only as a bloc to the 99 seats of <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, where opposition is stronger. The free trade debate has dominated the campaign since <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> dissolved <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 1. At the time, he appeared headed for an easy victory. The Liberals, long a dominant force in Canadian politics, had sagged to what seemed to be a battle with the New Democrats for runner-up status. But in a matter of weeks, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s persistent attacks on the free trade agreement as a threat to Canadian sovereignty and identity have revived his chances. Polls indicate that more Canadians oppose the agreement than support it. The polls also put the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives in a dead heat. Support for free trade has been strongest in French-speaking <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, secure in its cultural identity, but <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has by no means conceded the province. The opposition leader was in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> on Wednesday night and charged the prime minister is willing to sacrifice textile workers, garment workers, food workers and farmers `` on the altar of free trade.'' At <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s major campaign rally Wednesday night in a working class district of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, protesters' signs read: `` <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> for Governor of the 51st State'' and `` <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for the Canadians.'' The prime minister responded with the shout that the pact `` is good for <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, and it is good for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>!'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> is expected to do well throughout rural <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. Because of its strong cultural identity, there is little reason to fear the pact could bring in an overwhelming <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presence. The province also has a strong entrepreneurial bent that has helped fuel prosperity in the 1980s. Quebec's prime minister, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON>, is a leading supporter of the free trade agreement even though he is a Liberal. But polls indicate <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> will be more hotly contested that the rest of the province. During his campaign, <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has spoken of the 175,000 new jobs in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> since his landslide victory in 1984, 345,000 new jobs in the province, and 1.3 million new jobs across <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> comes from a working class background in <LOCATION> Baie-Comeau </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s north shore. He is the first French-speaking Quebecer to lead the <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and is greeted here with shouts of `` <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>!'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> scored points in the French-language debate with his unexpectedly strong attack on the free trade agreement, but <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> speaks French with a fluency his rivals ca n't match. He jokes with the crowds and moves about with ease, and he dismisses as `` scare mongering'' anti-free trade people who say the agreement will cost <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> too much. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> and other supporters maintain <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is mature enough to compete efficiently with its powerful southern neighbor. The prime minister will spend the weekend on a final campaign swing through <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, ending up in Baie-Comeaue for election day.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that two people have been indicted and 10 others accused of illegally importing and distributing unapproved drugs for animals. As part of the investigation, which began in 1984, the government also seized more than 30 tons of allegedly adulterated and misbranded animal drugs valued at more than $ 600,000. The seizures occurred in <LOCATION> Rushville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, Neb. The drugs were for distribution to veterinarians, farm supply outlets and farmers throughout the country. A 25-count indictment against <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ossining </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, accuses them of illegally importing and distributing animal drugs and drug products in violation of the animal drug provisions of the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. A federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, returned the indictment Wednesday. The indictment alleges that from May 1983 to October 1988, <PERSON> Dall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> and others conspired to illegally import drugs intended for animal use into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in violation of customs laws and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The indictment alleges that neither <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> nor <LOCATION> Dall </LOCATION> were authorized to receive or to distribute the drugs because neither they nor wholesalers who bought their drugs held government-approved new animal drug applications as required by federal law. The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that all drugs intended for use in animals have an approved new animal drug application prior to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marketing. On Thursday, the government filed a three-count felony information against <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, the former president and general manager of the now-defunct Custom Feed Blenders of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> is charged with conspiring to violate customs laws and the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, using false statements and practices to import merchandise and failing to register a drug manufacturing facility. The government this week also filed misdemeanor informations in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, against <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> and Sales, all of <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> ZetaPharm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Nissen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Blunk </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Wes </PERSON> <PERSON> Thoreson </PERSON> of Jewel, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. In Cedar Rapids, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the government filed charges against <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Tipton </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and against <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Langmo </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> Litchfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION>.

 Diabetics who are able to control their blood-sugar levels well are much more likely to keep their eyesight than those whose levels are poorly controlled, a study to be published Friday suggests. Thousands of people with diabetes go blind each year because of a condition linked to the disease called retinopathy, in which tiny blood vessels at the back of the eye break and bleed, usually painlessly and over a period of years. The condition afflicts both people who get diabetes as adults and those who get it at younger ages, say researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION>, who studied both groups over a four-year interval. More than 1,800 diabetics participated in the study. The researchers used blood sugar-levels to divide subjects into four categories and found that those in the highest-level category developed signs of retinopathy almost twice as often as subjects in the lowest category. This was true of all subjects taking insulin, whether they got the disease before or after age 30, the researchers reported in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Insulin, usually administered by injection, helps the body use sugar and other carbohydrates. Older-onset diabetics _ those developing the disease at or over age 30 _ who were not taking insulin showed an even greater disparity, with retinopathy appearing four times as often among the highest blood-sugar category compared with the lowest, the researchers found. Dr. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> E.K </PERSON>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, professor of ophthalmology and a co-author of the study, said Thursday, `` It suggests that ... -LRB- non-hospitalized -RRB- people with higher levels are at higher risk.'' But the study is too preliminary to use as a basis for changing the way people manage blood-sugar levels, because tighter controls can lead to serious medical complications, she said. Still, the findings suggest that even a modest improvement of blood sugar control `` may reduce the incidence of proliferative -LRB- advancing -RRB- retinopathy signficantly,'' they said. For example, the four-year risk of developing advancing retinopathy among people with an 11 percent reading for glycosylated hemoglobin, a blood-sugar test, was estimated to be roughly double that of people with a reading of 9 percent, they said. Regardless of blood-sugar levels, 59 percent of the younger-onset diabetics developed some signs of retinopathy over the four-year period, the researchers said. In the older-onset group taking insulin, the rate was 47.4 percent. In the older-onset group not taking insulin, the rate was 34.4 percent, the researchers said. In an editorial accompanying the study, Drs. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haffner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, said the new findings provide persuasive evidence that blood-sugar control is positively associated with the risk of developing initial or advancing retinopathy.

 A landlady suspected of killing seven elderly tenants at her boardinghouse to collect their Social Security money said Thursday she had cashed some checks but was no killer. <PERSON> Dorothea </PERSON> <PERSON> Montalvo </PERSON> <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, who vanished Saturday after police unearthed the first body buried in her yard, was arraigned Thursday but did not enter a plea. Clad in an orange jail jumpsuit, <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> listened quietly as the charge of one murder count was read and nodded her head to indicate she wanted a public defender to represent her. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinter </PERSON> said additional murder charges and special circumstances would be filed. Special circumstances mean the penalty upon conviction could be death or life in prison without possibility of parole. The case was continued until Dec. 15 and she was ordered held in jail without bail. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, 59, was arrested at a downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> motel late Wednesday after a pensioner she had approached in a bar became suspicious. Assistant public defenders <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Clymo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlautin </PERSON>, surrounded by dozens of reporters outside the courtroom, questioned the propriety of an interview <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> gave KCRA-TV while the jet leased by the station was taking her and police back to <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> early Thursday. `` I have not killed anyone. I told you that. I have not killed anyone. The checks I cashed, yes,'' <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KCRA-TV </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said he did n't ask specific questions about the murders, but only talked with <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> about general subjects. She also told <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON>, `` I used to be a very good person at one time.'' `` It's unheard of that a law enforcement agency would team up with a news organization to transport a person to jail,'' <PERSON> Vlautin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> was put on the jet with detectives and the television crew with `` no opportunity to talk to anybody who had her interests in mind,'' <PERSON> Clymo </PERSON> said. `` ... At this time, I do not believe she was given an opportunity to talk to a lawyer -LRB- before the flight -RRB-.'' `` Our client denies killing anybody. The true facts will come out in the courtroom,'' said <PERSON> Vlautin </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has enlisted the aid of the media to create a circus atmosphere.'' Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said he did not learn about the jet arrangements until Thursday morning. The matronly ex-convict walked away from her boarding house Saturday morning, after the first body was unearthed by officers. At that time, police said they did n't have enough evidence to detain her. But after the other bodies were discovered, a murder warrant was issued for <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> and a search launched in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said she apparently went to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> on Saturday, then took a cab to <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, where she boarded a bus for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> `` and has probably been there since that time.'' <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> was arrested after <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television told <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police that a viewer called to report meeting her in a downtown bar. She had given the man the name and room number of the motel where she was staying, and police arrested her there a few minutes later. `` The suspect had struck up a conversation with a male subject in a bar. They had been talking about Social Security,'' <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON> said. The two went to her nearby motel room and `` during the time he was talking to her, he realized it was the murder suspect he had seen on television.'' `` She was real cool, real calm. It looked like she almost expected it,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutzow </PERSON> said. The man, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON>, 67, said he became suspicious after <PERSON> Puente </PERSON>, who called herself <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanson </PERSON>, quizzed him about his Social Security benefits. `` She seemed so nice and sincere. She really was very believable,'' <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> said. `` She told me she needed her shoe fixed, and if I knew where I could get that done. That's how our conversation got started.'' <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON>, who receives Social Security and other disability benefits because of two strokes and other ailments, said <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> asked him where he got his money and then suggested that they share an apartment. `` She made a whole lot of talk about those checks,'' <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> said. `` I kept looking at the woman. Something just did n't seem right. I felt like I had seen her before,'' <PERSON> Willgues </PERSON> added, explaining why he called the television network. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police searched the motel room but found only three dresses, said Detective <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. The arrest warrant charges <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> only with the murder of <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, 52, a tenant missing from her boardinghouse, but police Sgt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> earlier called <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> a suspect in the killing of all seven people buried in her yard. None of the seven have been positively identified. The disappearance of <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON>, a mentally disabled transient, led a counselor with <ORGANIZATION> Volunteers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> to contact police, leading to the diggings. Police believe <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> killed tenants of her eight-bedroom boardinghouse for their Social Security benefits. They have a list of two dozen people who are missing and who might have lived there at one time or another. <PERSON> Puente </PERSON> has a criminal record dating to a 1948 conviction for forging checks. She served 2 -LCB- years in state prison in the 1980s for drugging and robbing three men she met in a <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> bar, and she is still on parole for a separate federal forgery conviction.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday he will hold a pre-inaugural visit with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s incoming president and promised not to take unilateral actions on issues affecting that country's well-being. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the pledge in a letter he sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Bilateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on the Future of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States-Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION>, which issued a report containing a series of recommendations on solving cross-border problems. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deputy national security adviser, Col. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, presented the letter to commission members on receiving a copy of the 238-page report. The commission, comprised of prominent Mexican and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, spent two years preparing the report. Among other recommendations, the report said unilateral measures must be avoided on issues affecting the two countries. `` I fully agree that two new administrations taking office at about the same time gives us tremendous opportunities to work together,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in the letter. `` One hallmark of my administration will be close consultations and a bilateral approach to problem-solving. Your report will be of great use in the future _ the effort was well worth it.'' At a news conference earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared taken aback when asked about reports he will hold a get-acquainted meeting Tuesday in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> with his Mexican counterpart, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who will take office Dec. 1. He stopped short of confirming the encounter would take place but said that any such meeting `` would symbolize the importance he places on relations with `` our front yard ... neighbors.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then quickly launched into an explanation of what he hopes to accomplish from such an early get-together. `` When and if such a meeting is announced, I will address myself to the question,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. `` But, if I were to have a meeting with the incoming president of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> before he is sworn in on Dec. 1 while I am still in transition, it would be to symbolize the importance I place on the relationship with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` I know something about that relationship and I have met with his two predecessors.'' `` If such a meeting takes place it will symbolize ... the importance of our front yard, our neighbors,'' he said. The vice president's office late Thursday night confirmed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> would meet and have lunch at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> next week. `` Their meeting symbolizes the close relationship of our two countries and the vice president's high respect for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It is intended to further develop a close consultative relationship and a bilateral approach to problem solving,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' victory in the July 6 election was clouded. Only on Wednesday did the main opposition party, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, end its fight to overturn the results. The opposition still maintained that <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' party, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, won as a result of fraud. The ruling party has not lost a presidential election since its founding in 1929. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the comment during a meeting with reporters to announce his selection of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> as chief of staff. He such a meeting with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> would not be official. `` I am not going to try to act like a president before Jan. 20th and take over the foreign affairs responsibilities from this president,'' he said. `` I do n't want to do that.'' But he added it would `` a simpler thing'' to work out such a meeting now `` before we are both sworn in.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> is to be begin his term Dec. 1. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will reportedly stop in Point Clear, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, to speak at a Republican governors' meeting Tuesday before heading to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He is planning to depart from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Wednesday for a Thanksgiving holiday stay at his oceanfront home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday night that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> expelled three members of the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for activities incompatible with their status, a diplomatic expression for spying. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> retaliated by expelling three member of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> and the three Britons have returned home, he said. The spokesman, who in accordance with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> practice refused to let his name be used, said the Iraqis were told on Oct. 18 they must leave and were given two weeks to do so. `` I believe they have left,'' he said. No immediate explanation was offered as to why the announcement of the expulsions was delayed until Thursday night, 16 days after the Nov. 1 expiration of the time limit set for the departure of the three Iraqis. The spokesman identified the three expelled Iraqis as <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassain </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jbara </PERSON>, an assistant press counselor; <PERSON> Ghassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shagir </PERSON>, a third secretary; and <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>, the chauffeur of Ambassador <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Mashat </PERSON>. He identified the three Britons expelled from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollis </PERSON>, a second secretary; <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Elvy </PERSON>, a visa officer; and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, a security officer. He said all three had been exactly what they purported to be, namely diplomats. There was no immediate reaction from <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> authorities to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> announcement. Relations between the two governments have been unmarked by any recent upsets. Earlier this year, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> thanked Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s support for a plan sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that resulted in the present cease-fire in the war between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged Thursday night that his new administration will seek to leave a planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> `` in better shape than we found it.'' The president-elect, in a toast at the centennial banquet of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The only path to a cleaner, safer planet is global cooperation on the environment.'' `` The plain fact is many of the problems we face in the environment _ global warming, ocean pollution, acid rain _ are international in nature,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told 1500 people at the black tie banquet. `` I plan to use <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leadership in the world as a force for leaving the planet in better shape than we found it.'' The society, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, producer of television specials and sponsor of far-flung explorations, presented centennial awards to 15 famous honorees, including astronaut and senator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, mountain climber Sir <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilliary </PERSON>, underwater explorer <PERSON> Jacques-Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Cousteau </PERSON> and anthropologists <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Leakey </PERSON>.

He said the society has brought `` to armchair explorers the wonders of distant discoveries, exotic customs, breathtaking natural sights.'' `` The Geographic's love of the planet <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> just leaps from every page.

 More than 10,000 people marched in sub-freezing weather to protest the resignations Thursday of the <ORGANIZATION> Kosovo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> president and another top official in this restive province. It was believed to be the biggest protest in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> since bloody riots in 1981. Some estimates put the crowd at 20,000. <PERSON> Kacusa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Kosovo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> party, and <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, her predecessor and a member of the powerful party presidium, announced their resignations at a meeting of the provincial <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership Thursday. The presidium approved both resignations, the state <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. It said <PERSON> Remzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koljgeci </PERSON>, also an ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON>, would act as president until the next session. No date was given. The two ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> leaders were the main target of resignation demands by <PERSON> Slobodan </PERSON> <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of the Serbian republic, in his drive to bring <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> under tighter Serbian control. Protesters marched through <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s capital, chanting support for <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> and bearing portraits of the late President <PERSON> Jozip </PERSON> <PERSON> Broz </PERSON> <PERSON> Tito </PERSON>. They chanted `` Unity! Fraternity!,'' `` Long live <PERSON> Kacusa </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON>!,'' `` We shall not yield <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>!'' and slogans against <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> addressed protesters packed into a sports hall, reassuring them the two would stay in the top leadership and appealing for peace. <PERSON> Jasari </PERSON> said she would step down as head of the 13-member <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> presidium, but would remain a member of the body, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> announced his resignation from the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> presidium in compliance with a recent decision of the federal party presidium prohibiting its <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members from simultaneously holding membership in local party bodies, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> is on the national party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The resignations brought to seven the number of top <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party leaders who said they were stepping down after Serbian and provincial <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders clashed at a meeting this month over Serbian demands for a purge of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s ruling elite. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON> has been backed by rallies attended by hundreds of thousands of Serbs in recent months. Slavs in <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> claim they are being harassed and forced to emigrate by the ethnic <PERSON> Albanian </PERSON> majority. Although administratively part of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> enjoys wide autonomy under <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s 1974 constitution, which was adopted under <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> and created a loose confederation of six republics and two provinces. The constitution is seen by many as a main cause of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s present ethnic and economic woes, since it leaves central power weak The march and a demonstration Thursday by about 4,000 miners indicated the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party leadership enjoys wide support among ethnic Albanians who make up about 90 percent of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>'s population The miners marched to <LOCATION> Pristina </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Titova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mitrovica </LOCATION> lead mines, 31 miles away, to protest the resignations. <PERSON> Milosevic </PERSON>'s supporters have repeatedly claimed the <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> party leadership lacks majority support. They said the provincial leadership could not cope with Albanian nationalism left simmering since 1981, when ethnic clashes left at least nine people dead. According to <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>, windows were shattered at the offices of the Belgrade-based daily <ORGANIZATION> Vecernje </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, but no other incidents were reported. By about 10 p.m., most of the crowd had dispersed. In another development Thursday, workers of the country's major cotton yarn manufacturer <PERSON> Djuro </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaj </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mostar </LOCATION>, in western <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, walked out demanding a 60 percent pay increase, <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> reported. The plant employs about 6,000 workers. Average monthly salary for a worker is about $ 61.

 Students at <ORGANIZATION> Meadowdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> thought a classmate was the Crown Prince of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> until police learned that the sporty red car he drove was stolen and he did n't have his royal father's telephone number to call for help. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, was in <LOCATION> Dayton-Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail after being charged Wednesday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> with receiving stolen property. A <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> grand jury on Thursday indicted him on two counts of theft by deception. Students say the flashy foreign-exchange student they knew as 17-year-old Prince <PERSON> Sparkle </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> dressed in the latest fashions and wore gold jewelry around his neck and a diamond ring. He spurned school buses in favor of a red 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION> car and reportedly once rented a chauffeured limousine to take him to a <ORGANIZATION> Meadowdale </ORGANIZATION> football game. `` I ca n't believe it,'' said freshman <PERSON> Shamika </PERSON> <PERSON> Bohanon </PERSON>. `` He could dress. It seemed like he had on a different pair of shoes every day.'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> was the subject of an article in the school newspaper, and during a recent lecture for the student leadership club told students he would inherit the Moroccan throne when <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> died. He also told students he had studied with the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> last year, school officials said. But the royal act began to unravel Monday when <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION> police detective <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spotted <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s car, which was bearing <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> license plates, in the school parking lot. He ran a check and learned it had been stolen. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he and other police officers waited until <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> got into the car with a female companion and then stopped the vehicle. `` Do you know who that is?'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the girl told the officers. `` That's the prince of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said at that point school officials and security guards confronted them. `` That kid is the prince of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> quoted one school official as saying. `` What are you going to do to him? You're going to start an international incident right here in our parking lot.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he took <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> into the school and found that he knew the capital of <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, the name of the prime minister and even the date of the country's independence day. But the officer said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had no passport or immigration card. `` He was talking in a very Middle Eastern accent,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> recalled. He quoted <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> as telling school officials: `` You mean to tell me you let murderers go free in this country, and you're going to let them lock me up for this? <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he then asked <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> to call his father on the telephone. `` The king?'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he took <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> into custody after he said he left his father's phone number at home. <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's detective <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who stands about 5 feet, 6 inches and weighs about 110 pounds, told police his name was <PERSON> Monlay </PERSON> <PERSON> Rashid </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said everything changed when <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> discovered police knew his real identity. `` He was confronted with that, and basically he finally admitted to being <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. `` When we said, more or less, ` the game's over,' that's when he finally lost his Moroccan accent.'' <ORGANIZATION> Meadowdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> asked to enroll at the high school in September, just days after classes had started. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> told school officials his father wanted him to go to school in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and that he liked <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. He was enrolled as a senior. <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said he became suspicious when the student's high school transcripts never arrived. The principal said <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had said he had been staying with a host family by the name of <PERSON> Flagg </PERSON>, but he had no additional information. <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> police detective <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said he arrested <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> last May on charges of obtaining a car under false pretenses. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said at that time <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> gave his name as <PERSON> Nakita </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandiest </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>. `` He's nothing but a con artist; all indication is that he is,'' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> said. He expects <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> to face numerous additional charges in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. The charges <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> faces in <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> stem from the theft of a <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daytona </ORGANIZATION> from a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> car dealership last spring. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> could be sentenced to one to two years in prison and fined up to $ 5,000 if convicted in <ORGANIZATION> Vandalia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on the charge of receiving stolen property. He was being held in the <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> jail in lieu of $ 7,500 cash bond. He also could be sentenced to one to five years on each count of theft by deception.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday overwhelmingly demanded that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> grant independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> regardless of the presence of 50,000 Cuban troops in neighboring <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The demand was part of a package of five resolutions that ask for sanctions to punish <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for ruling <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, and a program to implement the sanctions and press for independence. A procession of 71 speakers came to the podium in debate that ran from Monday through Thursday to castigate <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for occupying <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in defiance of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. Not one nation voted against any of the proposals, although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> abstained on some. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> was stripped of its voting rights in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abstained to maintain its neutrality while mediating peace talks among <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. South African, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and Angolan negotiators tentatively agreed this week during talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> that the Cubans will leave <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> will allow the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to begin a one-year independence plan for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. If their governments ratify the accord, the Namibian idependence process could begin early in 1989. Cuban troops have been in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since 1975 to defend that country's Marxist government from raids by the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement _ the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Total </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angola </ORGANIZATION> _ and its ally, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has ruled <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> for 73 years since <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> lost the former colony during World War I. The League of Nations, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' predecessor, subsequently granted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a mandate to administer <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. In 1966, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> revoked the mandate. In 1978, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed Resolution 435, a one-year plan to set up a constituent assembly to adopt a constitution and organize an independent goverment. The resolutions passed Thursday call <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s occupation an `` act of aggression'' and demand prisoner-of-war treatment for captured members of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the guerrilla group fighting for independence. <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is designated in the resolutions as the `` sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.'' For years <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> has held non-voting observer status in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> told the assembly that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> objects to that characterization, and said `` only free and democratic elections.. will provide the <LOCATION> Namibian </LOCATION> people themselves the opportunity to choose whom they want as their representative.'' The resolutions also call for mandantory economic sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a step that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have blocked before in the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> by using their veto power.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Thursday that opposition to the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> could grow in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> unless <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rethinks its plans for cost-sharing among members. Hours after he spoke at <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>'s City Hall, about 8,000 opponents of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> marched, fired flares and battled riot police to bolster their demand that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> pull out of the military alliance. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> made his comments before an independent 16-nation body of lawmakers called the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, which has been holding its annual congress since Sunday. Protesters later fired flares at the building and clashed with riot police nearby, but the delegates had already ended the day's session. Several people were injured, and at least two demonstrators were arrested, police said. No reports emerged of fire or damage. The marchers, mostly young, carried banners reading `` <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terror </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` Get Out of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' and other slogans. Some demonstrators threw stones at police as they moved in to make arrests, said a police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. Most demonstrators dispersed, but some remained and clashed with riot police who were carrying shields and truncheons, witnesses said. The remaining protesters later fled. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> acts as host to more than 400,000 allied soldiers on its soil and will continue to fulfill its <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> obligations. But he added, `` We should also not overtax one another and thereby conjure up the danger that acceptance of the alliance could be damaged.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a staunch supporter of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has recently been emphasizing that West Germans hesitate to accept greater financial burdens within <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. On Thursday, he broadened that message to include other nations in the Western European alliance. His speech came amid growing sentiment in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should shoulder a greater defense burden. West Germans, however, argue that other kinds of national contributions to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> should be taken into account. They say they should get credit for putting up with military hardware and soldiers on their territory. The chancellor ruled out removing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> short-range nuclear weapons deployed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials worry pressure to scrap the weapons could mount among West Germans who view the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a decreasing military threat.

 Riot police swung clubs and fired tear gas Thursday at hundreds of anarchists who hurled sticks and stones at them outside the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, witnesses said. Police said they made at least 10 arrests. No injuries were reported. The anarchists arrived at the embassy at the conclusion of a march by 20,000 demonstrators who were marking the 15th anniversary of a student uprising against the 1967-74 military dictatorship in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The peaceful march started at <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, site of the Nov. 17, 1973 rebellion which was crushed by troops and tanks. It ended at the fenced embassy compound on <LOCATION> Vasillis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sophias </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, a main boulevard, where protesters shouted, `` Americans, murderers of the people, get out now!'' After march participants left the embassy area, the anarchists began to battle police. More than 20 young people were killed in the 1973 student uprising, which is credited with triggering the military regime's collapse The annual march to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> reflects a widely held belief that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support enabled the colonels to remain in power. The demonstrators chanted slogans urging Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s socialist government to remove four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases that have operated in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> since the early 1950s.

 A car containing what authorities believed were the bodies of four young people missing since last weekend was found Thursday on the bottom of a murky river, police said. A detour sign on the road incorrectly directs traffic to the dead end where the accident occurred. A second sign warns of danger ahead. The three women and one man, ages 19 and 20, were last seen by their parents about 7 p.m. Saturday, when they left their hometown of East Lyme for an evening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>. Autopsy reports were pending, but police Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> said it was likely the four victims were the missing young people. The car approached an open swing bridge and went into the water over a barrier blocking the roadway, <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> said. Others said the bridge, which swings from side to side, had been in an open position for several years. Several news reports, quoting unnamed sources, said no barriers were in place blocking the road on the night of the accident. A service station owner said that a wooden barrier normally blocks the roadway, which was cordoned off by police Thursday. `` I have no information either way,'' <PERSON> Sorrentino </PERSON> said. `` I've been led to believe the barriers were always there. A crane was used to pull the car from the water, while some family members waited in a police van. Police have determined the four spent at least part of Saturday night drinking illegally at a bar near <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said state police Detective <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Trudelle </PERSON>. An employee of the bar told authorities they left together about 3 a.m. Sunday, <PERSON> Trudelle </PERSON> said. The legal drinking age in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> is 21. `` They were good kids. I ca n't picture them being drunk and driving,'' said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Funaioli </PERSON>, who said she was at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> bar last Thursday with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, one of the missing. The missing women were identified as <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON>, 19, a student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Christy </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 19, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Mohegan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagrotteria </PERSON>, 19. `` It's horrible. It's the most horrible thing I've ever seen happen,'' Ms. <PERSON> Funaioli </PERSON> said. Police divers found the car submerged in about 15 feet of water in the <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, in a little-traveled, old and industrial part of the city, just north of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> harbor, police said. The bridge has been closed for several years because of roadwork in the area, business owners said. There were no skid marks at the scene, and police said an investigation would determine if the car was speeding. Family and friends described the four former high school buddies as responsible adults unlikely to take off without telling anyone. They were last seen by their parents Saturday evening, when they left for an evening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>. The parents had distributed pictures of the missing and offered a $ 25,000 reward. Thursday night, about 200 friends and relatives of the victims packed a <LOCATION> Niantic </LOCATION> church for a prayer service. `` There are no words to take away your pain,'' said Assistant Pastor <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Whinnem </PERSON> <PERSON> Etter </PERSON>. `` The only way to respond is to celebrate the love and the joy that these friends shared.''

<HEAD>Pinochet Rejects Changes Urged For Transition To Democracy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Military President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> firmly rejected on Thursday opposition calls for constitutional changes before <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s return to elected civilian rule in 1990. He said the reforms urged by dissidents would `` undermine the basic structure'' of the constitution. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s lame-duck government had hinted this week at talks with the opposition that beat him in an Oct. 5 referendum on extending his rule until 1997. In a speech at a luncheon with supporters in <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arenas </LOCATION>, 1,550 miles south of <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said his right-wing government is prepared for a `` constructive exchange of ideas'' with the opposition, `` but within the present legislation.'' `` The opposition, under the pretext of improving the constitution, aims at the destruction of the new institutionality,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said, referring to the 1980 military-written constitution. The text of the speech was carried by the state-run news agency <PERSON> Orbe </PERSON>. Under the constitution, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>'s referendum defeat makes an open presidential election mandatory in December 1989, with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> handing power over to the winner in March 1990. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has rejected demands for his earlier departure from power. He has ruled since leading a 1973 military coup toppled the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, who died during the overthrow. After their referendum victory, opposition parties listed constitutional changes they said were needed for a fast, smooth transitition to democracy. The list included eliminating one article that bans Marxist parties; changing another that makes one third of the future 36-member senate appointed instead of elected, and reforming the composition of a military-dominated <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition sees this council as a permanent threat to future civilian government. The opposition also wants easier rules and lower quorums for changing the constitution in the future. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> rejected all the demands, one by one. `` Opening a space to Communists in the political system means giving them the faculty to use democracy to destroy democracy,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said. He warned he will be `` adamant'' in rejecting that, `` because the freedom of Chileans can not be the subject of negotiations or compromise.'' He said he can not accept easing the procedures for future constitutional amendments, because `` the fundamental charter, which is the basis of democracy, can not be left exposed to occasional political majorities or temporary electoral pacts.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said that reducing the military presence in the security council would mean `` again isolating the armed forces'' from the rest of society. `` The armed forces have a professional role, but within the national reality, not outside it,'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> said.

 Some 2,000 gallons of radioactive water spilled at the <LOCATION> Pilgrim </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, slightly contaminating one worker, officials said. The water overflowed a collection area during a cleanup at the plant on Wednesday, said plant owner <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The spill occurred at a low-level nuclear waste processing area at the plant, which is awaiting word from the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on whether it can begin low-level power testing after a two-and-a-half-year shutdown. `` The Department -LRB- of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- found no evidence that any radioactivity was released beyond the plant fence,'' said a statement issued Thursday by Dr. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, deputy public health commissioner. `` The level of radioactivity spilled was below the levels that would require notification of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' the statement said. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> said some of the water seeped from the processing facility and onto an asphalt lot in the open air. <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> said it notified the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> about the spill. <PERSON> Pilgram </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fidler </PERSON> said the worker's knee touched some water during the spill cleanup and was washed with soap and water.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge who heard almost as many versions of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> origins of chop suey as there are characters in the Chinese alphabet, sampled a a plate piled high with the stuff and on Thursday issued his ruling. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, of course. Municipal Court Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Choppelas </PERSON>, presiding over a mock <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, ruled the vegetable, meat and noodle dish described as `` Chinese soul food'' and first made with `` anything that crawled or moved'' appeared on a Gold Rush-era <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> table about 1850. That was 30 years before it found its way to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chinatown </LOCATION> menus. The tongue-in-cheek court has decided other questions such as who invented spaghetti, where the first martini was mixed and whether the panic instilled by <PERSON> Orson </PERSON> <PERSON> Welles </PERSON>' 1938 broadcast about a Martian invasion could happen today. <PERSON> Choppelas </PERSON> said his finding was supported by both oral history handed down through generations of Chinese-American families in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a story of its origins with elements of life-or-death necessity and cunning business wiles. The story came from witness <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Soo </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. She testified that according to family legend, her husband's grandfather was working at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> boardinghouse around 1848 when a band of drunken, hungry miners unable to find any restaurants open stormed the rooming house. When the house owner said he did n't have any food left, <PERSON> Soo </PERSON> said one of the miners aimed a gun at his head and threatened him. His imagination ignited, the owner returned to the kitchen and hastily assembled a dish of vegetables and discarded meat entrails. Heaped on a bed of steaming rice, the slap-dash dish was served to an appreciative group. `` That whole group enjoyed it very much,'' <PERSON> Soo </PERSON> said. One of the miners asked what the dish was called, `` The boardinghouse owner said, ` Oh, chop suey.''' <PERSON> Choppelas </PERSON> said the quick-thinking owner not only saved his own life, but gained some loyal customers. <PERSON> Soo </PERSON>'s story was supported by <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, owner and partner in the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> restaurant and <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Toy </PERSON>'s in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. A fourth-generation Californian, <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> said his family came to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the Gold Rush. <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> said many frugal Chinese people working in mining towns survived on leftovers from mine owners and were forced to eat `` whatever crawled or moved.'' Chop suey, what <PERSON> Yu </PERSON> called `` Chinese soul food,'' is likely to have originated from these humble beginnings in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and not in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where large numbers of Chinese later immigrated, he said. Disputing that theory was former New Yorker and publicist <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON>, who admitted that he and lawyer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> had difficulty deciding if <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> was the `` su-or or the suey'' in this culinary case. Chop suey came to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the 1850s, <PERSON> Cutler </PERSON> said, when a visiting Chinese dignitary dined with President <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleveland </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>. Because of a sensitive stomach, the dignitary declined the American-style feast and instead had his own chefs whip something up for him _ chop suey. <PERSON> Choppelas </PERSON> quipped that New Yorkers like to claim everything good, but noted, `` They do n't call it <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION> suey.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says Afghan Human Rights Situation Improves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATIONS </ORGANIZATION> _ A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said Thursday that the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Afghanstan </LOCATION> improved somewhat in government-controlled areas, but it said acts of terrorism by rebels increased in the past year. The 37-page annual human rights report on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said that while the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Agreements, signed April 14, `` give grounds for hope, the special rapporteur -LRB- the person assigned to prepare the report -RRB- has still not been able to report any improvement in the human rights situation within the country. `` Acts of war are continuing, violations of human rights are at least as frequent as in the past, affecting particularly the civilian population and endangering the lives and security of innocent men, women and children.'' The rapporteur, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Ermacora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, is the special investigator of the Afghan human rights situation for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A similar report last year said the main problem in realizating human rights there was the presence of more than 100,000 Soviet troops. Half of them have been withdrawn under U.N.-mediated agreements signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The rest are to be pulled out by Feb. 15, although <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has suspended its withdrawal because of increasing attacks by U.S.-backed and Pakistan-based rebels. The report said, `` In general, there is greater improvement in the human rights situation in government-controlled areas. However, allegations of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners on remand -LRB- awaiting trial -RRB- and political prisoners are still being received,'' he said. Afghan authorities reject the allegations. <PERSON> Ermacora </PERSON> said the number of political prisoners has fallen sharply as a result of anmnesty decress and other measures under the Afghan government policy of national reconciliation. Conditions of detention in <LOCATION> Pol-i-Charkhi </LOCATION> prison, a major center, have improved, it said. But the investigator also said that after the signing of the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agreements </ORGANIZATION>, which Afghan rebels rejected, `` acts of terrorism ... have caused many deaths among innocent civilians.'' `` Terrorism in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has multipled,'' since his report last year, he said. The report cited government reports of rebel violence from April to last August. It said heavy artillery and ground-to-ground missiles were used against towns and villages, charitable institutions and mosques. The report cited 4,154 cases of missile firings and 24 explosions, killing 945 civilians and wounding 1,895, including 187 children and 98 women. It said a rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> killed nine civilians on Sept. 1 and wounded 20. On Sept. 27, a rocket attack on a <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> neighborhood reportedly killed 35 civilians Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, it said, still are afraid to return home, largely because of rebel-planted mines. The report said withdrawing Soviet troops had committed human rights violations and it cited reports of Soviet bombing and bombardment of civilian areas. On March 7, it said, Soviet artillery bombarded residential areas in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, at the end of April migrating nomads were attacked by Soviet and Afghan troops and houses, schools and mosques were damaged and destroyed in other Soviet attacks. `` Many Afghan villages and houses have been destroyed in the course of the Soviet troop withdrawal and many civilians have been killed due to the fighting tactics of the oppostion movements and acts of retaliation,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said treatment of prisoners of war violates the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Prisoners are used as a means of barganing and exchange, it said. The whereabouts of at least 313 Soviet soldiers missing in action is still unknown, it said. The Afghan government considers rebels to be terrorists and not combatants to be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law, it said. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> should be given full access to all prisons and detention centers.

 Millions of smokers on Thursday swapped their cigarettes for apples and gum, went cold turkey for free turkey sandwiches and tossed their tobacco into bonfires as part of the 12th annual Great American Smokeout. Newborns in several hospitals wore `` I'm a Born Non-Smoker'' city workers in <LOCATION> Cedar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, sported pins and stickers that said, `` Kiss Me, I Do n't Smoke; and non-smokers joined `` adopt-a-smoker'' programs to help smokers through a smokeless day. The American Cancer Society estimates nearly 40 percent of the nation's 50 million smokers tried to quit for the day. About one-tenth, or 2 million people, will kick the habit permanently, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, a cancer society spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` My grandkids keep telling me it's time to quit smoking,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Zielke </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crosse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and a pack-a-day smoker for 40 years. He quit smoking for the day and was `` adopted'' by a cancer society volunteer. Actor and former smoker <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, star of the television show `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' said the smokeout was the day to just quit lighting up. `` The key to quitting for good is just quitting. There's no tapering off, you just have to go cold-turkey,'' said <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>, who is honorary chairman of the observance. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the cast and crew of Off-Broadway's `` Steel Magnolias'' went cold turkey. `` It's going to curl some of their hair,'' teased non-smoker <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, hair designer for the play, which is set in a beauty parlor. Smokers traded their cigarettes for apples in several cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Non-smokers got apples, too, along with a `` good for you.'' Some hard-core New Yorkers eyed the apples suspiciously. Others took them to wives, boyfriend or co-workers who smoke. Some, like <PERSON> Sino </PERSON> <PERSON> Perratore </PERSON>, threw their cigarettes into a waste basket at Rockefeller Plaza. In <LOCATION> Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, pharmacist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Fellows </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> burned four cartons of cigarettes, four boxes of cigars and several boxes of chewing tobacco in a hibachi outside his store. The burning tobacco was all he had left after deciding several months ago to stop ordering the products and to burn what was left. `` I thought I would make a statement; maybe someone would stop and think and stop smoking cigarettes before it was too late,'' Fellows said. A chain of three pharmacies planned a similar tobacco bonfire in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, 10-feet-tall cigarettes were erected downtown, complete with smoke-generating machines. Fire crews doused the smoldering cigarettes and chopped them into small pieces. In <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, a 5-foot-tall smoking cigarette was put out with fire extinguishers by workers at the Baptist Medical System building. One employee, <PERSON> Lana </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, said this is about the third time she's used the smokeout to try to quit. `` You know what they say, if at first you do n't succeed,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. The grandson of tobacco magnate <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> joined with <LOCATION> Pleasanton </LOCATION>, Calif.-based publisher <ORGANIZATION> SyberVision </ORGANIZATION> to launch a $ 20 million television advertising campaign accusing the tobacco industry of addicting millions of Americans. `` My grandfather, <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, helped get <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> hooked on cigarettes through clever advertising. Now, I'm going to use the power of advertising to get <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unhooked,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. Thousands of Californians rode aboard the `` Smokeout Express,'' a train coach on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diegan </LOCATION>, which took a whistlestop no-smoking journey through <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. A pipeless Mr. Potato Head, the popular toy spud, joined them. One <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> crusader against smoking tried to stuff 143 cigarettes in his mouth at one time to show that smoking is ugly and hazardous to your health. `` I'm showing how ridiculous it looks. Some people smoke this much in a day or week,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouth </PERSON> as he prepared to shove the more than seven packs in his mouth at <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s Pipe Shop in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Businesses and schools in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, received visits from a 6-foot-tall turkey clad in winter garb. `` Our turkey is wearing a scarf and a vest and encouraging people to quit cold turkey,'' said <PERSON> Deb </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>, a cancer society spokeswoman. They were also talking turkey near the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, where a sandwich shop gave free 6-inch turkey sandwiches to people who turned in a half-pack of cigarettes. The anti-smoking demonstrations persauded many to try to kick the habit. Others finally heeded the warnings that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory disease. The surgeon general has warned of the potentially fatal risks of smoking and the addictive properties of nicotine, the drug in cigarettes. <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ham </PERSON>, a smoker for 35 years, got the message. `` I've been cutting down slowly. I've gone a whole day without smoking in the last two weeks, and I've cut down to five or six cigarettes a night,'' she said in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. `` I want to quit because it will make me feel better and it will give me more energy.'' Still, there's one in every crowd. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Farnham </PERSON>, a reporter for Fortune magazine in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gathered 40 `` like-minded people'' for a tongue-in-cheek `` smoke-in'' at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> restaurant. `` By reducing stress, tobacco adds years to life,'' <PERSON> Farnham </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Galen </PERSON>, the Greek physician, believed tobacco adds years to life.''

 Convicted spy <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> says he deserved to be punished for giving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secrets to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but claims in a television interview that his life sentence is unfair.

But he said there was `` an explanation.'' <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said he acted for `` soft reasons having to do with a family that was destroyed in the holocaust. Having to do with the realization that this government in the 40s had abandoned the Jewish people to its fate in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' `` The hard reason why I did what I did ... -LRB- was that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy -RRB- was fundamentally to place <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in a position where she would be forced to make an unenviable choice between a ruinous war or shameful peace,'' he said. The interview took place at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION>'s maximum security penitentiary in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> in the presence of two <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Intelligence officials. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> was sentenced to life imprisonment in March 1987 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage. His wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson-Pollard </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to receive embezzled government property and being an accessory after the fact to the possession of national defense secrets. She was sentenced to five years in prison. <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said he considered his sentence unfair because <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is an ally and he did not give it information damaging to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests. `` My sentence did not reflect proportional justice, it reflected political vengeance, plain and simple,'' <PERSON> Pollard </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Women's Abilities Vary with Hormone Levels</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Last graf may be offensive to some readers.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ability of women to perform certain tasks varies with the level of their sex hormones, a study has found. The research is believed to be the first linking human performance to sex hormones. The study by Dr. <PERSON> Doreen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, shows women perform significantly better in verbal fluency and fine-motor muscular control when their estrogen and progesterone levels are high. <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>'s study also showed that women's ability to understand spatial concepts is enhanced by lower hormone levels. The researcher said similar patterns probably occur in men, whose sex hormone testosterone fluctuates daily. <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>, who spoke Wednesday at a news briefing during the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neuroscience </ORGANIZATION>, tested 200 women during their menstrual cycle and post-menopausal women on estrogen-replacement therapy. She compared their spatial cognition and verbal and motor abilities during times of peak and low hormone levels. The levels rise and fall during the course of a woman's menstrual cycle. The peak estrogen phase begins just before ovulation and extends until a week to 10 days before menstruation. A drop in hormone levels occurs during menstruation. Spatial tasks which <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON> tested involved identifying a shape in a complex pattern. Tongue-twisters tested verbal skills, and fine-motor tasks included rapid changing of hand postures. Men generally do better on such spatial problems, but women on average score better on the verbal and fine-motor tasks. In the low-hormone phase, it might take a woman three seconds longer to repeat a tongue-twister correctly than during her peak level, the researcher said. `` With motor-tasks, women say, ` Gosh, I'm really clumsy this week,''' said <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>. She said her study supports the idea that male-female cognitive differences are influenced by sex hormones acting on the brain. She said she is now studying how men's abilities might vary according to the level of testosterone. `` It's easier to identify these things in women, but my guess is they can happen also in males,'' said <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>. She acknowledged that the study suggests there may be optimal times for women to perform certain tasks, such as taking standardized academic examinations. `` We really do n't know enough yet,'' she said. `` It may be in a couple of years we'll know enough about it to say there are significant enough effects that these can be factors in test scores and performance.'' <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON> stressed that abilities vary greatly among individual men and women, with some women better at tasks in which men generally excel. `` There's an enormous overlap in the ability patterns between men and women,'' she said. `` You do n't have to look at a person's genitals to decide whether they're going to be a good air traffic controller. You can give them a test of spatial ability.''

<HEAD>U.N. Report Says Afghan Human Rights Situation Improves</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> UNITED </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NATIONS </ORGANIZATION> _ A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said Thursday that the human rights situation in <LOCATION> Afghanstan </LOCATION> improved somewhat in government-controlled areas, but it said acts of terrorism by rebels increased in the past year. The 37-page annual human rights report on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> said that while the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> Agreements, signed April 14, `` give grounds for hope, the special rapporteur -LRB- the person assigned to prepare the report -RRB- has still not been able to report any improvement in the human rights situation within the country. `` Acts of war are continuing, violations of human rights are at least as frequent as in the past, affecting particularly the civilian population and endangering the lives and security of innocent men, women and children.'' The rapporteur, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Ermacora </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, is the special investigator of the Afghan human rights situation for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A similar report last year said the main problem in realizating human rights there was the presence of more than 100,000 Soviet troops. Half of them have been withdrawn under U.N.-mediated agreements signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. The rest are to be pulled out by Feb. 15, although <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has suspended its withdrawal because of increasing attacks by U.S.-backed and Pakistan-based rebels. The report said, `` In general, there is greater improvement in the human rights situation in government-controlled areas. However, allegations of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners on remand -LRB- awaiting trial -RRB- and political prisoners are still being received,'' he said. Afghan authorities reject the allegations. <PERSON> Ermacora </PERSON> said the number of political prisoners has fallen sharply as a result of anmnesty decress and other measures under the Afghan government policy of national reconciliation. Conditions of detention in <LOCATION> Pol-i-Charkhi </LOCATION> prison, a major center, have improved, it said. But the investigator also said that after the signing of the <ORGANIZATION> Geneva </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agreements </ORGANIZATION>, which Afghan rebels rejected, `` acts of terrorism ... have caused many deaths among innocent civilians.'' `` Terrorism in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> has multipled,'' since his report last year, he said. The report cited government reports of rebel violence from April to last August. It said heavy artillery and ground-to-ground missiles were used against towns and villages, charitable institutions and mosques. The report cited 4,154 cases of missile firings and 24 explosions, killing 945 civilians and wounding 1,895, including 187 children and 98 women. It said a rocket attack on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> killed nine civilians on Sept. 1 and wounded 20. On Sept. 27, a rocket attack on a <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> neighborhood reportedly killed 35 civilians Afghan refugees in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, it said, still are afraid to return home, largely because of rebel-planted mines. The report said withdrawing Soviet troops had committed human rights violations and it cited reports of Soviet bombing and bombardment of civilian areas. On March 7, it said, Soviet artillery bombarded residential areas in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Herat </LOCATION>, at the end of April migrating nomads were attacked by Soviet and Afghan troops and houses, schools and mosques were damaged and destroyed in other Soviet attacks. `` Many Afghan villages and houses have been destroyed in the course of the Soviet troop withdrawal and many civilians have been killed due to the fighting tactics of the oppostion movements and acts of retaliation,'' the report said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> report said treatment of prisoners of war violates the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Prisoners are used as a means of barganing and exchange, it said. The whereabouts of at least 313 Soviet soldiers missing in action is still unknown, it said. The Afghan government considers rebels to be terrorists and not combatants to be treated in accordance with international humanitarian law, it said. The report said the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> should be given full access to all prisons and detention centers.

 An American TV news camerawoman has died of hepatitis while traveling in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to cover the war, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Her name was being withheld pending notification of her family, said a duty officer. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> said the woman was a free-lancer on assignment for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. He said it was not determined immediately whether she worked as a camera operator, sound person or in some other capacity, `` but she was obviously a member of a news crew.'' Afghan guerrilla sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the woman died Tuesday near <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as the rebels tried to get her to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for medical treatment. Her body was delivered to the Americans on Thursday in <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, for shipment home. Official Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> reported that a foreign journalist was robbed and killed by guerrillas near the same city and on the same day as the woman. There was no confirmation of that report. It was unclear whether it was the Marxist government's version of the same death. Radio <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> has reported several Americans and other foreigners killed recently in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, allegedly while helping the rebels. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have described the claims as fabrications. They deny that any non-embassy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel are in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> support the insurgents in their struggle to oust the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government and drive out the Soviet forces who bolster it. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has pledged to remove all its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> made false statements about his predecessor when he accused him of smoking marijuana, sources said Thursday. The allegations were rejected by a federal inquiry. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> had told investigators he saw his predecessor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, smoking marijuana at a 1982 party in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. But the report of a 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe released Wednesday found `` no evidence whatsoever'' to support the claim. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> later headed the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> issued a two-sentence statement responding to the report, which was filed in federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` Upon receiving the report released by the court, I immediately requested that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> conduct a prompt and thorough investigation to resolve any suggestion of impropriety by me raised in the report,'' <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> said. `` I will continue to cooperate with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in every way in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible,'' he said. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s secretary said he was out of his office and unavailable for comment. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> declined to comment on whether <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> was under investigation. But federal law enforcement sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> was investigating whether <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> made false statements about <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, who was appointed by <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> in April 1985, said <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s allegation about <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> was `` just not possible.'' `` Everybody who has worked with him knows him to be completely apolitical as a prosecutor and a straight-arrow,'' <PERSON> Markham </PERSON> said in an interview Thursday. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> nominated <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> to succeed <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> in April 1987, a few months after <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> was appointed to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. An internal <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo on which <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s court filing was based said that after he went to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, conflict developed between <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and the office of then-Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>, a deputy assistant attorney general who was helping to shepherd <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>'s nomination as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, told investigators that <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> requested him to call <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> to `` dig up some dirt'' on <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, who told investigators <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> opposed his nomination and believed <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> was trying to scuttle it, then told <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> that he had seen <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> drunk on a couple of occasions and had seen him smoking a `` joint'' at a party after a wedding in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in 1982. The memo said it is unclear whether <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON>, who said he had no specific recollection of briefing <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, reported back what <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> had said. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on March 29 to protest former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s continued tenure. Asked whether he believed <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> had requested officials to `` dig up dirt,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said Thursday: `` I've spoken to <PERSON> Arnie </PERSON> and there's no misunderstanding between us as to the events at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said his relations with <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> are good. He declined further comment. <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> on Wednesday labeled as `` categorically untrue'' the allegation that he told <PERSON> Byrnes </PERSON> to call <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> about <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> memo also said <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> that he had smoked marijuana as recently as four years ago.

 The government said Thursday that U.S.-backed rebels kidnapped 11 government officials who were inspecting hurricane damage in an eastern province. A statement from the president's office said rebels abducted the health, agriculture and finance officials Saturday near <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> town </LOCATION>, about 220 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. It said the officials were evaluating damage caused by Hurricane Joan, which struck <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Oct. 22. The leftist Sandinista government appealed to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> for the safety of the captives. Neighboring <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is used as a base by rebel troops. The rebels, known as Contras, made no immediate response to the government claim. The government and rebels signed a cease-fire agreement in March, but talks on ending the 7-year-old civil war collapsed in September. Each side accuses the other of truce violations.

 Severe textbook shortages are undercutting education in urban school districts nationwide because of higher book prices, budgetary constraints and a tendency to cut books before people, educators complain. `` One of the things about textbooks is they do n't vote and they do n't go out on strike.

 The author of one of the first novels to give Americans a look into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Cuban community laughs about the critical success of his work. `` I think what's caught the attention probably -LRB- is -RRB- it's the first book about Cuban-Americans, the first novel in English that takes place in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said in a recent interview in his office at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he teaches Latin American literature. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 37, has three books to his credit _ the first in a mixture of Spanish and English called `` Spanglish,'' the second in Spanish, and the third, `` Raining Backwards,'' in English. `` One day I was writing and everything was coming out more or less in English,'' he said. `` And I said, ` Let's give it a try and see what happens.''' What happened was a novel that reviewers have compared to the works of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Burroughs </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Borges </PERSON>. `` Sometimes you want to believe it and sometimes you say, ` Well, is it true or what?''' the author said. He described `` Raining Backwards'' as a work that looks at how immigrants cope with their new reality. `` And there's a lot of fantasy _ not fantasy _ myth-creation.'' The title comes from a prediction made by one of the novel's characters, an elderly woman who wants to travel from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in a canoe so she can be buried in her homeland Once she lands, she plans to wave a white flag and grab a cab to the cemetery. Then, she thinks, it will begin to rain backwards. `` You create myths to justify yourself in this new environment. And the myths suddenly become _ I mean you start with a myth and then you do n't know where reality is and where the myth is. So life has become sort of chaotic. And in a way, I guess, out of that chaos you make more myths to make ... sense,'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. He thinks the themes of `` Raining Backwards'' are universal. `` I think everybody fantasizes when you move from one place to another. It does n't have to be <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. It could be <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It could be here from to, I do n't know, to <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> or something.'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> when he was about 10 with his parents and older brother, spends his summer vacations and holidays in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, where many of his relatives live. The bulk of `` Raining Backwards'' was written in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> last summer, but the ideas came to him in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. The book has a certain vitality to it, the author said. `` I think the book is alive, has spark in it,'' he said. `` Lately <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> literature has been a little dry. I mean it's perfect technically but there's something _ no spark there.'' Writing `` Raining Backwards'' was fun, according to <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who writes in long-hand on legal pads and later transfers his work to a word processor. `` I was laughing,'' he said. `` As a matter of fact, I was living in that world. I would n't go out. They'd say ` You like to go out?' No, I want to go home and write.'' <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, who thinks he expresses himself better in writing, can remember writing in school when he first came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and he could n't understand what the teacher was saying. Those early days were sad and bewildering ones for his family. `` At the beginning we thought that it was going to be like we were going to be here for a couple of months and then it would be for a couple of years and then it's been now like 26 years or something like that,'' he said. `` So at the beginning I mean we just _ I mean you did n't know what to expect, it was sort of like, more or less scared. You know, trying to keep a low profile kind of thing,'' he recalled. His books, however, are not autobiographical, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said. `` They are a composite of different people that I have seen in different experiences. And those characters are out there, you know, if you pay a little attention,'' he said. `` If you pay a little attention, you hear a lot of outrageous things.'' And <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> does n't consider himself an exile writer. `` Maybe you can say I'm an American writer of Cuban extraction, writing about the things he knows.''

 A cultural gap almost kept <PERSON> Maruschka </PERSON> <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> from playing a part for which she thought she was destined. The Dutch-born actress had read the script for `` <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>'s War,'' a film based on the true story of a young Hungarian who stood up to the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, and considered herself perfect for the lead. `` I recognized something that was meant for me,'' <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> said. `` I knew that I was going to do that. I came there totally calm, I did n't feel I had to convince anybody.'' Except the director, <PERSON> Menaham </PERSON> <PERSON> Golan </PERSON> -LRB- `` Over the Top,'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'' -RRB-, who insisted that <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> test for the part. `` I could see his point,'' the actress said. `` Nobody knows me in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This project is something he wanted to do for a long, long time. In <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, it's not very usual for people to have a screen test unless you're just beginning. Here, it's very normal to ask for one.'' But <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> did n't feel that way at the time. She told <PERSON> Golan </PERSON> there was no reason to audition and walked off the set. `` It was not a tactic at all. I went back to the hotel not even thinking about the consequences of what I had done. I was already arranging for my ticket back to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>,'' the actress said with a laugh. And then, in true Hollywood fashion, <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> got another chance. <PERSON> Golan </PERSON> called her and asked if he could stop by. The director arrived with a script under his arm. `` He said, ` Let me read for you,''' <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> recalled. `` He's a big man. If you saw <PERSON> Menaham </PERSON>, you could imagine how touching it was from him to read a poem of <PERSON> Hannah </PERSON>'s when she was 16 years old. He started reading and I said, ` OK, I'll read the poem.' `` I read two lines and he said, ` OK, OK. You do n't have to go on, it's you it's you!''' It was n't the first time that the 24-year-old <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> had taken a chance. At 18, she went to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to pursue a career in theater. Two problems: She could n't speak French and had no acting experience. `` It was n't much of a risk,'' she shrugged. `` They chose me as the first one of 750 people in some kind of selection thing. An agent signed me up when I did n't even know what an agent was. I knew that it was logical. I was never surprised.'' <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> was n't so nonchalant about her debut film, `` Prenom: <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>,'' directed by <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Godard </PERSON> -LRB- `` Breathless,'' `` Band of Outsiders'' -RRB-, who helped lead the French `` New Wave'' explosion in the late 1950s. `` I can either talk about him for three days without interruption or just say it was extremely confusing and difficult. He was not nice at all. After two weeks he was telling everybody how bad they were.'' But she felt she understood what made <PERSON> Godard </PERSON> so difficult to work with. `` He is extremely sensitive to absolute things in life. Absolute whenever they happen, nobody talks, nobody writes, nobody speaks, nobody films. As soon as you film something or write something, you start the betrayal of the idea that something is absolute.'' While <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> enjoyed an easier relationship with <PERSON> Golan </PERSON> on the set of `` <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>'s War,'' she still found the film an overwhelming experience. `` I was just walking with this bubble around me. Sometimes people did n't dare approach me. I just could n't keep my mind on anything else. Wherever <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> went she had this incredible impact on people. She was converted into some kind of spiritual center. `` I'm sorry if I use pompous words, but it's the only way I can talk about her.'' <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Senesh </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in 1921 and grew up in a well-to-do family. She showed an early talent for writing and hoped to study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budapest </ORGANIZATION>. But with the rise of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, she fled to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> when she was 17 and became passionate about furthering the cause of a Jewish homeland. <PERSON> Senesh </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> in 1944 and joined the fight to defend Jews against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, who now occupied the country. `` I understood what was pushing her,'' <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> said. `` The force behind everything she did was neither a religious ideal nor a political conviction nor some kind of an opinion about something, it was a life force itself.'' `` People use the word ` courage' when they talk about her. I do n't think courage ever came into her mind She was just doing what she had to do.'' <PERSON> Senesh </PERSON> was eventually convicted for treason by a military court in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and executed. In her closing statement to the court, she delivered a powerful denunciation of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and their collaborators. <PERSON> Detmers </PERSON> took great pride in the filming of the courtroom scene. `` It was so well constructed, that speech,'' she said. `` It was exactly what she was about. In filming, I hardly ever feel anything joyous. Everything in the film seems to be made to keep the actors from doing what they have to accomplish, but that speech was really nice to do.''

<HEAD>Thailand Seeks Business Links with Indochina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY MOLLY YONG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has begun looking to its communist-governed neighbors as trading partners after shunning them since the <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> war years. Calling for increased commerce with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> businessmen voice fear they are being outdone by counterparts from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, which are drawing $ 200 million to $ 300 million a year in a low profile but brisk trade. As <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> liberalizes its underdeveloped economy, Thai businessmen and some legislators worry that if they act too slowly <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> along with <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> will corner a market that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> is in a favorable geographic position to penetrate. Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> <PERSON> Choonhavan </PERSON>, himself a businessman, started talking about improving general relations with <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> as well as exploring economic opportunities shortly after taking office in August. Already Thai businessmen are angling for fishing licenses in bountiful Vietnamese waters and sending agricultural experts to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> to supervise an experimental farm while importing Laotian timber. Laotians shop at a Thai-run department store in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>, the Laotian capital, and a Thai company recently entered into the first major joint venture project in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, the construction of a garment factory. But officially <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> has thus far had no government-to-government economic transactions with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> since its troops invaded neighboring <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> policy has been one of putting pressure on the Vietnamese in all fields. The Thai government also offers no help to private entrepreneurs doing business with <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, but it generally turns a blind eye to the vast black market trade across its borders with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` We have lost time and lost out to countries that actively traded with <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> regardless of their government's strong opposition to Vietnamese troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Wongse </PERSON> <PERSON> Polnikorn </PERSON>, a former deputy foreign minister and currently chairman of a Thai company that will import timber from <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and set up a cash-crop farm in <LOCATION> Vientiane </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Chatichai </PERSON> has instructed that the number of goods officially banned for export to <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> be halved to 30, according to government spokesman <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yodmani </PERSON>. Since the 1975 communist victories in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, periodic skirmishes _ as well as two major confrontations _ have erupted along the Thai-Laotian border. Similar clashes have occurred between Thais and Vietnamese along the Thai-Cambodian frontier. Last year, two-way trade between <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> topped $ 48 million, although the black market, or `` unofficial,'' trade is known to be far higher. Two-way trade with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> rose to $ 7.5 million last year from $ 4.8 million in 1986 while Thai exports to <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> were $ 400,000 in 1986. But some in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which has traditionally been suspicious of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s longterm intentions in the region, view a prosperous <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> as potentially dangerous and expansionist. `` If we can make <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> prosperous, ourselves prosperous, that's great, but what is there to guarantee that <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wo n't move into <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s northeast,'' spokesman <PERSON> Suvit </PERSON> said in an interview `` Once it's prosperous, then it can afford to keep troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Surin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitsuwan </PERSON>, a leading member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, suggested that <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> at first proceed cautiously in trading with <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, a country with which it shares ethnic and cultural bonds and which poses no major security threat. He also suggested more economic dealings with <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, with which official, two-way trade totaled $ 544 million in 1987. `` There are a lot of trade opportunities and untapped resources next door,'' <PERSON> Surin </PERSON> said. `` If we do n't hurry now, the degree of their dependence on us will be reduced.'' Although <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> will be hard pressed to compete with Japanese technology and funding, businessmen say the Thais could carve out a profitable <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION> niche in such areas as agro-industry, fishing, forestry and smaller-scale construction. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, where the economy is booming and consumer spending on an upward curve, could also serve as a market for Indochinese goods. While war has largely wrecked economic infrastructure in <LOCATION> Indochina </LOCATION>, the three countries possess large untapped natural resources and an abundance of cheap labor. `` We must go and explore ways we can do more and benefit from one another,'' said <PERSON> Kangwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tantiponganant </PERSON>, a businessmen involved in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>. Given the political sensitivities, other Thai businessmen prefer to make low-keyed trips to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION>, emphasizing that their interests are in `` long-term business planning.''

<HEAD>Surplus-Agency Chief Deals in Federal Bargains, From Bolts To

 In his pursuit of a bargain for taxpayers, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> has flown into the mountains of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to retrieve an old pickup truck with bad tires and no rear lights, driving it home to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. He has wangled his way into government vaults and come out with an Oriental rug <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> could n't use, and procured shelving and two office cubicles discarded by the White House. <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel, former narcotics agent and one-time school superintendent, makes big deals, too. As director of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surplus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Property </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> is trying at the moment to get his hands on 12 used helicopters no longer wanted by the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rucker </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, so he can give them to state police and a flight school in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. Note the word `` give.'' <PERSON> Alexio </PERSON> insists he does n't sell a thing he brokers. But for a relatively small price that covers the cost of his operation, <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> obtains surplus federal property and passes it on to state and municipal governments, schools and non-profit organizations such as nursing homes and halfway houses. A relatively small price? How does $ 150 sound for a $ 1,840.56 medical centrifuge -LRB- like new -RRB-? Or $ 2,500 for a used $ 200,000 road grader? The 9-by-12-foot <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> rug was a gift from <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> that the then-secretary of state could n't accept. It now warms the toes of some <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> government official, a bargain at $ 150. Every state has a surplus agency, under a law <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted after World War II to make sure the states shared in the federal leftovers. Customers are restricted to government entities, educational institutions and non-profit health agencies. There are 1,800 certified customers around the country. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, there's a twice-yearly junkyard sale, but otherwise <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON>'s warehouses are closed to the public. His customers say access to the surplus stuff helps. `` It's tremendous,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Broderick </PERSON>, who for 15 years has been buying surplus goods for the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, an agency that oversees highways, sewers and other projects that cross juridictions in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area. Government surplus kept the commission rolling a decade ago while waiting for a bond issue to buy new vehicles. For instance, tractor-trailers were supplied for a song: $ 5,000 apiece for a set of four that would have cost $ 65,000 each new. The <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> command bus, a headquarters on wheels, was once a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> mobile tracking station. `` We paid no more than $ 1,000 for it. A nice piece of equipment that would have cost us $ 55,000 to $ 60,000.'' `` This is the cheapest way the government has of getting rid of its property,'' <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> said. `` Most of the money goes back to the taxpayer.'' Customers pay about 3 cents on the original dollar cost to the government. Even so, <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON>'s self-supporting operation is in the red trying to cover its $ 450,000 annual operating costs, including a staff of 12. Since the late 1970s, federal agencies have become more economy minded. `` That is good, but there's a point where it's more cost-effective to buy something new,'' rather than fix the old, <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> said. He reckons the state government saves $ 1 million a year picking through his warehouse. The assorted other customers save $ 5 million to $ 6 million. Rotund and low to the ground, <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> is an intense man with a sense of purpose and a one-liner to describe his work: `` We get all the bang that's left in the buck.'' Even the warehouses storing the goods are hand-me-downs. A pair of long gray metal-clad buildings at the back of an industrial park, they were erected in 1942 as an assembly point for soldiers shipping off to fight World War II. Inside, every truck, electron microscope and box of bolts, gets a number. Items that cost the government more than $ 5,000 when new must be used by the receiver within a year. If not, the new owner does n't get title to the object and it is considered stolen property Items costing more than $ 10,000 must be used within 36 months. What's in the inventory? Dental file cabinets, an oboe and half a piccolo, tons of bolts for building bridges, metal and wood desks in various stages of decrepitude from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a brass bedstead once belonging to a naval computer testing equipment, computer circuit boards, air conditioner filters. Also: leftover pipe from a submarine, ice skates, map file drawers, machine tool drills, typewriters and calculators, chairs, an aircraft camera, tool boxes, an offset press, and Army-green gas tanks among the takings when a government supplier came under criminal scrutiny and the relationship ended. So what can agencies or schools do with, say, a jet engine container or 2,000 feet of 2-inch plastic tubing? `` I advise them to send a creative person, a person with a spirit of innovation who can see a new way to use something,'' <PERSON> Aleixo </PERSON> said. `` The kids from MIT. They're probably our biggest customers.''

 Every day is Thanksgiving Day at the Rainbow Kitchen, one of hundreds of American soup kitchens where hunger never takes a holiday. `` These people need help year-round, not just during the holidays,'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said as he stocked the Rainbow Kitchen's pantry with canned goods `` This is one of those thousand points of light -LRB- President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talks about,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a former steel worker. `` But there's no reason this kind of charity should have to exist. We just keep going because we do n't want to see people turned away.'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> opened the Rainbow Kitchen in 1984 after the sharp decline of steel and heavy manufacturing left thousands jobless in <LOCATION> Homestead </LOCATION>, a historic steel town adjacent to <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The Rainbow Kitchen is one cog amid all the soup lines, food banks, churches and senior citizen centers nationwide that make up an ever-growing, mostly volunteer and imperfect machine that distributes millions of pounds of free food every year. `` We never thought we'd be in operation this long,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` The number of people we serve just keeps growing and growing.'' Homestead's Eighth Avenue bustled when <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION>'s sprawling Homestead Works was turning out giant steel slabs into the early 1980s. But the mill is cold and shuttered now, and business on the avenue is slower. At noon each day, a quiet line forms outside the <LOCATION> Rainbow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kitchen </LOCATION>, where hot lunches are served to an average of 185 people. `` We get a mixture of people,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` It used to be a lot more unemployed people. I think now it's more underemployed people. I see more children than I'd like to see here. We get whole families.'' One recent chilly afternoon, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, 25, expressed gratitude as she and two of her three young children munched on hamburger patties, pasta and potato salad served on plastic plates. `` I'm not ashamed. I'm not rich,'' she said. `` This is decent. They make sure you're full when you leave.'' Ms. <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, single and unemployed, said she has looked for work, but `` they are n't hiring.'' She said she ca n't get by on food stamps, so she eats at the kitchen several times a week. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> operates the Rainbow Kitchen on $ 125,000 a year. Most of the money comes from small donations, although rock star <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Springstein </PERSON> donated $ 10,000 in 1985. `` Sometimes we run out of food and just hold up the line,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` We open up some big cans of beans or something and just start making sandwiches like crazy.'' Every Thursday, the Rainbow Kitchen opens its pantry to about 700 families who are given a bag or two of groceries. Since 1980, changes by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration have narrowed eligibility for food stamps and therefore reduced the amount going out. Last year, the federal government spent $ 10.59 billion for food stamps, compared with $ 11.98 billion in 1980, according to <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> figures adjusted for inflation. In that time, the number of people receiving food stamps declined by about 900,000, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> said. In roughly the same period, from 1979 to the present, the number of people living below the poverty line of $ 11,600 annual income for a family of four has grown by 6 million, the government reports. Many people eligible for food stamps either do n't apply or are wrongly rejected, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON>, executive director of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> On average, food stamp recipients each month get stamps worth about 54 cents per meal, although <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON> said some elderly individuals get as little as $ 10 a month. It's therefore no surprise many run out of money at month's end and turn to pantries and soup kitchens for help, he said. `` The number of people needing food by the end of the month has risen,'' <PERSON> Fersh </PERSON> said. `` The people who rely on the safety net not only have had food assistance cut but have to pay more for medical care and utilities.'' Annual surveys by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> reveal a steady increase in the need for emergency food, said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, assistant executive director of the group. A survey of 26 cities found two-thirds of those who needed food in 1987 were families with children, she said. `` You think of the traditional soup kitchen user as the single man or the single woman, but we know there are more and more families,'' Ms. <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said. The heart of the nation's grassroots food distribution is the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which began in 1979 in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. Last year, Second Harvest, now based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, distributed about 387 million pounds of food. Its 205 affiliated food banks served 38,000 local charities, including pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and day-care and senior citizen centers. Yet the need for more food is constant. `` What I generally hear are stories of a food pantry that is so strapped for food and money that it is only able to supply three days' supply of food per family per month regardless of the depth of the family's need,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, public policy manager for Second Harvest. Many of the nation's food banks started in church basements with one vehicle to haul food, but the average food bank today has several trucks and handles 3 million to 6 million pounds of food a year, <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> boasts a 160,000-square-foot warehouse in nearby <LOCATION> McKeesport </LOCATION> that was bought after a fund-raising drive led by two local banks. In 1987, the food bank distributed about 7.3 million pounds of food to about 300 affiliates, including the Rainbow Kitchen, said Executive Director <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothermal </PERSON>. More than half the food bank's supplies are donated by Second Harvest, grocery stores and individuals. Some are bought with state money, a small portion with federal money and the remainder with food bank money. `` There's a group of people who are really bad off,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rothermal </PERSON> said. `` It's falling to the private sector to help them.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> MariAn </PERSON> <PERSON> Halt </PERSON> of Homestead, who have a teen-age son and daughter, were among those crowded into the Rainbow Kitchen on a recent Thursday waiting with paper bags and carts to pick up a slab of butter, a carton of eggs and other groceries. `` We usually make the food stretch, but we sometimes get a little close,'' said Halt, 47. He said heart problems forced him in 1986 to quit his job as a caseworker for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know what we'd do without these food banks,'' Halt said.

 The dollar plunged Wednesday as bearish sentiment overwhelmed the government's report of a narrowing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit. Bond prices declined sharply in response to the falling dollar. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 38.59 to 2,038.58, its lowest close since it stood at 2,002.31 on Sept. 1. Crude futures prices fell; cocoa futures prices surged; silver futures sagged while gold futures were little changed; copper futures retreated; grains were lower; soybeans were higher; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.

 Oil futures prices have turned mixed as traders keep their attention on the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meetings scheduled for this week. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 23 cents Wednesday to settle at $ 13.67 a barrel, after falling 37 cents on Tuesday. Other contract months also lost ground. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Wednesday, the December contract for unleaded gasoline settled at 46.50 cents a gallon, down 0.46 cent. The contract had fallen 1.20 cents Tuesday. The December contract for wholesale home heating oil, which fell 0.23 cent in the previous session, rose 0.07 cent to settle at 44.47 cents a gallon. Ministers from eight <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations were gathering today for pricing and strategy committee meetings in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, wich were to be followed by a full meeting of all 13 ministers on Monday. Analysts said reports that daily <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> crude production has reached 22.5 million barrels depressed some prices Wednesday, but they said traders were optimistic cartel members would work at upcoming meetings toward eliminating the worldwide oil glut. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has a self-imposed daily production limit of about 15 million barrels. However, a number of members are believed to be ignoring their individual limits. Overproduction has added to an already glutted world market and pushed crude prices well below <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark of $ 18 a barrel.

 Facing the prospect of fresh declines in world oil prices, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> chiefs gathering today in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> are under pressure to fashion a new agreement that will control the cartel's surging production and help bolster crude prices Ministers from eight of the 13 nations that make up the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were meeting for talks on bringing order to the chaotic oil market. `` There is a feeling they have to come up with a new -LRB- production -RRB- agreement,'' said one <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` They will work very hard at it because of the consequence of failure ... a collapse in prices,'' he said. The eight ministers are meeting in a joint session of two <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> committees, in talks that could run into the weekend. On Monday, all 13 ministers are to meet for the cartel's winter meeting. At issue is the thorny problem of how to address the cartel's recently skyrocketing output, which has added to an already glutted world market Analysts say most <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members have exceeded their production quotas, partly to press for position in advance of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meetings. As a result, prices have slipped $ 4 or more below <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel A barrel is equivalent to 42 gallons. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the December contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, fell 23 cents Wednesday to settle at $ 13.67 a barrel, after falling 37 cents on Tuesday. The recent declines reflect how dramatically <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production has risen. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimated in its Monthly Oil Market Report that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> production was nearly 21.1 million barrels a day in October, the highest monthly output in more than five years. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s official total production quota under a December 1986 arrangement is about 15 million barrels a day. That excludes <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has ignored its limit. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Antill </PERSON>, oil analyst at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> brokerage <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> NatWest </ORGANIZATION>, estimated next year's demand for <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil at 18.7 million barrels a day. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanislaw </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, speculated that a new accord might set total output at 19 million to 19.5 million barrels a day. A key to a new quota agreement is bringing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back into the system. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ the world's largest oil exporter and <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s most influential member _ and <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> have insisted that a fresh accord must include all members. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> recently increased its production to more than 6 million barrels a day, well above its ceiling of 4.3 million barrels, in an attempt to pressure other cartel members to obey their quotas. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has refused to obey its daily ceiling of 1.5 million barrels because it wanted parity with war rival <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has a quota of 2.4 million barrels. The two countries agreed to an August cease-fire in their 8-year-old war, and both want to earn more oil revenue to pay for rebuilding their war-ravaged economies. Analysts estimated <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been producing at least 2.6 million barrels a day, and could boost production to 3.7 million barrels next year with completion of a new pipeline through <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to the Red Sea. Under a new system, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> might each get a quota of 2.6 million barrels, analysts predicted. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers also must deal with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emirates </ORGANIZATION>' refusal to stick to its quota of 948,000 million barrels a day It independently has boosted its limit to 1.5 million barrels. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price evolution committee, meeting Thursday with the long-term strategy panel, is made up of <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The strategy committee's members are <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. Other <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Grand Met Seeking To Block Burger King Spinoff; Pillsbury Won't

 <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> says it is going to court to try and block <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to spin off its Burger King fast-food chain, the key element in <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s attempt to thwart Grand Met's hostile $ 5.23 billion takeover bid. The spinoff, set for Dec. 2, is part of a defensive restructuring the food and restaurant company announced after rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Met </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 60 a share tender offer as inadequate on Oct. 17. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> contends its shareholders would be better off with the restructuring, in which they would receive a special dividend and stock in the newly separate Burger King, which accounts for a huge chunk of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s revenues but is slumping. But Grand Met claims it would have to lower its buyout offer should the spinoff occur, because the restructured company would present a huge tax liability for Grand Met. Grand Met said Wednesday it planned to ask for a temporary restraining order in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chancery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where Chancellor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> has said he would hold a hearing Nov. 28. According to Grand Met, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> also said he would set a hearing for Dec. 12 on Grand Met's renewed motion to invalidate <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense The tender offer, which has been extended three times, is conditioned on the removal of the pill, which would make a takeover prohibitively expensive. Dissident shareholders also have sued to have the pill invalidated, but courts in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> have left it intact. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at $ 56 Wednesday, down $ 2 a share in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. In another matter, documents from both companies filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> indicate <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected a telephone request from Grand Met Chairman <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> to meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss the tender offer. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> on Wednesday renewed his criticism of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s stance. `` We are amazed at the negative response to our overture, given that almost 80 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> shares had been tendered to Grand Met as of Nov. 14,'' <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> had no comment. In its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> in their phone discussion that he saw no purpose in meeting. `` Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> noted ... that if Mr. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> had anything additional for the board to consider, he would report it to the board,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> document said. In Grand Met's account of the telephone conversation, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he was led to believe from media reports and company statements that Grand Met was firm on the price of its tender offer. `` Mr. <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON> indicated that while he presently saw no reason to increase the offer price, he had heard that Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was a very good salesman and was prepared to listen to any argument that Mr. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> might have regarding why Grand Met ought to pay more than $ 60 a share,'' Grand Met stated.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is asking its stockholders to wait two weeks before deciding whether to sell their shares under a $ 970 million takeover offer made by a small <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> computer maker. On Wednesday, one day after the unsolicited offer by <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBow </PERSON>, Prime also announced that its president, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, was stepping down six weeks earlier than planned. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> said in a statement that the takeover bid `` makes it desirable to complete the transition now so Prime can be represented by the man who will have responsibility for leading it in the future.'' <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> was named on Oct. 3 to succeed <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> but was not due to take over until the end of the year. MAI Basic, which already owns 4.1 percent of Prime's 48.5 million shares outstanding, is offering $ 20 a share for the remaining stock. Prime closed Wednesday at $ 17 a share, down 75 cents in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. MAI Basic fell 37 -LCB- cents to $ 11 a share. Natick-based Prime in February acquired <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 435 million to become the second-leading supplier behind <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in the field of computer-aided design and manufacturing systems. Prime last month bolstered its position by acquiring <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Calma </LOCATION> business, which also makes CAD-CAM systems. MAI Basic, which is about one-quarter the size of Prime, makes business computers and information processing systems. In a statement Wednesday, Prime said its board of directors would meet `` in due course'' to discuss the MAI Basic bid, which is being made by a wholly owned subsidiary set up specifically for the takeover, <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The company said it will notify shareholders of its decision by Nov. 29. <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has conditioned the bid on at least 67 percent of shares being tendered by the offer's Dec. 13 expiration. MAI Basic said it filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking to block Prime's new poison-pill takeover defense from taking effect. The company also has begun litigation against Prime in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> seeking to overturn a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law that limits takeover attempts.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s refusal to import <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice is the work of an `` evil empire'' that manipulates the Japanese agricultural business, according to the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON>, president of the association that groups rice producers in six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states, said Thursday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could start easing some of its social problems _ such as high land, housing and food prices _ by liberalizing its heavily-controlled rice market. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in late October rejected a petition by the <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Millers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with a complaint against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ban on rice imports, but also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s policy contravened trade agreements and the millers' complaint could be reintroduced if there is no progress in easing the ban. After laborious negotiations earlier this year, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> agreed to accept more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and oranges. But it firmly has rejected calls to open its rice market. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> is <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s staple food and the government's policy of self-sufficiency in rice it requires massive subsidies to farmers. Retail rice prices are at least triple <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prices. <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> told a news conference with foreign journalists that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rice policy `` is a fantastic example of economic distortion, and it basically stinks.'' He said bureaucrats in the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> have no understanding of economic reality, and sharply criticized the nation's network of agricultural cooperatives, which are powerful political lobbyists with huge economic resources. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rice policy, <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> said, `` is tied to a cooperative framework which I would characterize as basically an evil empire.'' The cooperative movement is supposed to help Japanese farmers and consumers, he said, but `` it exploits farmers and gouges consumers.'' <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> proposed a 2.5 percent a year opening of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rice market over a four-year period. Ten percent of the rice market would be as much as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> growers could produce, he said, noting that 25 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice fields now are out of production. If <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> liberalizes its market, he predicted Japanese farmers would become more efficient, that land and housing prices would go down because some paddy land would be freed for housing, and that Japanese consumers could spend less on agricultural products and more on manufactured imports, thus further helping the country reduce its huge trade surplus. <PERSON> Gabbert </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which he said he had visited 20 times in the past 15 years, to study his association's options as it decides what to do next in its drive to penetrate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s rice market.

<HEAD>Dollar Plummets, Gold Also Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell in European trading today, reaching its lowest level against major foreign currencies in more than five months. Gold prices also fell. The slight improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in September, announced on Wednesday, was not enough to reverse the downward pressure on the dollar, foreign currency dealers said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed to $ 10.46 billion from $ 12.18 billion in August. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell to a 15-year low against the Japanese yen, closing at 121.52 yen, despite reported central bank intervention. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 122.00 yen. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> reportedly intervened in the market on a `` pretty big'' scale to prevent the dollar's further decline, said one dealer in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The bank refused to comment on its activities. But Japanese Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> called for joint action by monetary authorities to prop up the sagging dollar, a <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Wednesday's prices, included: 1.7190 West German marks, down from 1.7230; 1.4425 Swiss francs, down from 1.4465; 5.8745 French francs, down from 5.8975; 1.9399 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9575; 1,280.10 Italian lire, down from 1,291.00; and 1.2323 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2305 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8325, 1 cent more expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $ 1.8225, and the pound's highest level against the dollar since May 31. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for gold of $ 423.30 a troy ounce at midmorning today, unchanged from the opening bid, but down from $ 425.50 bid late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was also $ 423.30, down from $ 425.40 bid late Wednesday. Bullion dealers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said gold is languishing in narrow ranges despite the dollar's weakness, because the precious metal did n't have enough momentum to break through a strong resistance level at $ 426 on Wednesday. `` People just became frustrated and took some profits on long positions Wednesday, and there's not enough business in the European market today to warrant a good move in either direction,'' one dealer said. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid $ 424.34. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 6.32 a troy ounce, down from Wednesday's $ 6.39.

 The dollar plummeted to a 15-year low against the Japanese yen today, despite the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s reported intervention. But share prices rose on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 121.52 yen, down 2.02 yen from Wednesday's close of 123.54 yen Opening at 122.40 yen, the currency ranged between 121.30 and 122.40 yen. Today's close was the lowest since the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market began floating the exchange rate when the Bretton-Woods system was abandoned in February 1973. Before then, one dollar was fixed at 360 yen. The Bretton-Woods agreement at the end of World War II established the international currency exchange system in which the dollar's value was fixed at that of one ounce of gold, and all other currency rates were pegged to the dollar. Dealers attributed the dollar's dive today largely to investors' pessimism over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s ability to reduce its trade deficit and the central bank's failure to prop up the currency Market sources said the central bank bought dollars intermittently throughout the day but failed to reverse the currency's decline because it bought `` only a small amount of dollar compared to the amount -LRB- of -RRB- money in the market,'' said <PERSON> Mitsuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinugasa </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> does not comment on its activities. On Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the nation's September trade deficit was $ 10.5 billion, down from $ 12.27 billion in August `` But the dollar will keep falling as long as the market sentiment for the weaker dollar continues,'' said <PERSON> Sumio </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Sumitomo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the improved <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, `` it is still large, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not shown any signs to attempting to reduce its deficit further,'' <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON> said. A dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said neither central bank intervention nor dollar-buying by speculators could stop the currency's decline. `` There are still so many people who want to get rid of the currency,'' he said, adding he doubted if the dollar ever could return to the 122-yen level. He also spoke anonymously. Meanwhile, the 225-issue <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION>, which closed Wednesday at 28,996.12, added 80.69 points, or 0.28 percent, to close above the 29,000 level for the first time. Its finish at 29,076.81 was its fifth straight record high. Share prices opened lower in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> following declines in overseas markets and the dollar's plunge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, but gradually rose toward the end of trading as dealers became interested in a wide varieties of issues, said <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>' <PERSON> Yoshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Shimoyama </PERSON>. `` But many investors, especially speculative ones, were sitting on the sidelines to see what happens to the currency market,'' he said. In moderate trading with 850 shares traded on the first section, electrical issues attracted participants.

 <PERSON> WILLIAM </PERSON> <PERSON> BROCK </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative and former secretary of labor: In 1927, my grandfather sent a moving letter to all his employees and friends, warning that they should prepare for difficult times, save their money and avoid any debt. He talked about how the nation had gone on a binge of speculation, consuming to excess and borrowing to finance that consumption ... My grandfather was no more graced with the ability to forecast the future than I am, yet I know just how he felt in writing that letter. This nation is living beyond its means, borrowing long-term in order to satisfy short-term demands for immediate consumption, and imposing as a consequence, huge new obligations each week, each month, each year on our own children. Like some confused <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, we rob from those who have no voice or vote to satisfy our every whim.

<HEAD>`The Deficit Has Begun to Eat Away at the Foundations'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> ALAN </PERSON> <PERSON> GREENSPAN </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>: It is beguiling to contemplate the strong economy of recent years in the context of very large deficits and to conclude that the concerns about the adverse effects of the deficit have been misplaced. But this argument is fanciful. The deficit already has begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength. And the need to deal with it is becoming ever more urgent. To the extent that some of the negative effects of deficits have not as yet been felt, they have been merely postponed, not avoided. Moreover, the scope for further such avoidance is shrinking.

<TEXT>
 Day in and day out, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public is subjected to another newspaper column or television news story stating as if it were fact, that the federal budget deficit is so large and spending has been cut so much that no matter what the president-elect might say, taxes will have to go up, or the economy will founder. Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never succumbed to this herd psychology and neither did voters. Throughout the presidential campaign, the vice president spoke of a fair and flexible freeze to balance the budget without raising taxes. Many opinion leaders ridiculed this idea as void of substance and impractical. In fact, a fair and flexible freeze is imminently doable and goes right to the heart of the federal budget deficit problem. The deficit persists not because revenues are growing too slowly but because federal spending has been increasing much too rapidly.

 <PERSON> CHARLS </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> WALKER </PERSON>, chairman, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Formation </ORGANIZATION>, former deputy <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary: While spending restraint should be accorded first priority in deficit reduction, it is an inescapable fact that a swing of $ 180 billion per year in the federal budget is all but impossible without a significant tax increase. The only alternatives are either decimation of the defense budget, or sharp -LRB- and politically undoable -RRB- cuts in Social Security and <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. From a political standpoint, a workable approach might be a five-year budget plan that would split the deficit reduction task evenly between spending restraint and tax increases, or $ 90 billion per year for each. Spending goals would be met by slowing the rate of increase in federal spending relative to potential GNP -LRB- gross national product -RRB-. On the tax side, it is clear that new sources of revenue will have to be sought ... A broad-based consumption tax, such as a value added tax -LRB- VAT -RRB- has several advantages over other types of tax increases. It is a powerful revenue raiser, providing more than $ 10 billion per point per year if broadly applied. Surveys show that it is the `` least unpopular'' tax, the tax people prefer to pay if they must pay more.

 <PERSON> ALICE </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> RIVLIN </PERSON>, senior fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>: Solution to the deficit problem must be bipartisan, not only because the voters have elected a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> president and a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but because all the possible solutions are painful ones. Would that it were possible to cut some large item in the budget labeled, `` Waste, Fraud and Unnecessary Spending.'' Some such dollars doubtless exist, but they are buried in items that have strong support for good reasons. The budget can not be cut in sufficient amounts to eliminate the deficit, except by reducing programs and benefits that some people feel they want and need _ or by raising revenues. Hence, a strong bipartisan effort is needed to divide the pain, to explain why it is necessary and to build a national willingness to accept some short run hardships in the interest of a healthier economy in the longer run.

<HEAD>Rales Brothers Abandon Effort To Buy Interco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An investment group seeking to buy <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.7 billion has abandoned its tender offer after the St. Louis-based retailer and manufacturer failed to meet the group's deadline to begin takeover negotiations <ORGANIZATION> Cardinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Washington-based group controlled by <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rales </PERSON>, had said it would drop its $ 74-per-share cash offer at midnight Wednesday and return all tendered shares if <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> did not agree to give <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> confidential corporate information or enter into buyout talks. The Raleses' offer had attracted tenders for 92 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s 35.56 million outstanding shares. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price fell $ 1.87 -LCB- a share to $ 63.37 -LCB- in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading on Wednesday as traders anticipated an end to the Raleses' bid. An <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company would proceed with its plans for a $ 2.8 billion restructuring that was valued at $ 76 a share, including a $ 30.80, one-time cash and securities dividend to shareholders. However, the legal maneuvering resulting from the bid was not over. The <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to consider on Nov. 30 an appeal of a lower court ruling that declared <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s `` poison pill'' takeover defense illegal. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders also have filed suits against the company charging they were denied the full value of their stock by management's refusal to accept the Raleses' bid. A spokesman for the Raleses declined comment on their future plans. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today there were indications the brothers might increase their holdings in <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>. Lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> told the Journal they had been notified the Raleses were seeking federal clearance to acquire more shares in the company. The Raleses currently own 3.2 million _ or 8.7 percent _ of <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> has rebuffed the brothers' overtures since their initial $ 64-a-share offer in July. The restructuring plan, which would put <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> deeply into debt, would result in the sale of its <PERSON> Ethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> furniture division and other assets. Other <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> lines include <ORGANIZATION> Florsheim </ORGANIZATION> shoes, Converse sneakers and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Fog outerwear. <ORGANIZATION> Interco </ORGANIZATION> employs about 54,000 people nationwide and had sales of $ 3.34 billion last year.

 The stock market rallied today, attracting some buyers at its lowest level since late summer. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen nearly 89 points over the previous six sessions, rose 11.56 to 2,050.14 in the first half hour today. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 618 up, 370 down and 461 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 20.97 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said buying was encouraged by word that many central banks around the world were moving to support the dollar in foreign exchange. The dollar, which has fallen sharply in recent days, hovered early today near post-World War II lows against the Japanese yen. Brokers also said some traders were `` bargain hunting'' among stocks whose prices have fallen from their 1988 highs reached last month. However, they added, enthusiasm for stocks continued to be restrained by high yields available on short-term interest-bearing investments such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pernod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ricard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> apparently won Thursday a months-long takeover battle for <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s biggest whiskey maker, when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers said the bidder had not breached any takeover rules. That means <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON>'s offer of 285 million Irish punts, or 450 Irish pence a share, apparently prevails over <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s higher offer of 322 million punts, or 525 Irish pence a share. <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON>'s bid is the equivalent of $ 442 million. <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> shares fell 46 British pence to 378 pence on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following the announcement. <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> `` is obviously pleased that the ruling has gone its way and looks forward to completing the offer,'' said a <LOCATION> Pernod </LOCATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, adding that the French liquor company currently holds more than 53 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>' shares. The spokesman, who was not identified in accordance with British practice, said he was confident <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> would obtain clearance from the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, which is investigating the offer on competitive, public interest, regional employment and other grounds. The British takeover panel was ruling on whether <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> improperly obtained binding agreements from some <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>' shareholders <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> has previously said it would release shareholders from these commitments if the panel ruled against the French company. But the panel, in a lengthy statement, said <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> would n't be obliged to do so. Grand Met spokesman <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Halford </PERSON> said the British company had no intention of disposing of its 25.1 percent holding in <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're actively buying shares at the moment to reaffirm our interest in Irish Distillers,'' <PERSON> Halford </PERSON> said. Analysts said Grand Met's next move as a minority shareholder likely would be an attempt to negotiate the purchase of one of Irish Distillers' whiskey brands, or even a joint venture agreement with <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON>. Irish Distillers' brands include <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>'s and Paddy whiskeys. `` Grand Met have said all along that they were interested in an internationally known whiskey brand,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Littleboy </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Housing Construction Soared 7.2 Percent in October</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Housing construction soared 7.2 percent in October, the sharpest increase in eight months, with all regions of the nation posting gains except the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million units last month, up from a 1.45 million rate in September. The big gain followed a revised 0.8 percent decline in September and a 1.1 percent drop in August. Previously, the department said housing starts increased 1.5 percent in September and fell 3.1 percent in August. The October jump, the biggest since a 9.9 percent increase in February, suprised analysts who were expecting a decline of about 1 percent. `` Housing starts have been subject to a relatively large fluctuation in recent months,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, adding that the rebound last month `` puts the level of housing starts at 6.3 percent above the third quarter average. Starts in October still remain approximately 5 percent below last year's average. So, on the whole, it's good news.'' The housing start statistic is historically very volatile and early estimates are often sharply revised as the government collects more data. The increase last month can be explained, at least in part, by mortgage interest rates, which fell steadily from mid-August through early November, but have since started to creep higher. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said 30-year fixed rate mortgages averaged 10.24 percent last week, excluding special add-on fees known as points. That was down from a peak this year of 10.71 percent in August. Single-family homes in October were built at an annual rate of 1.15 million units, up 10.0 percent, following a 3.3 percent decline a month earlier. Apartment construction was up a scant 0.2 percent to 408,000 units in October after rising 6.3 percent in September. Building permits, a good indicator of future housing activity, shot up 7.4 percent in October to an annual rate of 1.50 million units, the highest since September 1987. Permits had fallen 4.8 percent a month earlier. By region, housing starts shot up 15 percent in the West to 498,000 units, rose 7.6 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to 268,000 units, climbed 4.6 percent in the South to 586,000 units and fell 2.4 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to 202,000. For the first 10 months of the year, housing starts were running 9.6 percent behind the same period of 1987. The peak year for housing construction during the current economic expansion was 1986, when 1.81 million units were started. Starts fell to 1.62 million last year, are expected to hit 1.45 million this year and decline further next year.

 <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been fending off a hostile takeover bid by a rival poultry producer, said today it agreed to be acquired by agriculture conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a stock-swap deal worth around $ 1 billion. The merger was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is now subject to stockholders' agreement. Under the definitive pact, each of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>'s 18.1 million common shares outstanding would be exchanged for between 1.875 shares and 2 shares of <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> shares, depending on market fluctuations, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, said in a brief interview. Based on <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s close of $ 28.87 -LCB- a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, the deal would be valued at around $ 1.04 billion. By late morning the stock had fallen to $ 28. <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> slipped 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 52.62 -LCB- in early trading. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> rejected as inadequate a hostile $ 940 million bid, or $ 52 a share, from rival <ORGANIZATION> Tyson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest poultry producer. <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>, Ark.-based <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has been trying since mid-October to take over <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, but directors of the Memphis-based company have spurned those advances. A secretary at <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>'s headquarters said no executvies were available for immediate comment. Executives of <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had met earlier this week, but there was no comment from either side on what was discussed. In a statement, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> deal `` provides our stockholders with significantly higher value than any other available alternative.'' `` Our stockholders will not only receive a significant premium for their stock but will continue to participate in <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>' future economic success as <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> stockholders,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said it expected to issue between 33.9 million and 36.2 million shares in the merger transaction. It currently has 80.1 million common shares outstanding. The company said it expected shareholders of both companies to vote on the agreement before the end of January. The terms of the agreement also gave <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> an option to purchase certain <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> assets. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Holly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay a fee and expenses if the merger was not completed under certain conditions. Two Holy Farms directors would join <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>'s board. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said the deal was `` an excellent strategic fit in terms of our businesses and our people.'' <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Farms </PERSON> is a diversified foods company with about half of its sales in chicken. The company had total sales of $ 1.6 billion last year. Tyson's 1987 sales totaled $ 1.8 billion. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> operates in many segments of the food industry.

<HEAD>Grain, Soybean Futures Open Lower On Slack Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in continued selling that analysts said was linked to disappointment over the slow pace of grain sales for export. Prices of grain and soybean futures have been in a downtrend since last Thursday, one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revised upward its 1988 production estimates for corn and soybeans. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report signaled that prices would have to drop to encourage more foreign buying, said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, assistant vice president of grain futures trading with <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It basically told anyone still friendly to the market: ` No way, buddy, at least not in the short term. Demand has got to get a lot larger.' `` I think people are just basically giving up on a lot of positions they've held for quite a while,'' she said. In early trading, wheat was 2 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.08 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.61 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.03 a bushel; soybeans were 4 \ cents to 6 cents lower with November at $ 7.39 a Livestock futures were lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> but pork-belly futures were mostly higher. Live cattle were .03 ent to .37 cent lower with December at 73.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .37 cent lower with November at 81.67 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent to .45 cent lower with December at 40.90 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .02 cent lower to .28 cent higher with February at 44.60 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Wednesday.

At the same time, a possible new bid may emerge from a group consisting of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking concern backed by the wealthy <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and billionaire investor <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Anschutz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Quoting unidentified sources, the newspaper said the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> had advanced a vague proposal that called for payment at least partly in securities instead of cash. No amount was disclosed and the proposal was given a dim chance of success, the Journal said. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> declined comment. First <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officials did not immediately return phone calls this morning. `` There are 20 different scenarios on how this could shape up,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> English </PERSON>, a food industry analyst with the investment firm of <LOCATION> Furman </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Selz </PERSON> after <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>'s announcement Wednesday. The takeover maneuvering was further complicated by a major lawsuit filed against <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management today in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a big holder of the company's bonds. The suit claims the buyout strategies pursued by management have devastated the value of those bonds because they raise the prospect of nearly quadrupling <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s debt. It was the second such court action filed in two days and reflected a growing rebellion of bondholders against debt-financed takeovers. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, another big holder of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> bonds, sued the company on grounds its portfolio has been hurt. RJR has declined comment on the suits. Before <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s special committee of outside directors implemented bidding procedures on Nov. 7, two offers had been made public _ a $ 20.3 billion, or $ 90-a-share, bid from the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and a $ 20.7 billion, or $ 92-a-share, offer by an investment group led by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s top managers. Although there are prospects that the two bidders could make a joint offer for the company, previous attempts to do so have broken down. And Wednesday's announcement came as a disappointment to investors, because `` that knocks out one of three that could have afforded something of this magnitude,'' Ms. English said. <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> had said any proposal it made would top the management and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> offers. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> stock dropped $ 4.50 a share to $ 84 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Wednesday. <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>'s announcement came three weeks after it held talks with the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management group and considered joining that bid for the company. It then assembled a rival group consisting of <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s president, <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who leads the managers trying to buy the company, has the backing of the investment firms <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> When the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> announced it would take sealed bids for the company, it also said it was considering the possible sale of the firm's food businesses in advance of any takeover. The proceeds of any sale would be paid to shareholders before any acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, the committee said. The food businesses accounted for about 60 percent of the company's $ 15.8 billion in 1987 net sales. Industry analysts have estimated the businesses would bring a sale price ranging from $ 12.5 billion to $ 15.5 billion. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> makes such well-known brands as Winston and Camel cigarettes, Oreo cookies and <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> vegetables. If any bidder succeeded in buying the entire company, it would be the biggest corporate acquisition ever. The <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> bids already dwarf the $ 13.4 billion spent in the 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by what is now <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a giant electronics company which became the target of a hostile takeover bid on Wednesday, reported Thursday its first-half earnings rose 6 percent, constrained by recent acquisitions of its own <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Siemens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> launched a joint 1.7 billion-pound, or $ 3.1 billion, bid Wednesday for <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION>, which `` emphatically rejected'' the offer Separately, in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> antitrust officials would look into the proposed merger between the three European electronics giants. A commission spokesman said the combination would be `` an operation of a European dimension'' and therefore of interest to the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> antitrust officials. Under the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> treaty, the commission is empowered to probe whether mergers satisfy competition rules. In its earnings statement, which made no mention of the bid, <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings for the six months ended Sept. 30 came to 47.3 million pounds, compared with 44.6 million pounds in the same period a year earlier. Revenue climbed 14.8 percent to 692.6 million pounds from 603.4 million pounds. The results were at the bottom end of a range of analysts' forecasts `` The important steps of the period under review give me encouragement to confirm my belief that we are back on the growth path,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>. `` I must emphasize, however, that much remains to be done in integrating our acquisitions,'' he said. `` A priority within the company is to accelerate the benefits of the acquisition program while at the same time reducing debt service cost.'' Recent <ORGANIZATION> Plessey </ORGANIZATION> acquisitions have included U.S.-based Electronic Systems Division, purchased from <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 310 million, and <ORGANIZATION> Hoskyns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a British computer services concern, bought for 164 million pounds.

 The stock market was mixed today in a session marked by some spotty buying of blue chips. The Dow Jones average of 30 big-name industrials, which had fallen nearly 89 points over the previous six sessions, rose 7.47 to 2,046.05 by noontime on Wall Street.

Analysts said buying was encouraged by word that many central banks around the world were moving to support the dollar in foreign exchange.

 Do regulatory and judicial limitations on insider trading include the activities of corporate officers who plot to take over the company for their own benefit rather than that of investors? Apparently not. The lack of attention to such activities suggests to some critics that corporate insiders may have found the best deal for themselves since at least the early 1930s and maybe since the turn of the century. Executives are the ultimate insiders. Not only do they have access to secrets _ sales expectations, new products, long-term prospects _ they have the power to do things with those secrets. In contrast, most of those recently prosecuted as insiders have been relatively passive, making money by investing and then waiting for others to put into motion the corporate changes that would make prices rise. Executive insiders have both the information and the means to make things happen, and those two factors are involved in almost every instance when they make a leveraged buyout offer to their own shareholders. The situation seems to be stirring more anger among bedazzled shareholders than among regulators, and that stirring _ in letters to newspapers, among investment groups, in shareholder conversations _ may erupt in legal action. Among questions commonly being discussed: _ Were corporate officers, managers paid by the shareholders, looking after their own or the shareholders' interests _ Did they maneuver the company's activities for their own or shareholder interest _ Were they direct in their communications with investors, employees and their own boards of directors _ who are committed by law to the shareholders' interests _ or did they purposely withold information on their intentions At the extreme is the question of whether managements have actively plotted to maintain corporate operations at a depressed level in order to obtain a low buyout price, knowing they could improve operations at a later date. Individual shareholders have been weak in dealing with such matters over the years, but in the past decade or so they have become better organized into effective forces. More significant, however, has been the growth of institutions, which now do most of the stock trading on organized exchanges and constitute enormous concentrations of funds for credit markets. Some of these institutions, such as pension funds and college endowments, have seen the value of their bond investments plumment after the management of companies in which they invested announced leveraged buyout plans. The demoralizing impact on bond prices generally has not received the same publicity afforded the run-up in stock prices. But the bond market impact has been severe; new debt needed to accomplish a leveraged buyout causes the value of existing bonds to decline, badly affecting the bond portfolios of investors. One such bondholder, <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, filed suit this week against <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, claiming <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> management failed to disclose it was considering a leveraged buyout when it sold <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> bonds to <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> last April. <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION> lost heavily. While some buyouts and unfriendly takeovers can have beneficial effects for the company, its shareholders, employees and community, a large percentage of them lead to fractured feelings, portfolios and even the companies themselves. While it might seem that laws and regulations on insider activities would apply, events suggest it is a no-man's land. It might take a series of these events, such as <ORGANIZATION> ITT </ORGANIZATION>'s suit, to clarify matters and provide rules and guidance where they seem not to exist.

 The battered dollar rebounded in early trading today, bolstered by a wave of coordinated dollar purchases by central banks, while the stock market struggled to its feet after a sharp drop on Wednesday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which has fallen nearly 89 points over the previous six sessions, was up 7.47 points at 2,046.05 at noon on Wall Street. The dollar was quoted at around 122.68 Japanese yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, up from 122.24 yen late Wednesday. That had been the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's lowest close against the yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading since modern exchange rates were established in the late 1940s. The government reported today that housing construction jumped 7.2 percent in October, the biggest increase in eight months. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million units last month, up from a 1.45 million rate in September. All regions of the nation, except the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, had posted gains, it said. The huge increase followed a revised 0.8 percent decline in September and a 1.1 percent drop in August. Previously, the department said housing starts increased 1.5 percent in September and fell 3.1 percent in August. The October jump was the biggest since a 9.9 percent increase in February. Analysts had been expecting a decline of about 1 percent. In another report Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit narrowed by 17 percent in September, to $ 10.5 billion. But the figures refused to calm jittery financial markets. The dollar plunged Wednesday, bond prices slid and the stock market tumbled to a 2 -LCB- - month low in response to the report, which indicated a smaller decline in the deficit than was expected by many market participants and analysts The dollar registered its lowest close against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading since modern exchange rates were established in the late 1940s, falling nearly 1 percent to 122.24 yen. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 38.59 points to 2,038.58, its lowest close since it stood at 2,002.31 on Sept. 1. Overall exports rose in September by $ 700 million to a record high $ 28.2 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. Imports declined by 2.5 percent or $ 1.1 billion to $ 38.7 billion from a record high in August. The $ 10.5 billion trade gap for September was down by $ 1.8 billion from the revised August trade deficit figure of $ 12.3 billion. But neither change was big enough to stem a new selling wave of dollars by traders who were worried about inflation from an overheating economy and skeptical of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise to reduce the federal budget deficit without any tax increases Many analysts had expected the trade deficit to drop below $ 10 billion in September, as it did in May and July. When it did not, `` more general concerns'' over the federal budget deficit and the willingness of foreigners to keep financing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consumer habits triggered Wednesday's selling spree on financial markets, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` Exports were up, imports were down. The reaction should have been positive,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. `` Although the trade deficit has improved, the improvement seems to have stalled out at about $ 11 billion -LRB- deficit -RRB- a month. Add to that figures on growth that we've seen in the past couple of weeks and the market has good reason to be pessimistic. In other economic developments Wednesday: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported that the operating rate at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities in October rose to the highest level in 8 -LCB- years _ The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said business inventories rose sharply relative to sales in September, a sign of economic weakness Analysts discounted the significance of the report, noting that sales have picked up since then. _ The value of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports jumped 26 percent to a four-year high of $ 35.2 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported

 The <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is changing advertising agencies for its flagship <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> brand, whose sales have been falling since the early part of the decade. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON>, senior vice president of marketing for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> would take over the advertising of High Life from <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, which has had the account since 1985. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> has been given an undisclosed new product assignment and will continue working on the <ORGANIZATION> Lowenbrau </ORGANIZATION> and Matilda Bay Cooler accounts, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> officials said. <PERSON> Schmid </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s advertising campaign featuring the slogan, `` Stop and Taste the High Life,'' has done a good job strengthening the product. `` It will now be <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>'s challenge to create advertising that builds strong sales momentum for the brand,'' he said. High Life's sales peaked in the early 1980s above 20 million barrels, but fell below 10 million last year. Beer Marketer's Insights, an industry newsletter, said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> spent $ 15.7 million on the advertising account for the first six months of this year. For all of 1987, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> spent $ 25.3 million on High Life, less than half the $ 67.7 million spent in 1986.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar ended slightly higher in hectic European trading Thursday, pushed up by reported intervention by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European central banks. Gold prices fell. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervened heavily during the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading day, but the intervention was largely shrugged off by the market, dealers said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> began to buy dollars for yen in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> morning, and the dollar-buying spree was quickly bolstered by the entry of the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, and then the British, Swiss, French, Italian, Austrian and other central banks, dealers said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>'s participation added a lot of weight to the round of intervention, since this is the first time the West German central bank has intervened in the dollar's latest downward move, dealers said. The intervention appeared to be moderate, but was spread widely among banks in order to have the biggest impact possible for the amount of money spent, they said. Dealers said they had expected concerted intervention to materialize, especially after so many warnings in recent days by top monetary officials, who either reiterated their desire for exchange rate stability, or said they were n't in favor of a lower dollar. But although the intervention was expected to keep the dollar steady for a while, dealers say they will soon be looking for a chance to sell dollars again. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.8227 to buy one pound, lower than late Wednesday's $ 1.8225. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday: 1.7298 West German marks, up from 1.7230; 1.4518 Swiss francs, up from 1.4465; 5.9075 French francs, up from 5.8975; 1.9560 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9575; 1,291.75 Italian lire, up from 1,291.00; and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2305. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell to 121.52 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 122.65 yen. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 422.00 a troy ounce, from $ 425.50 bid late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to close at a bid $ 421.00 an ounce, compared with $ 425.40 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid $ 424.34 an ounce. Silver bullion prices fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 6.29 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $ 6.39.

<HEAD>County Borrowing $100 Million From Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a unique 10-year deal, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> is borrowing $ 100 million from two Japanese lenders in what officials described as a first between a foreign nation and a local government entity. The county will borrow $ 100 million in yen under the arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Term </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` This is our first borrowing in a foreign market and the first state or local government borrowing of this nature,'' county Chief Administrative Officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Wednesday. `` We have been shopping for opportunities in the taxable market, and this is the first and best opportunity we have found,'' said <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. The county will invest the funds in `` high-grade debt securities'' and use the profits to help reduce the unfunded liability in the employees' retirement system, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said a currency swap agreement will also allow the county to repay the loan in dollars rather than yen as a hedge against any risks if the foreign currency fluctuates. Because of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, the county has been seeking alternatives to the domestic market. The law eliminated local government's ability to issue tax-exempt pension bonds. Additionally, interest rates are lower. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said the loan will be repaid in dollars at the 10-year <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> note rate, now 9.01 percent, plus .58 percent. At today's rates, these percentages are lower than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prime rate of 10 percent.

 The decision by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers to boost most of their lowest discount fares reflects current strength in passenger traffic, analysts say. Several major airlines said Wednesday and today that they were following <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s revamping of the popular fares, used by most vacation travelers. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest carrier, is matching <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s action throughout its route system, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornacker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. She said the average increase on the so-called MaxSavers to be hiked would be around $ 15 each way. Other airlines matching the MaxSaver changes through their entire systems include <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> partially followed the action, changing around 30,000 MaxSaver fares between different cities, said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Eagan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn </LOCATION> He said the Continental changes involve more than 100,000 such fares. `` We continue to review the others,'' <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. `` There is still indecision in the industry.'' Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> notified travel agents on Tuesday night and Wednesday that it would revamp its MaxSaver program to base fares on the length of a flight. Competition on individual routes, not mileage, had determined the fares in the past. Under the new formula, due to take effect next Wednesday, MaxSaver fares for longer flights generally would be raised while those for shorter hauls would mostly be reduced. The changes apparently raised about roughly two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s MaxSaver fares and cut the remaining MaxSavers. They followed by a few days plans initiated by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and matched by other big airlines to drop another category of discount air fares, the `` junk fares'' available four to seven days before a flight and used mainly by business travelers. Like Continental, most of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s fare changes were increases, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. He said <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> so far has only matched <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> in the markets where the two airlines compete directly. In other markets, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> will wait to see whether the other carriers follow <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s lead, <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> said. The hikes in both advance-purchase MaxSavers and last-minute junk fares reflect the recent trend toward higher air fares propelled by increasing passenger traffic. `` Consumers definitely are paying higher prices,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Geller </PERSON>, an airline analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Provident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Airline fares are up an average 8 percent from a year ago, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, which customarily has been a pacesetter in cutting fares, has started to enjoy stronger traffic _ allowing it to switch directions. The airline used to slash fares to attract more passengers, and its moves quickly were mimicked by the other big carriers in an effort to remain competitive. Now, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s improving traffic has made it a leader in fare hikes rather than cuts, at least for the moment. That has allowed <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> to switch its emphasis from filling seats with cheap fares to offering better service, said <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a spokesman for the airline. `` Service has the utmost attention at <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` After safety, the focus is on service.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> cited monthly statistics compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> showing recent improvements in <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s on-time performance and other aspects of its service. Continental may be `` trying to position itself in the price-service array'' by getting closer to full fares, suggested <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pincavage </PERSON>, who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. He said the big test of the airlines' strength will come in January and February, when passenger traffic is seasonally weak.

<HEAD>Soybeans Futures Plunge To 6-Month Low; Grains Follow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures plunged to their lowest prices in more than six months Thursday after cracking an important technical resistance point. The grain markets followed soybeans lower with corn futures also posting steep losses. Soybean prices had opened modestly lower in a continuation of the downward trend that had characterized the market since late last week. Analysts linked the early selling to heavy showers overnight in soybean-producing areas of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to the relatively slow pace of soybean sales for export. But analysts said selling accelerated as soybeans for delivery in November approached $ 7.40 a bushel, the low of the market's last significant bottom on July 28, and speculators pushed the price through that important barrier. At the close, wheat was 1 \ cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 4.09 a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 4 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.59 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 \ cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.03 a bushel; and soybeans were 17 \ cents to 25 \ cents lower with November at $

 The stock market was mixed today after an early rally faltered. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen nearly 89 points over the previous six sessions, rose 2.32 to 2,048.90 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.

 <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday its first-quarter earnings fell 26.9 percent from results a year ago which were swelled by a one-time accounting adjustment. The food company said excluding the accounting change, its results were up 11.1 percent compared with a year ago. Net earnings for the three months ended Oct. 30 fell to $ 69.4 million, or 54 cents per share, compared with $ 94.9 million, or 73 cents a share, a year ago. The 1987 results included an accounting change for income taxes that added $ 32.5 million, or 25 cents a share, to net income for the quarter. Without the change, the company would have reported a profit of $ 62.4 million, or 48 cents a share, in the first three months of 1987. Revenue for the quarter rose 13 percent to $ 1.33 billion from $ 1.18 billion a year earlier. The company said operating earninbgs rose 21 percent at <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION>, the Camden-based firm's largest division. It said its V8 vegetable juice had a 50 percent increase in volume, while Prego spaghetti sauce increased 27 percent and Franco-American pasta 12 percent. `` Increased soup marketing efforts to consumers are expected to increase per capita consumption this year, although first-quarter soup sales were flat because of promotional timing differences,'' <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said several acquisitions last year helped boost sales. <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>'s salad dressing sparked a 39 percent in the company's fresh product unit, while the volume of <ORGANIZATION> Vlasic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> increased by 36 percent.

<HEAD>Payment To Continental Angers Eastern Labor Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A union leader was angered to learn that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which must request rescheduling of $ 300 million in loans, has made multimillion-dollar payments to its non-union sister carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're talking about $ 50 million more that is being upstreamed, and yet they continue going out and telling the world this horror story about their financial problems,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> told a meeting of labor leaders Wednesday. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> is president of the Machinists local at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, the airline's largest union. Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are both subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest airline company. Eastern's latest quarterly filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> showed it paid <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> $ 17.5 million in September for frequent flier redemptions. It also paid $ 19 million to Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> for strike contingency services. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> also was critical of a $ 21.1 million loan from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harbour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a commuter carrier that is another <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. Eastern spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> called the $ 17.5 million frequent flier payment to <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> `` a perfectly legitimate transaction'' under the two airlines' joint frequent flier program, because more Eastern frequent fliers were redeeming their award certificates with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> than the other way around. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> announced recently that the strike contingency program is being discontinued because management does n't consider an Eastern strike likely. Eastern's Machinists and management have been in federal mediation over the union's contract since January. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> and other union leaders at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> say <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> has been bleeding away <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets since he took control two years ago. Eastern has paid <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> tens of millions of dollars in management fees, along with fees for use of the computerized reservations system that formerly belonged to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and is a separate <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> has urged <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to sell <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to an employee-backed group. Financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, the owner and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, recently expressed interest in buying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and met with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> and other Eastern unions. Eastern's <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> report also said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 16 million in expenses to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> left over from its 1986 takeover. Eastern, awaiting government approval of a $ 365 million sale of its northeastern shuttle to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, said it must make such asset sales to stay alive, unless it can reduce labor costs. Eastern has reported $ 233 million in net losses in the first three quarters of this year. Eastern officials plan to meet Friday with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> and West German lenders to renegotiate the airline's debt payments to avoid a technical default that could result in lenders demanding quicker payments of the loans. `` This situation has happened in the past,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON>. `` We do n't expect it to be a problem.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday that it is buying 16 turboprop aircraft from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> deHavilland Division for $ 180 million. The first of the 50-seat <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> deHavilland Dash 8-300 planes is scheduled to be delivered to the commuter airline next summer and the remainder in l990 and l991, Presidential said. Presidential Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Hap'' <PERSON> Pareti </PERSON> said the new aircraft will allow it to carry more passengers on some of Presidential's current flights, where it now flies a 19-seat aircraft, and allow it to open new markets The airline announced earlier this week a profit for the second consecutive quarter after losing $ 88 million since l985 when it began operating. Presidential's operations are concentrated through its hub at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> outside of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where it serves as a feeder for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which also has its major East Coast hub at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION>.

 Blue-chip stocks staged a modest rally Thursday, but the rest of the market remained in a slump. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had fallen nearly 89 points over the past six sessions, recovered 13.87 to 2,052.45. In contrast, declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 635 up, 844 down and 496 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 141.28 million shares, down from 161.71 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 164.67 million shares. Analysts said buying of blue chips was encouraged by word that central banks around the world were moving to support the dollar in foreign exchange. The dollar, which has fallen sharply in recent days, hovered early Thursday near post-World War II lows against the Japanese yen. Brokers also said some traders were `` bargain hunting'' among issues whose prices have fallen lately from their 1988 highs reached last month. However, they added, many market participants remained skeptical that the dollar was ready to launch a sustained turnaround. In addition, enthusiasm for stocks continued to be restrained by high yields available on short-term interest-bearing investments such as <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> led the active list and fell 1 \ to 82 -RCB- after trading as low as 79 The stock was buffeted by rumors and uneasiness about the prospective outcome of the bidding for control of the company. Gainers among the blue chips included <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 43 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 41 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION>, up -RRB- at 40 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 44 | Japanese stocks were strong as the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market hit new peaks. <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, which projected a 28 percent increase in consolidated net income for its current fiscal year, climbed 9 -RCB- to 195. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> gained 5 -RCB- to 157 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> 3 -LCB- to 51 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> Kyocera </ORGANIZATION> 4 -LCB- to 79 Elsewhere, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> rose ~ to 46 -RCB-. The company reported earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended Oct. 31 of $ 1.03 a share, up from 85 cents in the comparable period a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Veeco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION>, which agreed to be acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Unitech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for $ 26.50 a share, jumped 1 ~ to 24 -RCB- As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 3.60 billion, or 0.14 percent, in value.

<HEAD>Troubled Dollar Gets Slight Boost From Intervention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One of the most pronounced rounds of central bank intervention since spring helped stem the dollar's slide Thursday, but some analysts said the currency would need more help before it stabilizes. Gold prices dipped. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold bullion was bid at $ 419.75 an ounce at 4 p.m. EST, down from $ 423.60 late Wednesday. Traders said the central banks stepped into the foreign exchange markets in force to buy up dollars a day after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency had sunk to near historic lows. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell to 121.52 yen, nearly a 40-year low, despite heavy intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar moved to 122.65 yen, and then in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> it settled at 122.155 yen, off slightly from late Wednesday's 122.24 The dollar's lack of response against the yen was attributed to the frequency of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>'s recent intervention in the market. Buying by European central banks, which intensified through the day, was more unusual and helped the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency move higher against most other major currencies in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. The participation of the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> was particularly important since it was the first time <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank had intervened in the dollar's recent decline, traders noted. It was the most widespread intervention in the market since a big sell-off of dollars last April in reaction to a bad monthly trade report. Although the trade deficit showed modest improvement in the latest report issued Wednesday, the dollar sustained heavy losses nonetheless. Wednesday's slide convinced some traders that intervention by the central banks was inevitable. `` The market had been expecting it for some time,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, currency analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The question was when.'' <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> noted the timing of the intervention also coincided with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s auction of $ 9 billion in new 30-year bonds Thursday. Some analysts who follow the credit markets had feared that the dollar's recent weakness would scare foreign investors away from the auction. But analysts said more intervention would be necessary to stabilize the dollar. The market is also looking for clear policy statements from President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on what his administration will do to cut the trade and budget deficits. Worries about the twin deficits have kept pressure on the dollar since the election was decided last week. The dollar fell against the British pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where it cost $ 1.8227 to buy one pound, more than late Wednesday's $ 1.8225. But the pound fetched $ 1.82875 in late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading, less than $ 1.83375 late Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday were 1.7230 West German marks, up from 1.7164; 1.4470 Swiss francs, up from 1.4422; 1.23075 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2296; 5.8915 French francs, up from 5.8770; and 1,283.75 Italian lire, up from 1,277.75. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday: 1.7298 West German marks, up from 1.7230; 1.4518 Swiss francs, up from 1.4465; 5.9075 French francs, up from 5.8975; 1.9560 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9575; 1,291.75 Italian lire, up from 1,291.00; and 1.2335 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2305. Among precious metals prices on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold bullion for current delivery slipped to $ 420.10 an ounce, compared with $ 424.50 late Wednesday. Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 422.00 a troy ounce, from $ 425.50 bid late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold fell to $ 421.00 an ounce, compared with $ 425.40 bid late Wednesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 65 cents to $ 424.34 an ounce. Silver bullion for current delivery was quoted at the <ORGANIZATION> Comex </ORGANIZATION> at $ 6.170 an ounce, down from $ 6.277 late Wednesday. Silver prices fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 6.29 a troy ounce, compared with Wednesday's $ 6.39.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> oil ministers gathered Thursday to start a series of meetings considered crucial to capping the cartel's runaway production and bolstering world crude prices. But analysts and industry experts have expressed skepticism that the meetings would produce a substantive accord leading to immediate or long-lasting output restraints. Doubts grew when ministers adjourned after an hour saying they would hold separate talks on Friday and possibly reconvene again on Saturday. Eight ministers from <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s price and strategy committees were faced with the tough problem of designing a new production agreement that would allot quotas under a formula acceptable to all members. The committees' recommendations are to be presented to a full meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> Exporting Countries when oil ministers from all 13 nations gather on Monday. Indonesian Energy Minister <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON> <PERSON> Kartasasmita </PERSON> told reporters he was optimistic the ministers would succeed in their task. <PERSON> Ginandjar </PERSON>, who recently visited some of the other cartel countries, said, `` Everybody ... expressed their concern for the level of prices,'' which have hurt their economies. He said he was hopeful that `` all parties will do their best to reach a solution,'' adding: `` There is ground for negotiation and for eventual agreement.'' But he acknowledged the going would not be easy. `` We have to work very hard,'' he said. Industry experts, however, have said they doubt the meetings will produce results this time around. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> remains in disarray and the likelihood of market stability at reasonable oil price levels appears less promising today than it did a year ago,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, told a gathering of analyts and experts this week. <PERSON> Morrow </PERSON> said that even if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> reaches an agreement on new quotas, the industry is skeptical it `` will last for more than a few months _ if that long.'' Adding to the skepticism were reports this week that some senior <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> officials were already looking beyond the current talks to possible meetings next year to resolve the quota dispute between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which is considered the main stumbling block to an accord. A key problem facing the ministers is bringing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back into the quota system. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> set production ceilings based on a December 1986 arrangement limiting total output at about 15 million barrels a day. That excludes <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which has ignored its quota because it was not given parity with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, its foe in an eight-year war that ended with a cease-fire in August. Analysts say most of the cartel members have exceeded their quotas in recent months, adding to the glut in the world market. Prices have fallen to $ 4 or more below the cartel's benchmark price of $ 18 per 42-gallon barrel. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> estimated in its Monthly Oil Market Report that the cartel's production jumped to almost 21.1 million barrels a day in October, the highest monthly output in more than five years. Analysts differ on the amount that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would have to reduce its output to eliminate the excess and boost oil prices, with opinions ranging from 2 million to 4 million barrels a day. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, in refusing its quota of 1.5 million barrels a day, said it wanted to have the same ceiling of 2.4 million barrels as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Since the cease-fire went into effect, negotiations have been under way to bring <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back into the quota system. Iraqi Oil Minister <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Raheem </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Chalabi </PERSON> told reporters before the closed-door meeting began Thursday: `` It's very clear our position has n't changed.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had proposed that its quota reflect a higher domestic demand of some 1 million barrels a day. Iraqi internal demand is estimated at 300,000 barrels a day, the source said. Analysts estimate <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has been producing at least 2.6 million barrels a day, an amount that could hit 3.7 million barrels next year with completion of a new pipeline through <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> to the Red Sea.

 Northwestern University's J.L. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> has the country's best MBA program, beating out such powerhouses as <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Wharton </LOCATION>, Business Week magazine said in a survey released Thursday. The survey, which appears in the Nov. 28 issue of the news weekly, also said that among other surprises, the graduate business schools of <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dartmouth </ORGANIZATION> made its top five, while <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, usually near the top of other rankings, finished lower. Business Week said its survey was based on random polling of about 3,000 1988 graduates of 23 schools that often comprise conventional top-20 lists, which usually put <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wharton </PERSON> first. The magazine said it received 1,245 replies to a 35-item questionnaire, about 42 percent of those sampled and about 15 percent of all full-time MBA graduates of those schools in 1988. It said questions concerned quality of teaching, curriculum, environment and job-placement efforts on a scale of 1 to 10. A separate poll of corporate recruiters also was factored into the rankings, the magazine said. Northwestern's <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, emerged as the favorite of corporate recruiters and garnered some of the highest grades from graduates, earning it the No. 1 spot.

<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in the week ended Nov. 7, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,046.2 billion in the week ended Nov. 7 from $ 3,039.5 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, increased to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,878.1 billion from $ 3,870.0 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 781.6 billion from a revised $ 784.6 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $ 782.9 billion, a 2.9 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in mid-1988 that it reaffirmed its target for annual growth in M2 and M3 at between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a specific target range for M1 since early 1987. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks fell $ 59 million, compared with a gain of $ 1.18 billion a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window averaged $ 540 million, up from $ 251 million a week earlier _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 284.4 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 283.5 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>Soybean Market Collapses To 6-Month Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices plunged to their lowest levels in more than six months Thursday after cracking an important resistance point. On other markets, grain, cotton, precious metals, energy, livestock, meat and stock-index futures all were lower while copper futures advanced. Soybeans for delivery in November settled at $ 7.19 -LCB- a bushel on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, a loss of 25 -RCB- cents from Wednesday's final price It was the lowest settlement price for a near-month soybean contract since May 13, when the May contract finished at $ 7.19 -LCB-. Soybean prices had opened modestly lower in a continuation of the downward trend that has characterized the market since late last week. Analysts linked the early selling to heavy showers overnight in soybean-producing areas of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to the relatively slow pace of soybean sales for export. But selling accelerated as November soybeans approached $ 7.40 a bushel, a price not seen since July 28, and speculators pushed the price through that important barrier. `` When you hit that level, you started seeing a lot of liquidation in the market,'' said <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leow </PERSON>, an assistant vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Thomson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McKinnon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.09 \ a bushel; corn was 3 \ cents to 5 cents lower with December at $ 2.59 \ a bushel; oats were -RCB- cents to 1 \ cents lower with December at $ 2.04 a bushel; and soybeans were 17 -RCB- cents to 25 -RCB- cents lower with November at $ 7.19 Cotton futures finished sharply lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a technically inspired sell-off. Analyst <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the cotton market was due for a correction. `` The fundamentals have been bearish for a long time,'' he said. `` We've got large crops throughout the world and we have a slower offtake -LRB- from existing stocks -RRB- than we had last season. In spite of that, the market has gone up and stayed up. Now it's finally coming down,'' he said. Cotton settled 1.5 cents to 1.75 cents lower with December at 53.20 cents a pound. Copper futures rebounded strongly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after falling for four of the five previous sessions. Analysts attributed the rise to renewed supply concerns prompted by reports of production problems at a state-owned mine in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> and the terrorist bombing of the <ORGANIZATION> Peruvian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Owners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> offices in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. Copper settled 1.5 cents to 5.3 cents higher with December at $ 1.333 a pound. Silver futures prices fell sharply for the third straight day on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market adjusted to recent losses in the gold market and to its own bearish fundamentals, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Silver settled 11 cents to 11.8 cents lower with December at $ 6.19 a troy ounce; gold was $ 4 to $ 4.50 lower with December at $ 421.10 a troy ounce. Energy futures weakened substantially on growing pessimism about <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to reach an agreement to limit crude-oil output and force prices higher, analysts said. Oil ministers of the 13 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> gathered Thursday in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> to start a series of meetings on capping their runaway production. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 38 cents to 91 cents lower with December at $ 13.29 a barrel; heating oil was 1.50 cents to 1.86 cents lower with December at 42.97 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .85 cent to 1.99 cents lower with December at 45.65 cents a gallon. Cattle futures fell sharply late in the session on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, pressured by aggressive speculative selling on bearish technical signals, analysts said. Expectations of a seasonal decline in demand for beef also contributed to the sell-off. A surge of last-minute selling drove hog futures to a sharply lower close while weakening cash markets weighed on both the hogs and the pork bellies, analysts said. Live cattle settled .50 cent to 1.17 cents lower with December at 72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .02 cent to .75 cent lower with November at 81.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .38 cent to 1.10 cents lower with December at 40.70 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .78 cent to .90 cent lower with February at 43.65 cents a pound. Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Merc </LOCATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled .40 point lower at 264.65.

 <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it is launching a major campaign to claim a piece of the $ 2 billion-a-year market in long-distance calls from pay telephones. The marketing drive is an effort to capitalize on a recent federal court ruling that ordered the local <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> operating companies to stop discriminating in favor of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on collect, third-party and coin-paid long-distance calls placed from public phones and calls charged to <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> company credit cards.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its major economic allies successfully intervened Thursday to halt a slide in the value of the dollar, but economists predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will be forced to boost <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates in a further defense of the beleaguered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> greenback. The coordinated intervention in the currency markets by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was the most widespread dollar rescue effort since last April when the markets were stampeded into a dollar sell-off following a bad monthly trade report. Despite the success of Thursday's rescue effort, many traders foresaw renewed selling pressure in the months ahead because of fears that President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will be unable to reach agreement on ways to trim the budget deficit. Investors are concerned that the enlarged Democratic majorities in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s tough no-tax stance guarantee further budgetary gridlock. For this reason, many economists predicted the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will be forced in coming weeks to begin pushing interest rates higher in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Some analysts said they would not rule out an increase in the discount rate, the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges to make loans to member banks. A boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can send of its intention of driving interest rates higher. Higher interest rates make dollar-denominated investments more attractive to foreigners and help relieve the pressure to sell off such assets. Higher interest rates also dampen inflationary pressures brought on by a weaker currency. Intervention is the process by which the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> or other countries' central banks buy and sell currencies in an attempt to influence the market price. The intervention Thursday was begun by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, which started buying dollars after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency fell to near 40-year lows in trading in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. After the initial purchases by the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, currency traders reported that the central banks of the major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bought dollars, followed by buying by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> central bank. The concerted dollar-buying helped to push the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency up to 122.155 yen at the close of trading in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, off slightly from Wednesday's close of 123.54 yen. It had closed at 121.52 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, after having dropped as low as 121.30 during the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading day. But traders said they doubted the joint intervention effort would have more than a temporary restaining effect on the downward pressure on the dollar. `` This will only provide temporary relief,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hand </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` The market wants to see some concrete kind of plan on how the budget deficit is going to be solved.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hormats </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>, predicted that the currency markets and the stock and bond markets would continue to be in turmoil between now and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration on Jan. 20. `` I think the market has confidence in the economic team <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is putting together, but the market is impatient because the budget and trade imbalances are so big,'' he said. Market unrest already has prompted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who will stay on in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, to issue reassuring statements that the new administration considers cutting the budget deficit to be a top priority. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> added the strongest voice yet to calls for urgent action on the deficit, telling the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that the deficit, which climbed to $ 155.1 billion in the last fiscal year, `` already has begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength.'' However, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, asked about <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>'s warning, said, `` Economists never agree on anything For every economist you cite we can trot out one who is diametrically in opposition.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>'s remarks on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' surprising, given the need for the new administration to present a united front with the central bank to reassure jittery markets. `` The market right now is looking for some reassurance that something is going to be done about the federal budget deficit and about the trade deficit,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. `` They are afraid that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is more willing to solve the deficit by letting the dollar fall than by cutting the budget deficit.'' While a weaker dollar makes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods less expensive on overseas markets and imports more expensive for Americans, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has insisted that he does not plan to abandon the two-year <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> effort to stabilize the dollar's value. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said that with the uncertainty in currency markets, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> soon will start pushing interest rates higher. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will have to let interest rates edge upward,'' he said, predicting that tighter monetary policy could trigger an increase in banks' prime lending rate by next month. <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramley </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board and now chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the central bank was likely to make behind-the-scenes moves to nudge rates higher in coming weeks but would wait until January for something as dramatic as a boost in the discount rate, unless the dollar threatened to tumble into a free-fall. `` They would like to wait before tightening further, but the exchange markets may force the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s hand,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices fell Thursday, pressured by the weaker dollar and growing concerns about inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond declined 21-32 point, or about $ 6.50 for every $ 1,000 of face value. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price and is a key indicator of interest rate trends, rose to 9.17 percent from 9.11 percent late Wednesday. Analysts said bond prices continued to weaken in the face of a declining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. `` The bond market took its cue from the dollar,'' said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kellner </PERSON>, chief economist at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Also contributing to weaker bond prices was a government report that housing construction in October posted the biggest increase in eight months The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new construction rose 7.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.55 million units from its September level. Both a weaker dollar and stronger housing statistics suggest stronger inflationary pressures. Inflation erodes the value of bonds. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 9 billion in 30-year bonds at an average yield of 9.10 percent, down from 9.17 percent at the last 30-year auction on May 12. It was the lowest rate since 30-year bonds averaged 8.51 percent at the Feb. 4 auction. The 30-year bond auction was postponed for a week because the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> previously had sold nearly as many of the bonds as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had authorized. But, tax legislation signed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Nov. 11 lifted the limits, paving the way for Thursday's auction. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term government issues were 3-32 to 7-32 point lower, intermediate maturities slipped between \ point and 15-32 point and 20-year issues lost | point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, declined 3.47 to 1,134.25. Corporate bonds fell. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, had edged down 0.64 to 293.60. Municipal bonds held steady. The Bond Buyers Municipal Bond Index, which measures the prices on 40 long-term bonds, was unchanged Thursday from Wednesday's late level. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, rose to 8.18 percent as the discount increased 2 basis points to 7.92 percent. Yields on six-month bills advanced to 8.40 percent as the discount rose 1 basis point to 7.96 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.55 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.96 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 \ percent, up from 8 percent late Wednesday

 There were 28 mergers and acquisitions worth $ 1 billion or more through the first three quarters of the year, indicating 1988 will see a record number of such `` megadeals,'' according figures released Thursday by <ORGANIZATION> Mergers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Acquisitions magazine. The annual record of 31 deals of $ 1 billion or more was set in 1986, the magazine stated. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikora </PERSON>, editor of the Philadelphia-based bimonthly journal, said the increasing number and magnitude of the deals makes it likely they also will beat the annual dollar record of $ 206.4 billion set two years ago. The $ 6.5 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Campeau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was the largest deal completed so far this year. But with such transactions as the $ 13.1 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and the proposed sale of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for more than $ 20 billion in the works, the Campeau-Federated deal may not be the largest completed by year's In the third quarter of this year, M & amp; A recorded 791 completed mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. The worth of the 402 deals with reported prices totaled $ 44 billion. Last year during the same period, M & amp; A recorded 904 completions with a value of $ 47 billion. In the second quarter this year, 775 transactions were recorded with a value of $ 55.4 billion. For the first nine months of this year, completed deals totaled 2,493, with a value of $ 137.8 billion for 1,225 transactions revealing price. For the same span of 1987, there were 2,797 transactions and a recorded value of $ 125.8 billion. `` One reason for the reduction in the number of transactions is that the market is extremely competitive with attractive businesses drawing multiple bids,'' <PERSON> Sikora </PERSON> said. `` This condition has driven up prices, forcing some buyers temporarily to the sidelines and also has consumed time that active buyers may have devoted to more acquisitions,'' he said. `` However, acquisition interest among all potential buyers remains strong, and the growth in megadeals points up the abundance of financing available to acquirers,'' he said. Foreign acquisitions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled 91 with a value of $ 12 billion in the third quarter against 95 worth $ 11.9 billion in the second quarter and 84 worth $ 12.8 billion in the third quarter of 1987. The leveraged buyout market posted 65 third-quarter completions with known value of $ 7.6 billion against 61 with a $ 15.7 billion value in the second quarter. Leveraged buyouts totaled 62 with a $ 9.7 billion value in the third quarter of 1987.
