 A <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> plane crashed into the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> during a training flight Sunday afternoon, killing the pilot and three teen-age cadets, authorities said. The single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 182 was reported down shortly before 2:00 p.m. three miles off the southernmost point of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, which is across <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ciega </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION>. `` We sent a cutter and a helicopter out to the scene and all they found was debris on the surface of the water,'' said Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> station. `` Divers later found the wreckage in about 25 feet of water with the bodies of four people inside.'' The plane had taken off from a small <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> airport. The cause of the crash was not known. A second small plane crash Sunday near <LOCATION> Mound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, killed a St. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, couple and their 16-year-old granddaughter, authorities said. The single-engine <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON> crashed into a field 5 -LCB- miles north of <LOCATION> Mound </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at about 1 p.m., said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, a dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>. The victims were identified as <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>, 66, who was the pilot; his wife, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Worley </PERSON>, 57, and their granddaughter, <PERSON> Angela </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Procella </PERSON>, 16, of <LOCATION> Kirbyville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> crash, a 46-year-old pilot was at the controls, and three cadets aged 14 to 18 came along on the training flight, said Cmdr. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sportell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> squadron. `` This was what is known as a <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> cadet orientation,'' Sportell. `` These young people were n't familiar with flying and this was just to give them a chance to get up in the air with a senior pilot. They were not flying the plane.'' The civilian organization, which helps search for downed aircraft, often enlists young people interested in aviation careers. The dead were identified as pilot <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> McNight </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shawn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, 18, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Flythe </PERSON>, 17, and <PERSON> Damion </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, 14, all of the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Petersburg </LOCATION> area, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Some 35,000 Midwestern telephone workers walked out Sunday, joining 150,000 <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> employees on strike in the East and West. But two of the seven regional telephone companies reached a settlement with their workers Sunday, averting a walkout by 83,000 employees. Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> struck <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, which serves 12.3 million customers in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, after a midnight CDT deadline passed. The strikers at <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> joined fellow <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> members and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members at three other `` Baby Bells'' _ <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> _ who walked out a week earlier. But the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, based in the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area, extended talks after a midnight MDT strike deadline and reached a settlement nine hours later, keeping 42,000 workers on the job. In <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, negotiators with <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its union reached a tentative agreement at about 7:15 p.m. Sunday, averting a strike by some 41,000 telephone workers in five states. `` We're pleased with it,'' said <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for District 6 of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're very pleased that we were able to avert a strike, especially.'' Union spokesman <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> <PERSON> Wooldridge </PERSON> said the company had agreed to a 5.25 percent increase in base wages for the first year, plus a $ 1,000 bonus, and a 2.25 percent increase in the second and third years, as well as an increase in cost-of-living allowances. The company also dropped its attempt to make employees pay a portion of health insurance premiums for dependents, <PERSON> Wooldridge </PERSON> said, but there were some increases in certain health care costs. <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> confirmed that the two sides had reached an agreement, but released no details. The company has 11 million customers in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The strike had been put on hold as negotiators continued talking past the midnight Saturday deadline. The bargainers broke off the talks at 6 a.m. and resumed Sunday evening. The regional companies already on strike have said that most direct-dial calls were going through normally on automated equipment. Some union jobs were filled by management employees, but the walkouts disrupted installations and repairs, operator-assisted calls and inquiries to directory assistance. The chief issues in most of the talks have been wages and efforts by several companies to get workers to pay part of their health insurance costs. At U S West, spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said bargainers would continue working to `` resolve details and complete other formalities.'' Union spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> said he expected the document to be completed in a few days and brought to a vote by members within weeks. <PERSON> Frazee </PERSON> said the new pact `` retained basically the same health-care program'' and provides a 5 percent immediate raise, plus smaller wage increases in the second and third years, a $ 600 bonus and a wage increase based on productivity. The company would not immediately release details of the contract. <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maulis </PERSON> said union members at U S West were `` proud to have negotiated an agreement that secures a fair share of the company's outstanding profits for the workers who made their financial success possible.'' US West services 11.8 million customers in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> has 35,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers on strike, said company spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>'s 18,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> settled previously with the company's subsidiaries, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. Strikes by <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> members began a week ago at New York-based <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, which serves <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>; Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, which serves <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>; and San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION>, which serves northern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. No formal talks were scheduled in those strikes over the weekend, but <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> and union representatives met for about an hour informally Sunday. One of the Baby Bells settled Aug. 5 with all its workers _ Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, which serves nine Southeastern states. The Baby Bell companies were created in 1984 by the breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>. Scattered instances of vandalism have been reported. During the weekend, a telephone cable was cut with a hacksaw in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, disrupting service to about 600 customers in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf `The new...' with 1 graf to add dropped word `attempt.'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has ordered that this year's college graduates must work for one or two years before pursuing graduate studies, an official report said Saturday The new rules appeared to be another attempt to prevent a recurrence of this spring's popular, pro-democracy student movement that was crushed by troops on June 3-4. About 3,500 students planned to start master's and doctoral degree programs this fall, the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. But a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> circular said students, especially those in the social sciences, must first gain work experience. The new order does not affect students who already have work experience, the paper said. The government already has cut the number of incoming college freshmen nationwide by 30,000 to 610,000 students in an apparent effort to curb student unrest. The paper quoted an unnamed education commission official as saying the new regulation was part of the government's efforts to reform university enrollment and job assignment systems. He said the new order would significantly improve the backgrounds of people in the fields of applied and social sciences. The report said more than half of this year's new graduate students worked before continuing their studies.

<HEAD>Report: Iran Tried to Buy Toxins</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has tried to buy poison-producing strains of fungus from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The disclosure that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was seeking the toxins renewed concerns that the country is trying to develop a weapon from the substances, Western intelligence officials said in Sunday editions of the Times. American officials said the efforts could be part of a research program to develop a defense against biological weapons. But, an American official, speaking about the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's decision to urge the Canadians and Dutch to block the sale, said: `` There are enough bad vibes that we want to stand in the way of it We're bending over backwards to be careful.'' The Iranians were seeking to buy types of fungus found on wheat and grass that produce toxins called mycotoxins which can harm humans and animals by inhibiting the ability of cells to synthesize proteins, the newspaper said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1982 asserted that mycotoxins were used in a weapon that sprayed `` yellow rain'' on the Hmong tribespeople in <LOCATION> Laos </LOCATION> by communist forces. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> began trying to buy the fungus last December when a man identified in intelligence files only as Mr. <PERSON> Moallem </PERSON> got in touch with Dr. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiefer </PERSON>, director of the toxicology research center at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saskatchewan </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schiefer </PERSON> thought it unusual because the purchase of such fungus is usually from one of many laboratories around the world and not from one scientist to another, the paper said. So <PERSON> Schiefer </PERSON> contacted the Canadian government and he subsequently declined to sell them the fungus. Soon after that, the <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> tried to buy 11 types of fungus from the Fungus Cultures in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, the paper said. The Dutch rejected the offer.

 The Rolling Stones launched their 1989 tour Saturday night when they pulled into a tiny <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> nighclub for a tuneup that thrilled 700 fans who paid $ 3 apiece for the impromptu gig. `` Welcome to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> shouted as the band took the stage at <ORGANIZATION> Toad </ORGANIZATION>'s Place. `` This is our debut show of the 1989 tour.'' The Stones, who have been rehearsing for the last six weeks in the tiny northwest <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, brought the house down with an 11-song, hour-long set. The tour is the Stones' first in eight years. The band opened the set with `` Start Me Up,'' and played several songs from their new album, `` Steel Wheels,'' which is to be released Aug. 29. The show featured the classic songs that have made the Stones one of rock's most enduring bands including, `` Jumpin' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flash </PERSON>,'' `` Honky Tonk Woman,'' `` <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugar </PERSON>,'' and `` It's Only Rock' n' Roll.'' <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>, who wore a T-shirt promoting the 1989 North American tour underneath a blue shirt, traded licks on the guitar on several songs with Stones guitarists <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. The Stones have traditionally tried to opened new tours with impromptu shows at small venues. Word that the Stones were going to play at <ORGANIZATION> Toad </ORGANIZATION>'s leaked out over the last several days, said <PERSON> Storm </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON>, music director at WEBE-FM in <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>. Fans lined up outside the club and hundreds were turned away before the Stones took the stage at 10:45 p.m. Saturday.

 Republican Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> will meet Democrat <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Geren </PERSON> in a runoff for a congressional replacement for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker toppled by ethics charges, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth-area </LOCATION> voters decided Saturday. <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, host of the nationally syndicated TV health show `` 60 Second Housecall,'' garnered 21,978 ballots, or 39 percent of the vote, to 17,751 votes, or 32 percent, for <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> lawyer and former aide to Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. That made a runoff necessary, since one candidate had to garner more than 50 percent of the vote to win. Democrat <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> came in third with 12,308 votes, or 22 percent. The remaining five candidates _ two Democrats, two Republicans and a Libertarian _ trailed far behind. The highest vote-getter of the five was Republican <PERSON> Laraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bethke </PERSON>, who had 1,313 votes, or 2.4 percent. <PERSON> Geren </PERSON> immediately predicted a runoff victory, pointing out that Saturday's combined Democratic vote topped the total achieved by Republican candidates. `` Well, the Democrats won tonight,'' <PERSON> Geren </PERSON> said at a victory party in west <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. `` It took us four candidates to do it, but when you total it up, we got nearly 60 percent of the vote. I call that a victory.'' Shortly after the results came in, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> endorsed <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>. `` He's a good man I think he will be a good congressman,'' said the former congressman, who had not endorsed anyone running in the special election. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said he also would lend his support to <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> said he was n't surprised <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had come out for <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>, and said it was `` a formidable endorsement.'' But <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> predicted he, too, would win the runoff. Under state law, candidates from both parties run in a single special election, with a runoff between the two top vote-getters if no one gets a majority. The law requires the governor to schedule the runoff 20 to 30 days after the votes are officially counted, which usually occurs within a week of the election. In an emotionally charged referendum in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, voters approved 2-to-1 a proposal to reorganize the city council to equalize voting power between whites and minorities. The proposal received 41,456 votes to 20,823 against. Voters in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Coppell </PERSON> faced suspension of bus service at midnight Sunday after voting to withdraw from the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. The suburbs of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rowlett </LOCATION> decided to keep the service. At the American Legion post where <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, cast ballots earlier Saturday, a steady stream of voters turned out during an overcast, 80-degree morning. Turnout had been expected to play a large part in the election because few issues divided the candidates, and many residents remained angry that they had to vote for anyone other than the popular <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. In the congressional race, <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Geren </PERSON> had been the front-runners in a recent opinion poll. Each man had his party's endorsements, but <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, who stressed a pro-choice stand on abortion, had endorsements from labor groups and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s son. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not endorse anyone. Also on the ballot were Democrats <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, Republicans <PERSON> Bethke </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, and Libertarian <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckingham </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. After the 1988 election, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressional delegation had 20 Democrats and nine Republicans The Democrats had a 34-year lock on the 12th District under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who was revered for his talents at serving constituents and bringing federal money and jobs to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, resigned his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat June 30 after an ethics investigation turned up 69 instances of alleged rules violations. Democrats went into the election controlling the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by an 80-seat margin, but faced embarrassment if they lost in a district where registered Democrats predominate. In special elections earlier this year, Democrats held a seat in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and won one in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, and Republicans held a seat in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, the 10-4-1 proposal called for expanding the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> from 11 members to 15, with 10 elected from single-member districts, four elected from overlapping `` super districts'' and the mayor elected citywide. Currently, eight members of council are elected from single-member districts and three _ including the mayor _ are elected at large. Proponents said the plan would give minorities a greater voice in city government. Opponents said it would dilute minority voting power. Others said the plan would n't substantially change the ethnic makeup of council districts. The transit referendum on whether five <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburbs would withdraw from <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> bus service could affect the long-range fate of a $ 2.45 billion plan to crisscross the metropolitan area with 66 miles of light rail by 2010. The plan also called for 18 miles of rail connecting downtown to the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and 37 miles of bus and car pool lanes for suburban commuters. Opponents said the plan would cost the suburbs a lot more than the bus service would be worth.

 Telephone workers in five Midwestern states went on strike early Sunday, but negotiations between unions and regional telephone companies serving 19 other states continued past midnight deadlines in an effort to avert walkouts. Week-old strikes continued to disrupt service in another 15 states. Strikes began at 12:01 a.m. local time Sunday against <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, all subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Belkin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said early Sunday that progress had been made in negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and U S West. Talks continued past midnight deadlines. `` We've passed the deadline,'' <PERSON> Belkin </PERSON> said just minutes past midnight Sunday. `` Reports from the negotiating table are that there is progress being made. There has been a call for an extension of the contract. However, we understand large numbers of workers are walking out of buildings and not abiding by the extension.'' U S West spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said, `` What we've heard is that they've stopped the clock ... and they're going to continue bargaining. Obviously, the assumption is that they must be close or else they probably would n't continue to bargain.'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> negotiations, company spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the company gave the union a new proposal about 15 minutes before the strike deadline, which had 41,000 union employees in five states poised to walk out. `` I think we're still hopeful we can get a contract,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. He said the issues still on the table dealt with wages and health benefits. But negotiations with the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, which serves 12.3 million customers and has nearly 40,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers, collapsed late Saturday. `` We were unable to reach a fair agreement with the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- companies,'' <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. `` We are prepared to continue to negotiate, but at this point we are on strike.'' The three so-called `` Baby Bells'' met with or exchanged proposals and counterproposals Saturday with representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>. The unions set a midnight deadline for walkouts, local time. Strikes by the two unions against three other regional telephone companies _ <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> _ began last weekend. A seventh Baby Bell, Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, was the only one to reach a tentative settlement last weekend. The Baby Bell companies were created by the 1984 breakup of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION>, which was not directly affected by this month's walkouts. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T settled with the two communications unions earlier this year. Officials at the regional companies already on strike said last week that most direct-dial calls were going through normally on automated equipment, but the walkouts disrupted repair services, operator-assisted calls, and inquiries to directory assistance. Those strikes affected 15 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said the key issues dividing the unions and the phone companies were wage increases and management efforts to make workers help pay health insurance costs. Various local issues are also being discussed. In some cases, the talks involve <ORGANIZATION> Baby </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> subsidiaries as well as the main regional companies. Companies made strike preparations, including briefing management employees on filling union jobs. U S <PERSON> West </PERSON> said it planned to pull its advertising from various media outlets Monday if there is a strike, in order to reduce demand for services. `` Normally, we advertise to stimulate business,'' said U S West spokeswoman <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` If we get in a strike situation, we would not want to overload our business offices.'' The regional companies that faced Saturday strike deadlines were: _ <LOCATION> U </LOCATION> <LOCATION> S </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, serving 11.8 million lines in 14 states: <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. It has 42,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers and 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> workers, according to <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>. _ <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, serving 11 million customers in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. It has 44,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>, no <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> workers. _ <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, serving 12.3 million customers in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. It has 39,500 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers, who are continuing talks, and 18,000 <ORGANIZATION> IBEW </ORGANIZATION> workers, most of whom have reached a separate settlement with one <ORGANIZATION> Ameritech </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. Walkouts continued at San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telesis </ORGANIZATION>, which provides service in northern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and all of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; Philadelphia-based <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, which serves <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>; and New York-based <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION>, which serves all or parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. No formal talks were held Saturday in those walkouts. However, informal talks were held in the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> strike, and <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> officials told the compnay they were prepared to bargain around the clock, <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON> said. The one Baby Bell that settled, Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, provides service in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. A contract with its 64,000 <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> workers late Aug. 5 averted a walkout.

 Lightning forced the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> early Sunday to postpone the launch of a military navigation satellite for the fourth time in a week. As rain fell on the launch pad and lightning crackled nearby, the countdown on the Delta rocket continued down to the 4-minute mark and was held there as officials hoped for a break in the weather. The launch team had only a 21-minute period starting at 2:11 a.m. in which to place the Navstar satellite into a desired 11,000-mile-high orbit. When the weather did not clear in time, the effort was called off. The official reason for the scrub was `` lightning within five miles of the launch pad.'' The launch was rescheduled for no earlier than Friday. Officials said the long delay is necessary because of other launch activity in the next week. A schedule conflict with last Tuesday's launch of space shuttle <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and thunderstorms resulted in three earlier postponements. The $ 65 million Navstar satellite is to join a network of navigation spacecraft that can tell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and allied military forces where they are anywhere in the world - on land, sea or in the air, and in any weather. The satellite is the third of 21 improved <PERSON> Navstars </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992. The first two were launched in February and June.

 Two bicycle-riding Sinhalese gunmen on Sunday assassinated the government television's chief news editor, the third prominent broadcast official to be killed in the past 24 days, military officials said. <PERSON> Kulasiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaratunga </PERSON>, 62, was shot in the neck Sunday morning at his home in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lavinia </LOCATION>, a seaside resort town 6 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, according to the officials, who under briefing rules can not be identified.

More than 4,000 people have been killed in the past two years after the front condemned the government for its peacemaking efforts with the Tamil minority. All three government broadcasters who were killed were Sinhalese. The Sri Lankan military officials reported 13 other killings in other violence during a 24-hour period ending at 8 a.m. Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Syrian troops reportedly overran a Christian-held strategic mountaintop town Sunday, tightening the noose around the Christian heartland as savage rocket and artillery duels raged in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. There was no immediate casualty report from the confrontation in the town of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Gharb </LOCATION>, but police said at least four people were killed and 27 wounded in the indiscriminate exchanges across the capital Sunday. A police spokesman acknowledged that the count did not include many civilians trapped under blazing buildings in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` No one can reach them because of the intensity of the shelling,'' said the spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing regulations. The new casualties brought the overall toll to 626 killed and 1,660 wounded since March 8 when the latest confrontation erupted between army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> troops and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 soldiers and their Moslem militia allies. The siege started one week after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an effort to recoup $ 100 million in customs dues lost annually. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the mainly Christian units controlling Souk al-Gharb foiled an attempt to capture the town and mounted a counterattack, engaging Syrian, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Druse forces in fierce close-quarter combat. But an official of Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the Syrian army's 41st brigade, led by Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Hashem </PERSON> <PERSON> Moallak </PERSON>, overran Souk al-Gharb and surrounding hilltop hamlets Sunday. It was the first major ground thrust reported since the current round of fighting erupted in March. The Druse official, who refused to be named, said Druse militiamen and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> dissidents opposed to <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, took part in the tank-led attack on <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Gharb </LOCATION>, 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said they could not confirm or deny either of the conflicting claims but reported heavy fighting in <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> al-Gharb </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Sunday Times reported that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> believes two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held captive by an Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem group died shortly after being ambushed in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1986. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the army's chief spokesman, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON>, refused to confirm or deny the report but said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers its prisoners of war to be alive unless it has documentary proof to the contrary. `` By proof, we do not mean through the British media or other media, but through the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. The weekly, quoting unidentified senior sources in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> government, said Sunday that intelligence officers interrogating Sheikh <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> have concluded the soldiers died from wounds after being ambushed near <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yahoun </LOCATION> in February 1986. Israeli commandos captured <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, the reputed leader of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, in a daring raid inside the Lebanese border July 28. Israeli officials have said they were willing to exchange <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> for three captured <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers including the two cited in the Times story. The newspaper also said the parents of the soldiers were informed by the military that their sons were dead, but both families told the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> that they received no such report. The family of one of the soldiers, <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, refused to comment when contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had long been aware that the soldiers, <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rahamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsheik </PERSON>, were injured when they were captured Feb. 17, 1986, but believed that at least one of the soldiers survived. After questioning <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, the Israeli government believes one of the soldiers died 15 minutes after the ambush and the other died hours later, the weekly said. Security officials said they believed last week that neither <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> nor <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> knew that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had learned its soldiers were dead, the weekly reported. The newspaper said the third Israeli missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, air force navigator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> whose fighter jet was shot down over <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> in Oct. 16, 1986, is believed to be alive but is being held by <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> militia with closer ties to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The weekly, quoting security sources in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has told his Cabinet not to publicly discuss the matter of the two ambushed soldiers and has tried to keep it secret from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to offset <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pressure to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> in exchange for Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` Israeli leaders know that agreeing to such an American request would help mend the recent strains in Israeli-American ties; but they fear that <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s release would prompt criticism at home that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> risked the lives of its soldiers for an operation that solely benefited <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 Police were attacked with gasoline bombs early Sunday in rioting that followed a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> parade celebrating a 300-year-old victory over the forces of a Roman Catholic king. Police used batons to disperse the crowd of 200 gathered in an area of the city where disturbances are common after the annual Apprentice Boys' Parade. `` Officers were attacked by petrol bombs thrown by a riotous mob of 200,'' said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> police force. No injuries were reported, he said on condition of anonymity. Twenty years ago, the Apprentice Boys' Parade caused riots in Roman Catholic districts of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> and led to the dispatching of British troops to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> three days later on Aug. 14, 1969. Catholics plan their own march Monday to mark the anniversary, followed by a speech by <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON> <PERSON> McAliskey </PERSON>, a prominent figure in the republican movement in the 1960s. On Saturday, four hours before thousands of Protestants marched peacefully along city streets banging drums, security forces found a bomb in a bar near a gate to the Catholic section of <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION>, known as Bogside. The bomb went off as it was being defused by British army experts. It shattered glass in the Apprentice Boys Memorial Hall, but no one was injured. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> later claimed responsibility and said in a statement that the bomb was timed to go off while security forces toured the area to demonstrate the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> could strike in spite of tight security.

 Rescue workers on Sunday located the wreckage of a plane that crashed six days ago with Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 15 other people aboard. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said no survivors were found. The plane crashed in <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION>, a town in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> 30 miles from the Sudanese border and 60 miles from the refugee camp where the aircraft was headed, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. The plane went down in rugged highlands near two dirt airstrips the pilot may have been trying to reach because of bad weather near the refugee camp. `` The crash site was located. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters put down. They have confirmed 13 dead, and the presumption is that the other three are also dead,'' <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said in a telephone interivew. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters discovered the crash site, `` <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jumpers jumped out of a UH-60 helicopter and ... they confirmed there were no survivors at the site.'' However, spokesman <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sudin </PERSON>, who read the statement, also said the jumpers accounted for only 13 people and that it appeared that three were missing. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunger </ORGANIZATION>, was accompanied by eight Americans. They included three members of his staff, a friend of the congressman, three workers for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, and the wife of one of the AID officials. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, `` <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> and I were truly saddened to hear that the discovery of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s aircraft revealed that apparently there were no survivors of this tragic accident. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and the other members of his traveling party, both Americans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the hungry. `` I have known, admired and worked with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> for many years. His sense of compassion and desire to help those in need has aided millions of people from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>.'' The twin-engine Twin Otter vanished Aug. 7 in bad weather. The rescue workers did not immediately speculate on the cause of the crash. However, <PERSON> Gambela </PERSON> and the village of <LOCATION> Dembidola </LOCATION> just to the north had been an early focus of the search because there are two rough, dirt airstrips nearby. The pilot may have diverted to one of those strips because of heavy clouds and low visibility at <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s intended destination. The Ethiopian government said peasants had heard a light plane circling one and possibly two other dirt strips 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION> on Monday. Since the plane disappeared, an aerial and ground search by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> personnel had been carried out daily. At one point, weather satellites detected what appeared to be airplane distress signals far from the intended flight path, but a search of those areas turned up nothing. The seven others on board were all Ethiopian. They included a three-member crew, an officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, an officer of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, another official and an employee of AID. Earlier Sunday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> rescuers had extended their search for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s Twin Otter airplane into eastern <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. On Saturday, searchers had concentrated their efforts on valleys and mountains in a 100,000-square-mile area about the size of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. Another Embassy spokesman, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, said four <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopters and six other aircraft searched Sunday along the path the plane was to take to the camp in <LOCATION> Fugnido </LOCATION>, 480 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. Ethiopian authorities said it was cloudy in the search area and visibility was poor Sunday. Bad weather had dogged the operation since it began Tuesday. Fugnido is the site of one of four refugee camps in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. Fugnido houses more than 300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and a civil war in their own country. A C-141 Hercules aircraft with additional personnel and equipment arrived Saturday to help in the search. The reinforcements, including 100 more searchers, were sent mainly to relieve fliers of two Hercules already involved in the effort. They had been flying from dawn to sunset since they arrived from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Tuesday.

Air Force Col. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, commander of the five-man crew, guided the 97-ton winged spaceship to a touchdown on a hard clay runway at 6:37 a.m. PDT after a flight that covered more than 2 million miles in five days, one hour. `` A super team and a great machine _ welcome home, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Culbertson </PERSON>, an astronaut who served as the spacecraft communicator at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, told the crew as the spacecraft rolled down the runway after a perfect landing. After securing systems aboard the spacecraft for nearly an hour, the astronauts left the vehicle and did a walkaround inspection. They found a few of the 30,000 heat protection tiles missing, a normal condition. Then they were driven to a nearby facility for physical exams and showers. An hour before landing, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> fired twin braking rockets to drop the shuttle out of orbit and start it on a fiery dive through the atmosphere and into this desert air base 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Mission Control lifted its curtain of silence to report the successful firing. `` All parties here report a good deorbit burn; all systems aboard <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> are clean,'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, the control center commentator, reported. Sonic booms cracked overhead as <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> descended through a clear sky and made its sweeping approach to runway 17 on <LOCATION> Rogers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. The weather here was ideal, with clear skies, unlimited visibility and mild temperatures. Although as many as half a million people have flocked to the desert air base to watch previous shuttles land, Sunday's touchdown was closed to the public because of the classified nature of the mission. Most news about the flight has been blacked out on <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> orders since an overhauled <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> lifted off from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> last Tuesday on its first flight in 3 -LCB- years. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> was allowed to make only periodic statements that spacecraft and crew were fine and to disclose the landing day and then the time. Sources close to the project said the main goal of the flight was the deployment of a sophisticated, 10-ton spy satellite designed to snap highly detailed photographs of military installations, troop movements and other targets of interest around the world. It would help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> verify Soviet compliance with arms treaties, just as Russian satellites do over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> confirmed Wednesday that a satellite was deployed by the astronauts during their first day in orbit, but he would n't discuss its purpose. To prepare for the trip back to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> commander <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> conducted a series of tests Saturday to make certain the shuttle's computers and control jets were ready. In addition, mission specialists <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> stowed several experiments. Some of those tests were believed to be connected with the `` Star Wars'' missile defense project, while others involved determining how people can serve as military observers from space. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, the oldest shuttle, last flew in January 1986, landing 10 days before the Challenger explosion that killed the crew of seven. After the accident <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> concentrated on making safety modifications to the two newer shuttles, Discovery and Atlantis, before turning attention to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Discovery and Atlantis each has made two space trips since flights resumed last September. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s return restored the shuttle flight to three vehicles at a time when the launch rate is increasing, with three more flights planned this year and nine in 1990. Another orbiter is being built as a replacement for Challenger and is scheduled for its first launch in early 1992.

<HEAD>HUD Secretary Got Tons of Letters Seeking Favors</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The elderly man decked out in his Sunday best posed proudly in the sunlight of a liquor store parking lot, hoping the new <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary would see a family resemblance in that dignified profile. He wrote to <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, that his mother's maiden name, too, was <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, and she was from <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wrote back that he was from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and he was sure they were n't kin. That letter was one of hundreds amassed by <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> during the eight years he served at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Normally, a housing secretary's government files would be packed off to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION> where they would receive scant attention from historians, who would find sexier things to write about than the tenure of a man who managed to remain in obscurity throughout his time in office. But the $ 2 billion scandal of influence peddling and outright theft that pervaded the department during the <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> years has changed all that. For a time during the past couple of weeks, the crowd of reporters wanting to thumb through his files was so big the public affairs office at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> was taking reservations. One theme comes through the 48 boxes of speeches, letters, bureaucratic jargon, `` grip' n' grin'' photographs and mind-numbing meeting minutes: Many of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s pen pals were on the make. The vast majority wanted a job, some money, some time. They tugged at every string they could find, a chance meeting at a cocktail party, a handshake at a graduation ceremony, a family friend in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a seat at the Cabinet table. `` Dear <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' began the 1981 letter from the late <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, trying to boost the fortunes of the son of a deceased law partner. `` He's had a lot of experience in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, is a GS-14, is a proven Republican, has philosophical credentials, and is the kind of fellow who ought to be brought up from the bureaucracy into policy work,'' <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> wrote of his friend's son. While the letters were as different as the people who composed them, one thing all of the writers had in common was the probability that they would be horrified at the thought of their letters being dug out of the files by squads of chortling reporters. Finding the word `` CONFIDENTIAL'' across the top of a letter discovered in these files now has an effect entirely opposite from the one intended. Instead of `` keep this to yourself,'' it now means `` Xerox me.'' One such confidential memorandum was written in 1985 by <PERSON> Bernice </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who at the time was director of the office of small and disadvantaged business utilization. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> had gotten into a spat with <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s executive assistant and now is a central figure in the investigations of influence peddling. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> himself had said that Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> enjoyed power and was not reluctant about using it to flatten people in her path. While the files do not show what started the tiff, the incident that brought it to a memo-writing fury was when Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees to Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' office to cart away the furniture. After leading off with Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s `` lack of sophistication and immaturity,'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> went on to call her a liar and say, `` I am not intimidated by your threats.'' `` It is my hope that attitudinal vindictiveness be put aside in the interest of effectively carrying out the secretary's goals and objectives,'' Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> wrote. A formal reply to Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> was not found in the files, but the fact that someone had marked her errors of spelling and grammar gives some indication of what the tone must have been. Some of the papers in the files are dripping with irony, such as the note <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> sent to all <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees four years ago, urging them to report any `` knowledge of waste, fraud and mismanagement.'' `` The law provides broad protection from any reprisal being taken against you for making such reports, and I give you my personal assurance that I will not tolerate any such reprisal,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wrote. On the back of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s memo was typed a three-paragraph letter from <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieren </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employee from <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, who blew the whistle on wrongdoing in the department, got fired and spent 18 months in court to get his job back. `` My experience to report fraud, waste and mismanagement was a horror story that I for one do not want to experience again,'' <PERSON> Kieren </PERSON> wrote. Other letters, now viewed with the 20-20 vision of hindsight, might make their authors squirm. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> received a pair of thank-you letters from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, both of whom have served as the agency's top investigators and have been instrumental in exposing fraud and waste in <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s department. `` I've told you previously how much I appreciated your support and backing,'' <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON> wrote in thanking <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for attending his 1985 retirement party as the department's inspector general. In his own note, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Dempsey </PERSON>, wrote that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> made the event `` an evening neither <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> nor the others who were there will soon forget.'' Some of the paper in the files gives a glimpse of what <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> himself was like. It seems that rarely did anyone he know experience an illness or a death in the family that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> did n't write a thoughtful note In one case he wrote a letter of condolence over the passing of `` Muffin,'' apparently a family's pet He also was mindful of the perks of his office, once inquiring as to the free use of a restored presidential yacht, and demanding in his extensive travels that he be accorded treatment befitting a member of the president's <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. In 1987, that trait nearly provoked an international incident at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s first-class reservations on a flight to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> were loused up. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> demanded an aisle seat in the first-class cabin, and an airline employee, <PERSON> Sami </PERSON> <PERSON> Asfahani </PERSON>, went aboard to find a place for the secretary to sit. `` In the course of events, Mr. <PERSON> Asfahani </PERSON> politely requested members of a <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> prince's party to rearrange their seating so that I could secure the type of aisle seat I had requested,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wrote in a letter to the chairman of the board of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` Certain members of the prince's party overreacted in my opinion,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> wrote.

<HEAD>Taiwan Shipping Company Loses Suit Against China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Chinese court has ruled against the first company from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to sue <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, rejecting the claim that a Taiwanese ship captain was intimidated into confessing to smuggling, a pro-Beijing newspaper said Sunday. The Chinese-language newspaper <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Zhuhai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday upheld the action of Chinese customs officials and ordered the captain to pay $ 5,770 in court costs. On March 6, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> patrol boat seized the 1,963-ton Taiwanese ship, Kuang Ta No. 2, near <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> while it carried 31 crew members and 4,760 cartons of cigarettes. Authorities released the ship and crew several days later after captain <PERSON> Tsai </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng-Hsiung </PERSON> signed a confession that he was smuggling cigarettes. On April 11, the captain filed suit in <LOCATION> Zhuhai </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> port about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. In the suit, the <ORGANIZATION> Kuang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> argued that the confession was signed under `` threat, tiring interrogation and the acute desire to release the ship and crew.'' It demanded $ 4.3 million in compensation and return of the confiscated cigarettes. In its decision, the court rejected the company's argument that the confession was extorted and that ship was in international waters, the paper said. The Chinese had said the ship was in Chinese waters and its crew planned to sell cigarettes to Chinese fishermen, a violation of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> customs laws. Both the Nationalist government in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> and the Communist government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have claimed to be the sole legitimate ruler of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1949, when Communist forces drove the Nationalists from the Chinese mainland. Recently, the two countries have relaxed restrictions on Taiwanese visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>British Liberties: Among The Casualties Of Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Behind the lives destroyed in 20 years of violence in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> lies another casualty: the corruption of civil liberties in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> itself. In its attempts to crush the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a nation that ranks among the world's older democracies has adopted laws which opponents say would look more at home in a dictatorship. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> defends the practice of detaining suspects for a week without charging them or banning British radio and television stations from broadcasting interviews with <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members as part of the price for fighting terrorism. `` To beat off your enemy in a war you have to suspend some of your civil liberties for a time,'' she said after last October's imposition of the broadcast ban, which also covers members and sympathizers of 10 other militant groups `` None of us can be neutral as between the terrorist and the law-abiding citizen,'' added Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who survived an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> hotel bombing in 1984 that killed five people, including two senior <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> figures. Her critics, however, detect a gradual warping of democratic freedoms since `` the troubles'' flared and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> dispatched troops on Aug. 14, 1969 to keep <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s Protestants and Catholics apart. Twenty years later, the troops remain. The Financial Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, in an editorial in December, commented on `` a lengthening list of recent government decisions each of which has given greater weight to reasons of state than to the civic rights of the individual. Most, but not all, arise from the troubles in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.'' However, the most controversial legislation, the Prevention of Terrorism Act, is a legacy of a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government _ enacted in 1978 after 21 civilians were killed by an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bomb in an English pub. The act, which applies throughout what is known formally as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, includes police powers to detain suspects for up to a week without charge. In the decade of rule by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservative government, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s death toll climbed past 2,700 and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has been cited 21 times _ the most by any country _ for violating the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. Her government imposed the broadcast ban on paramilitary groups and limited, or proposed limiting, the right of a suspect to remain silent. Since last fall, courts in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> have been able to interpret an accused's silence after arrest as an indication, in some circumstances, of guilt. Those circumstances are: _ Failing to mention during interrogation any fact offered in defense at trial. _ Refusing to be sworn or answer questions at trial. _ Failing to explain any possessions or marks on the defendant's clothing or person at the time of arrest _ Failing to give an account for being at a particular place at the time of arrest. The courts themselves, which are convened without juries which might be intimidated or split along sectarian lines, are also an extraordinary step taken in 1973 to combat terrorism. Last month, a government advisory panel proposed limiting the right of silence for ordinary criminals in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION>. Regulations under the anti-terrorist act have been used to compel photographers and television stations to hand over material to help police investigations. TV networks complained their crews were put in added danger after being compelled last year to hand over unscreened footage of an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> funeral march in which two British soldiers were murdered by a mob. `` We'd been pushed another step down a road with an uncertain ending,'' commented <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON>, an executive with <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Thames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> station, after giving police tape of an interview with a suspected terrorist. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s run-ins with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> are partly due to the fact that this country has no written bill of rights or constitution and thus issues are automatically transferred to the court in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, instead of being filtered through domestic courts. Last November, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> refused to implement a ruling by the 19-judge court that the anti-terrorism act's detention powers violate the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> and should be repealed. The case was brought by four <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> men who were held for between 4 -LCB- days and a week in 1984 and then released. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> invoked an article of the convention that says the ruling need not be accepted `` in time of war or public emergency threatening the life of the nation.''

<HEAD>Grain Farmers Get Easy Targets in Foreign Currency Experiment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet authorities have set relatively easy targets for collective farms in an experiment designed to increase grain production by paying for excess crops in convertible currency, a newspaper said Sunday. The newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> said farms will be paid in dollars and other world currencies for any high-quality grain they produce above their average for 1981-85. The entire <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> produced an average of 180 million metric tons of grain during that period, far less than the 210-211 million metric tons produced in the record years of 1986 and 1987. Soviet authorities hope to stimulate domestic grain production enough to reduce purchases of grain on the world market. Farms will be allowed to spend their hard currency as they wish to obtain Western combines, food-processing equipment and other items, the newspaper said. It was not clear if the farms could choose to buy consumer goods. For peas and oil crops, the standard will be more difficult: the average production of 1986-88, which were fairly good years. The two-year experiment will apply to collective and state farms, the newspaper said. Authorities are still debating whether to allow farmers on the new leasing program to join. American economist <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, commenting on the program when it was proposed in June, said it could undercut the attempt to convert farms to individual leaseholds. He predicted that collective farms seeking to break previous records to obtain foreign currency will be unwilling to allow individual farmers to break out on their own and lease part of the farm's land.

<TEXT>
 A new school is being named after <PERSON> David </PERSON> `` the bubble boy,'' the youngster unable to fight disease who died at the age of 12 after spending most of his life in a series of bubble-like sterile isolators. <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s parents were joined Friday by relatives and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Conroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> during ground-breaking ceremonies for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Elementary </PERSON> in this community north of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` He inspired all of us,'' said his mother, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>. `` I want students to be inspired by his experiences as well.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who died 5 -LCB- years ago, lived all but the last two weeks of his life in sealed, sterile surroundings. The news media throughout that time and since have upheld an agreement not to disclose his family's last name. School district Superintendent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said schools are rarely named after students, but <PERSON> David </PERSON> deserved it because his life typified `` the courage so important to the American character.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s life will be remembered in a selection of material in a reading room of the school's library, <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said. He said the school also will have an outdoor education center because district officials `` felt that would please <PERSON> David </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> attended elementary school through the fifth grade in The Woodlands and developed a `` wonderful interest'' in education, his mother said. He also had a keen interest in the outdoors and dreamed of `` running through the grass barefooted,'' she said. `` It's fitting that the school would be here, in the forest,'' she said. <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s isolation was needed to keep out germs because he was born with a condition known as severe combined immunodeficiency disease. About 30 to 50 children are born with this disorder in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year, and they have little or no natural resistance to infections. Doctors tried to construct his immune system by giving him healthy bone marrow, the source of disease-fighting blood cells, donated by his sister. The transplanted cells did not survive, but they apparently infected him with a common virus which caused runaway cancer of his white blood cells, and he died Feb. 22, 1984. It was the first conclusive evidence of cancer developing in a human after infection by a virus, said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shearer </PERSON>, <PERSON> David </PERSON>'s physician at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Children's Hospital in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.

The announcement, carried by <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, came one day after the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported the two countries had agreed on their first joint venture, which will make medical equipment. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s government-run Agrideb company, expressed hope that the new farm sector company, <PERSON> Agromir </PERSON>, would help solve the Soviet food crisis. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> cut diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to protest its occupation of territories belonging to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. But cultural and tourism exchanges have expanded since the two countries exchanged interest offices in 1987 and 1988. <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s advanced agricultural technology contributed to the Soviet desire `` to cooperate on a concrete, business basis, without any political implications.'' The radio reported that the agreement was signed Saturday at the end of a 12-day visit by a five-member delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, which surveyed Israeli agricultural techniques. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Olmert </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in September, to be followed by other Israeli specialists in October. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Hadashot </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said the Soviets will import farm and dairy equipment from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, as well as 200 cows. It also said <PERSON> Agromir </PERSON> will create a crop and poultry farm near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Issue of Deposit Insurance Lingers Past Bailout Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite the self-congratulatory back slapping surrounding enactment of landmark savings and loan legislation last week, many experts say the government failed to address one of the root causes of the bailout _ the deposit insurance system itself. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bill, at $ 159 billion the largest financial rescue in the nation's history, in a Rose Garden ceremony attended Wednesday by smiling Cabinet secretaries and leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` It'll safeguard and stabilize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s financial system and put in place permanent reforms so these problems will never happen again,'' he said before handing out souvenir pens to legislators who helped pass the law. But a growing group of conservative, and some not-so-conservative, thinkers believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ca n't really make that promise until policy-makers tackle the politically explosive issue of deposit insurance reform. White House economic advisers, just before President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left office, tried to raise the issue, suggesting that deposit insurance ought to be `` curbed.'' But, even that vague recommendation raised a firestorm of criticism in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rather than mire emergency <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L legislation in endless debate, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration decided to postpone the question by ordering the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to study the issue and report its findings in 18 months. Academic analysts, however, say the debate should not have been postponed. They argue that it is deposit insurance that not only put each taxpayer on the hook for $ 1,000 over 30 years, but encouraged <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to run up the losses in the first place. In a phenomenon economists call `` moral hazard,'' thrifts that had lost their owners' investment had every incentive to gamble with federally insured deposits. If outlandish loans to sperm banks and windmill farms paid off, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners recovered earlier losses. If the investments soured, as they usually did, the insurance fund had to pay. `` The perverse incentives of federal deposit insurance allowed the drunk drivers of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L world to operate without paying any more for insurance than their sober brothers,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. He advocates privatizing the system by allowing banks to form syndicates to cross-guarantee one another. Banks with risky portfolios would pay higher deposit insurance fees, instead of the flat rate all banks pay to the government no matter how well run. <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>'s plan is just one of many floating around. Some, like his, would do away with the federal system established in 1934 as the cure to the wave of bank failures that swept the nation in the early years of the Depression. Others would tinker with, but not abolish, the system in an attempt to inject more `` depositor discipline.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest bank, advocates reducing the $ 100,000 per account insurance limit and subjecting deposits over that to a 10 percent to 15 percent `` haircut'' in the event of failure. That system, similar to <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s, would, in effect, impose a deductible. Just as motorists who have to pay the first $ 200 damage from an auto accident in theory drive more carefully than fully-insured car owners, depositors who could lose some of their money will pay more attention to where they open accounts. Other reform proposals, such as one offered by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Issac </PERSON>, former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would limit depositors to one insured account in an attempt to get at the practice of brokering deposits, that is splitting large sums into $ 100,000 pieces and parceling them out to different institutions so the entire amount is insured. All of the proposals likely will be examined by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in its study. After that, in early 1991, the issue returns to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But few are expecting <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve anything but incremental changes at most. `` I suspect it will not promote anything radical,'' said <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>, which under last week's legislation now insures <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits as well as bank accounts `` We have just invented a whole new logo -LRB- for banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls -RRB- saying the government's full faith and credit is behind those deposits. I think any attempt to change that will be very difficult,'' said <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, whose agency released its own study early this year concluding that the benefits of deposit insurance outweigh the drawbacks. Those who oppose tinkering with deposit insurance make three arguments: that the system has worked, preventing bank runs for the past five decades; that doing away with the system would force banks to lend only to big organizations, drying up credit to small businesses, and that curbing deposit insurance would help big bank holding companies at the expense of small community institutions. One premise of advocates of insurance reform is that a bank run, a contained bank run, is not something to fear more than the failure of any other kind of business. Rather, the threat of a run acts to encourage sound banking. `` The Depression so traumatized us that we do n't even want to think about a bank failure,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaufman </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` An individual bank run is really not bad at all except for the individual bank. If a bank thinks there is a possibility of a run, they're going to behave a lot differently than if they do n't.'' The flaw in that argument, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal oriented think tank in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is that regulators can never be sure a bank run wo n't spread. Even the healthiest banks do n't have enough cash to pay off all depositors all at once and just a hint of trouble can spark a run. `` In theory, there's nothing wrong with letting one bank fail,'' <PERSON> Litan </PERSON> said. `` But any policy-maker faced with that choice generally does n't want to go down in the history books as running an experiment that allowed the system to go down.'' Moreover, according to <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, for depositor discipline to work, depositors must be able to easily and quickly determine their bank's condition. `` I do n't think we can depend upon depositors to know on a daily basis the condition of their banks. We -LRB- at the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- have great problems doing that, even with thousands of bank supervisors,'' he said.

 Up a grimy staircase, through a dim hallway and into a fourth-floor apartment, the Beatles are playing and <PERSON> Kolya </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> is preaching to a new generation the Beatles gospel he accepted a quarter-century ago. From long ago and far away, the Beatles have had a grip on Soviet youth, many of whom have lost faith in government and been denied free access to religion. `` In your country, rock' n' roll is just music,'' 19-year-old <PERSON> Dima </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasiliev </PERSON>, a budding guitarist, told an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> reporter. `` Here it's our soul, our heart. If there were n't rock and roll, I'd be a Young Pioneer or Komsomol member,'' he said, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> youth groups. `` The Beatles and what they did had a special effect on <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>, 43, who describes himself as the Fab Four's biggest Soviet fan and a `` Beatleologist. With his long black beard, he could be mistaken for a Russian Orthodox priest but for the <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> T-shirt he wears. `` Here, in a spiritual hunger, it's indescribable. It's a substitute for religion,'' he said. Memorabilia is everywhere in <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>'s single grubby room, his part of an apartment shared with two other families. It is a shrine, museum, dining room, living room and bedroom all in one. Shelves from ceiling to floor are filled with Beatles books and buttons. Walls are lined with `` A Hard Day's Night'' and `` Yellow Submarine'' posters and portraits of <PERSON> John </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON>. Like an eternal flame, a lamp atop the bookshelf continuously throws orange light onto a photograph of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON>, who was murdered in 1980. A small sign in front reads in English, `` Bless You.'' <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>'s proudest possession is a red, white and blue soccer jersey he says <PERSON> Lennon </PERSON> wore. He said he got it through a friend of singer <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baez </PERSON>. About a dozen teen-agers are sitting around a table as Beatles music blares from a tape recorder. `` What's the name of that song?'' <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> demands of one. The boy shrugs his shoulders. `` I'll have to call your mother about that tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> says jokingly. <PERSON> Vasiliev </PERSON> calls <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> his spiritual father who `` taught us that there's more than what school and parents taught us.'' The teen-agers come by regularly to sing, dance and talk music. <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> takes his Beatlemania seriously. He's been at it for 25 years, since a friend played him a tape recorded off <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` Something happened,'' he recalled. `` The words used were the best. It was a high. Like God, sacred. A love hit me which I did n't have before, only love for my mother. <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>, a painter, made himself an expert on Beatles trivia. He collected more than 15,000 Beatles photos, all of their albums, bootlegged recordings and every scrap of paper about them he could find. As `` I Saw Her Standing There,'' `` Help,'' and `` Norwegian Wood'' resounded, he showed a reporter two Beatles `` encyclopedias'' he painstakingly compiled, including newspaper clippings, photographs and poetry by or about the Beatles. Two articles serve as reminders that Beatles music and the lifestyle they represented once were officially frowned on. `` These bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions,'' the satirical magazine <PERSON> Krokodil </PERSON> wrote in 1964. In the same year, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> titled his condemnation of the Beatles in Literary Gazette, `` From the <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bees </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bugs </ORGANIZATION>.'' Beatles records were banned, but <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beatles </LOCATION> fans found other sources: foreign radio broadcasts and smuggled albums. Still, just listening was n't enough. By 1966, he recalled, `` People you would meet on the street talked not about their illnesses or studies. The subject was the Beatles. They were also the main subject of telephone calls.'' The group's music spawned dozens of copycat groups in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and gave birth to original Soviet rock, such as the group Aquarium, which recently signed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recording contract and whose lead singer, <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Grebenshchikov </PERSON>, credits the Beatles with changing his life. Fans held Beatles festivals, swapped tapes and photos, bought their albums for exhorbitant prices on the black market, and some sported their familiar haircuts and dressed like them in jackets with round collars and no lapels. <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> says some were arrested for `` hooliganism'' and `` anti-social behavior.'' One teen-ager at <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON>'s apartment said police fined his father for playing Beatles music too loudly. The first positive press report about the group appeared in 1968, and <PERSON> Vasin </PERSON> recalls in a Soviet rock history book titled `` Back in the U.S.S.R.'' that he was so happy he ran around <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> with the article in his hand shouting, `` We've won!'' More than two decades after they rocketed to the top of Western music charts, the Beatles began to receive official recognition here. The state record company <ORGANIZATION> Melodia </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 issued `` A Taste of Honey'' and `` A Hard Day's Night.'' Some singles had been released earlier without mentioning the group's name, because <ORGANIZATION> Melodia </ORGANIZATION> did n't legally obtain permission to distribute them Soviet Beatlemania has not gone unnoticed by the people who made the music. In November, <PERSON> Melodia </PERSON> released `` Back in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>,'' a collecton of old rock' n' roll songs <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> recorded exclusively for <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> fans. He also paid tribute to them in January in a phone-in show on the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> service. He said he would like to perform in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and that he admired <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> fans for following the Beatles despite official harassment. `` It did n't put us off, Russians. We love you madly,'' he said.

<HEAD>Congress Weighs Whether Mt. McKinley Should Be Mt. Denali Instead</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Add one more issue to the list of conundrums <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have to unravel when it returns from its summer recess next month: whether the tallest mountain in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> should be renamed. It's a perennial duel between an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> congressman protecting the honor of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, the 25th <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president after whom the peak is named, and an <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> senator defending his state's right to name its own land features. The motives of Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, are easy to discern. `` His long-range goal is to see if the mountain can be renamed with Alaskans' wishes,'' says <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Godwin </PERSON>, his spokeswoman. It takes only a quick look at the background of Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, to explain why he cares about the name of the 20,320-foot mountain in central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, a continent away from the people he represents. `` <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> is from my district,'' <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> says. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, assassinated in 1901, was not only from <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>'s district, but once held <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>'s seat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and is buried in the district <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> is even a graduate of the <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> School of Law. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> _ the mountain _ is in <LOCATION> Denali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, which was renamed in 1980 from McKinley National Park. <PERSON> Denali </PERSON> is an Indian word for `` The Great One,'' and many Alaskans would like to see the mountain bear the same name. `` It's owned by 230 million Americans,'' <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> said last week. `` <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> gets millions of dollars in taxes, and taxpayers from the entire country have a right to decide what happens there.'' A provision forbidding the government to rename the mountain was buried in the fine print of the annual <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spending bill that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed July 12. When the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved its version of the legislation two weeks later, the Mt. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> language was removed. It's a legislative dance that has been going on for years, and <PERSON> Regula </PERSON> has always prevailed. `` <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> goes along with a one-year prohibition, but not with statutorily naming it Mt. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>,'' says <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>. Like most geographic features, Mt. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> was not given its name by law. Rather, its name is officially recognized by the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Names </ORGANIZATION>, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. It was named Mt. <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> in 1896, when <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON> was <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> governor and the Republican presidential candidate against Democrat <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>. In 1975, the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> state legislature passed a resolution requesting that the park and the mountain be renamed to <LOCATION> Denali </LOCATION>. Congressional hearings were held two years later. In a compromise, the park was renamed in 1980 but the mountain retained its name. Negotiators from the two chambers probably will meet next month to work out a compromise bill.

 Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> dipped into the money pools of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> for more than $ 2 million in campaign funds during the first seven months of the year even though there is no <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> challenger in sight for his 1990 re-election bid.

Despite the contributions and Republican Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>'s recent assertion that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> is unbeatable, the campaign is taking nothing for granted as it looks for an additional $ 6 million `` Let's remember there is a governor's race in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatiello </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s campaign manager, in explaining the lack of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates stepping forward so far. `` This is going to be an expensive <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race,'' predicted <PERSON> Donatiello </PERSON>. `` We would like to have $ 9 million to spend on the campaign.'' In 1984, <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> spent $ 5.1 million to hold onto his seat, compared with $ 956,000 spent by Republican <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mochary </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has been mentioned for years as presidential material, <PERSON> Donatiello </PERSON> put aside questions that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> might be filling his coffers in anticipation of a 1992 White House bid. `` There's always the speculation,'' he said. `` We fully expect to spend all the money we raise for the 1990 campaign on the'90 campaign. `` In order to run in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, you have to buy five <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> races'' worth of media time _ for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and the most expensive media market of all, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> agreed. `` It's fairly prudent for a senator to run a decent amount of TV. Secondly, think about what percentage of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population is within those media markets. He's going to get a piece of the country in terms of 1992,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> has opted to be safe and at the same time leave his political options open. `` Politicians always run scared, assume the worst and prepare for it,'' said <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>. `` Therefore, you raise money if you're able to as a way of discouraging whatever potential opposition may surface and being ready to wage a serious campaign if you need to.'' Looking at <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s ability to raise $ 4.3 million toward 1990, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said: `` All of it fits in well with a potential run for the presidency in 1992 or 1996 in any case. It seems very sensible even if he has n't decided if he's going to do that.''

 Leaders of little Woolstock, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, say they're not about to allow a concert in the town park on the anniversary of the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> rock festival because they're worried about drugs and undesirables. But the radio station sponsoring the event said the show will go on whether the city likes it or not, on private land if need be. And besides, how many undesirables are going to show up at supper time on a week night? Even if there are free hot dogs? The City Council in the north-central <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> town of 230 people voted 4-1 Friday to prohibit radio station <ORGANIZATION> KRIT </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, about 20 miles from <LOCATION> Woolstock </LOCATION>, from holding a two-hour concert at the park Tuesday night to observe the 20th anniversary of <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. In 1969, a long list of leading rock groups attracted more than 500,000 people to a dairy farm in the Catskills of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, actually about 45 miles from <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>. KRIT officials said they were inspired to hold the concert because <LOCATION> Woolstock </LOCATION> is just a letter away from <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION>, but despite that similarity they said the town really does n't have to fear it will be overrun. Woolstock officials said they did n't want to take a chance. `` We're not an anti-social town,'' said Councilman <PERSON> Norval </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>, who voted with the majority. `` We like to have these gatherings. But we were kind of concerned about the element that might come in. The drug problem is bad enough as it is.'' Story and Woolstock Mayor <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellmeyer </PERSON> said the event could have been sponsored at the park if <ORGANIZATION> KRIT </ORGANIZATION> had given the town a little time to plan. Instead, they said, town officials learned of the event in newspaper accounts last week. `` I think they're blowing it up a little,'' said <ORGANIZATION> KRIT </ORGANIZATION> news director <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberts </PERSON>. `` Look, it's from 6 to 8 p.m., no alcohol will be allowed and it's in a fairly remote area on a Tuesday night, so you're not going to have that many people,'' she said. Instead of <LOCATION> Jimi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hendrix </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, Stills, <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the musical talent is <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Dohrmann </PERSON> of <PERSON> Barnum </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Lind </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dodge </LOCATION>, both guitarists. `` They're the most wholesome guys in the whole world,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alberts </PERSON> said. `` Sure, there will be music from the'60s and a sound system, but there wo n't even be any drums.'' `` And there ca n't be all that many people. If anybody has to work the next day, they certainly are n't going to drive too far. It's Tuesday night, after all.'' However, there will be the attraction of free hot dogs and soft drinks, courtesy of KRIT. <PERSON> Dorhmann </PERSON> does not have a telephone listing and no one answered the telephone at <PERSON> Lind </PERSON>'s residence. As for the failure to notify town officials in advance, Ms. <PERSON> Alberts </PERSON> said the radio station did n't know it needed to ask for permission. Besides, she said, the town did n't have to do anything. `` It's up to KRIT to do all the planning. It was our event. If a family were planning a reunion in the Woolstock city park, it's the family that puts it together,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Alberts </PERSON> said the radio station is determined to hold the event regardless of whether it has the blessing of the Woolstock council. `` This is going to happen no matter what,'' she said. `` Before the council met, an area farmer called us and said he suspected they would vote it down. He said we could use some of his land. `` And we got a call from a person in <LOCATION> Woolstock </LOCATION> who said he had a big lot where we could hold it.'' She said radio officials will visit the proposed sites and make a decision on where to hold the show by Monday morning.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Schools, Colleges, Strain Under Budget Cuts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Deep cuts in state spending will mean larger classes, closed schools, fewer teachers and fewer sports programs for the 1 million students returning to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> public schools and colleges next month, educators say. At the state's 29 public colleges and universities, students will feel the effects of a $ 39.3 million cut in higher education funding ordered by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The 1,800 public schools will have to shoulder their share of a $ 210 million reduction in state aid to cities and towns. Educators use words like `` disaster,'' `` tragedy,'' and `` devastation'' to describe the impact. The governor, who touted his state's booming economy during his unsuccessful presidential campaign last last year, only to be blindsided by a surge in red ink this year, expressed deep regret in announcing the cuts last month. But he said he had little choice but to carve $ 491 million out of the state's 1989-90 budget. The cuts and the withholding of funds were needed to bring the budget to $ 12.2 billion, in keeping with a balanced-budget provision in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Constitution. Schools in communities small and large are feeling the pinch. For example: _ <LOCATION> Brockton </LOCATION> is considering a plan to charge high-school atheletes to take part in sports programs. _ The small central <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> community of <LOCATION> Belchertown </LOCATION> may begin making students pay to ride the school buses. _ <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> will have to lay off at least 300 and possibly as many as 800 teachers out of a faculty of 2,000 because of a severe budget crisis in that city. All but a few athletic programs have been cut including soccer, ice hockey and swimming, according to Assistant Superintendent <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Southworth </PERSON>. _ Some 8,000 college students _ most of whom would attended community colleges, designed to serve the poorest sector of the community _ will be turned away. `` It is a cruel blow to schools,'' state education Commissioner <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raynolds </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said last week. `` There wo n't be a single school across the commonwealth that is intact as it was last spring.'' Higher education Chancellor <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON> said that despite a 7.7 percent tuition increase and steep hikes in student fees, the budget crisis has halted a push to advance the state's public college and university system into the nation's top rank. `` We will at best be doing worse than we were last year, and last year was a bad year,'' <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON> said. `` We've taken the position that one maintains quality at all costs. Access to mediocrity is no access at all.'' Higher education budget cuts will translate into 1,900 canceled course sections for the 120,000 full-time students, <PERSON> Jenifer </PERSON>'s staff has calculated. Some 1,200 part-time faculty and staff positions are being cut, and 8,000 student slots, most in community colleges, were eliminated for the fall term. No one will be turned away from public elementary and secondary schools. But because of faculty and staff cuts, some of the 824,000 public school students will be in bigger classes than before. Staff and faculty reductions at public schools across the state are expected to reach 8,000, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, a parents group and the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> have gone to court to block a plan to close six public schools and consolidate three others. `` Two years from now, people are going to be saying, ` How come our kids ca n't compete?''' said <PERSON> Rosanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're unwilling to spend our money on our kids. This is not the way they do things in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Navy Moving To Outflank Opponents Of Its Nuclear Blast Simulator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Barred from the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and hounded by environmentalists in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> now is trying to outflank its opponents as it eyes the Gulf of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to test whether ship electronics can withstand a nuclear blast in space. `` We've started a very active public information and availability program on the Gulf Coast,'' said Capt. W.E. <PERSON> Mahew </PERSON>, manager of the Electromagnetic Pulse Radiation Environment Simulator For Ships -LRB- Empress II -RRB- program. `` There was too much misinformation about what the program was -LRB- when it was proposed for the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> -RRB- and we were never able to counter that information,'' he said. `` The guy who got there first and told the story first was the only who was believed.'' Empress II consists of a barge-mounted, truncated cone of antennas _ 128 feet high and 200 feet in diameter _ that surround a pulser which can simulate the electromagnetic field that would be generated by a nuclear blast in space. The system generates an electromagnetic pulse -LRB- EMP -RRB- that lasts just 10 billionths of a second, but measures 50,000 volts per meter at 100 meters from the barge in all directions. The <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> is fired at passing ships to test the effectiveness of measures designed to protect electronics systems from the <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> that would be generated by a nuclear blast in space. While the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> insists that the <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION> generated by Empress II poses no risk to the environment and that exclusion zones around the barge will protect the electronic systems of nearby planes and boats, it has had a difficult time thus far making its case. `` They just have not accurately assessed the impact of this on human health, and what makes this particularly sad is that most of the people being exposed are people in the service,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON>, an attorney for the Foundation on Economic Trends. `` What we're seeing here is similar to the Army allowing those soldiers to be exposed to the first nuclear blasts -LRB- after World War II -RRB- and we know the high incidence of cancer that resulted there,'' he said. The foundation, a Washington-based watchdog group on emerging technologies, has filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> seeking to halt Empress II tests off the coast of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> adequately assesses the impact of the tests on human health and animal life and on the electronic circuitry of nearby airplanes and boats. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began operating the Empress II off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> in the summer of 1988 after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacted legislation prohibiting it from operating in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> until the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> demonstrated that the tests could be conducted no where else with less environmental impact. After the lawsuit was filed, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chose a new site off <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and conducted an environmental assessment that concluded the Empress II tests would have no significant environmental impact at the new site. As soon as the 30-day period for public comment on that assessment ended last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> resumed the Empress II tests at the new site. In the meantime, letters went out July 26 announcing that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> planned to begin the environmental assessment that could lead to a new test site for Empress II about 20 miles off the <LOCATION> Alabama-Mississippi </LOCATION> coast in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mahew </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> needs the Gulf site because weather conditions limit use of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> site to the summer months. Originally, winter testing was to have been conducted in the <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is planning 60 days of Empress II tests in the Gulf annually between October and April. Long before plans for the Gulf site were announced, however, <PERSON> Mahew </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> personnel were meeting with state and local officials and environmental groups in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> in order to `` get ahead of the opposition.'' `` We're laying it all out,'' he said. In four years of <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> and independent research on the effects of <ORGANIZATION> EMP </ORGANIZATION>, he argues, `` We've never been able to demonstrate any harm to human health, we've never been able to demonstrate any harm to marine biota Despite those claims, and despite its best public relations efforts, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> appears to be facing a long legal battle before it can pursue its plan for year-round Empress II tests in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and the Gulf. `` I'm not an expert in the politics of the region,'' <PERSON> Kimbrell </PERSON> said when asked to assess the prospects of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> winning the public acceptance for Empress II in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> that eluded it in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. `` However, they wo n't have any better legal atmosphere because they're still going to have to comply with what is a federal law, the National Environmental Policy Act,'' he said.

 Friends and colleagues, some in tears, streamed into the downtown <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> office of Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> on Sunday morning as news spread that wreckage of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressman's plane was discovered in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said there were no survivors. `` This is a very difficult time for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. We have lost one of our most important leaders, and I've lost a very good friend,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, his voice breaking. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Democrat, was among the first to arrive at the office after word came that supporters' hopes that <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and his entourage had somehow survived since Monday had proven futile. `` I know our prayers and thoughts are with his family, his wife, their young son, and soon-to-be new baby,'' <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was a very special person. I will miss him very much.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, was in seclusion Sunday morning at their <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> home and planned to make a statement later in the day, a spokesman said. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> staff members were closeted in his eighth-floor offices at a downtown <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> skyscraper. People could be seen hugging and crying in the office. Volunteers delivered coffee and soft drinks to aides who had kept a vigil at the office. `` It's very somber, very sad. They are still in shock,'' said <PERSON> Kippy </PERSON> <PERSON> Caraway </PERSON>, who was helping <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s staff. State Rep. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s since childhood, was in the office off and on all night, and was there when the call came in that the wreckage had been found. `` We got a call from our <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office around 6,'' <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> said, his voice wavering. `` As you can well imagine, it's pretty somber up there. A lot of people are calling in and expressing their sentiments.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, a family friend and consultant for food-lifts to <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> countries, said: `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> has made the supreme sacrifice as a humanitarian. Only good can come from him.'' `` We've lost a real leader, and real leaders in our political world are few and far between,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> consultant and friend who had been frequently at <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s office in the past week `` I guess everyone was hoping it would not come out this way,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leland </LOCATION> friend and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for attorney general. `` At a personal level, I've lost a friend. But more than that, he was an international leader, and it will be difficult if not impossible to replace him,'' <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> said.

 At 6 p.m., it was a rumor. By 8 p.m., it was a sellout. By midnight, it was a memory. The Rolling Stones commandeered a small club Saturday for a surprise start to their 1989 tour, ending their exile at a vacant girls school by rocking for 700 fans with good connections to the rumor mill who paid $ 3 apiece for an hourlong, greatest hits-dominated set. `` Thank you. Good, good, good. We've been playing for ourselves the last six weeks,'' <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> told the screaming crowd at the Stones' first <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> appearance in eight years. He was referring to the group's weeks of rehearsals at the <ORGANIZATION> Wykeham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in rural <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. While the Stones were the stars Saturday night, everybody inside <LOCATION> Toad </LOCATION>'s Place was eager to grab a bit of the spotlight with stories detailing leaks about the `` secret concert.'' A 50-ish woman came with her tuxedoed husband, who worked security at <LOCATION> Wykeham </LOCATION>; it was their first time -LRB- and probably last, she said -RRB- seeing the Stones. A friend of a friend of the Stones' masseuse provided another tip A local 21-year-old got a phone call at 6:50 p.m. Saturday from a buddy who heard the buzz near the club. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> was visiting his girlfriend, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> when a friend called. He had just seen the owner of <PERSON> Toad </PERSON>'s in a liquor store stocking up on Rebel Yell, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>' whiskey of choice, which was enough to confirm the rumor for them `` I have tickets to see them at <LOCATION> Foxboro </LOCATION> -LRB- Mass. -RRB-. I think I'll give them to the needy,'' said a suddenly benevolent Foster `` Why fight 80,000 people after you've seen'em with 300?'' Outside, the word spread: The Stones were coming. The crowd ignored the sign outside announcing the previously scheduled bill: `` Tonight. Rock Dance Party with the Cruiser. Admission $ 3.01.'' By 8 p.m., the doors were closed as latecomers sprinted down York Street in a vain effort to get in. `` It's happening, man. They're here,'' said one depressed fan. Another offered $ 20 to anyone on the guest list who could smuggle him in, but he found no takers. Still more looked for unattended doors behind the club, hoping to slip in. Eventually, several hundred people filled the quiet block near the <LOCATION> Yale </LOCATION> campus. Inside, the crowd was a mix of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chic and Ivy League prep. Yalies in sweatshirts rubbed shoulders with black-clad Manhattanites, some of whom appeared stunned by the ways of suburban club life. `` You've got to PAY for drinks?'' asked one incredulous scene-maker, his eyes growing large behind tinted shades, after picking up his rum and <ORGANIZATION> Coke </ORGANIZATION>. Why New Haven? `` It was a thank-you to <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> for the hospitality,'' explained harried Stones tour publicist <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanzman </PERSON>. The decision was made at the last minute. <PERSON> Toad </PERSON>'s co-owner <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON> said he was called Friday about the show, setting off a whirlwind 24 hours. The band played 11 songs in 56 minutes: `` Start Me Up,'' `` Bitch,'' `` Tumbling Dice,'' `` Sad, Sad, Sad'' -LRB- new album -RRB-, `` Miss You,'' `` Little Red Rooster,'' `` Honky Tonk Women,'' `` Mixed Emotions'' -LRB- new single -RRB-, `` It's Only Rock and Roll,'' `` Brown Sugar'' and `` Jumping <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flash </PERSON>.'' Two keyboardists and three background vocalists rounded out the band. `` Great. Exciting. Unbelievable. Phenomenal. The blues at its best,'' exulted <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Broughal </PERSON>, 21, one of the select first 700 of the expected 3 million fans who will see the Stones. The tour resumes in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Aug. 31. By an hour after the show, things were back to normal. Bouncers asked for two forms of ID, not required if you were on the guest list. The piped-in music was back on, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Watts </PERSON>' drum kit taken down. The block-long line outside was gone. <PERSON> Phelps </PERSON>, after the biggest night in his club's 14-year history, had just one regret. `` I never met'em. At one point, I was downstairs with'em before the show, but they were into their own thing,'' he said. `` And 10 minutes after the show, they were gone.''

 Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, never freed of his torment over a dying girl in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> years ago, was drawn again and again to the place he called `` the end of the Earth.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> `` Mickey'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a six-term <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Democrat and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, was on his fifth visit to refugee camps near the <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> border when the plane carrying his party crashed. The wreckage was found Sunday, six days after the plane vanished after taking off in bad weather from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> capital, and heading for the Fugnido refugee camp, 480 miles southwest. Although there were no immediate positive identifications of the bodies found by paramedics dropped from a helicopter, rescuers said no one could have survived the fiery crash. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> quickly expressed condolences to the 44-year-old congressman's wife as well as to the families and friends of those `` who died with him'' on what the president called a `` noble cause.'' It was in 1985 when <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> recalled standing in a refugee camp 10 months earlier and asking a relief official about a little girl `` who looked to be about 70 or 80 years old _ a skeleton of a person with a thin layer of brown skin draped on her, who had just a faint breath of life in her.'' `` While I was talking to him, she died. I can see her face right now. Every day I see her face,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said at the time. Twice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> evolved, by his own account, from a firebrand `` black activist,'' to an `` activist on behalf of humanity everywhere, whether it is in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, in any part of the world where people are desperate and hungry for the freedoms and rights they deserve as human beings.'' His deeds reflected the breadth of that concern. Just as he pressed for famine relief in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, he fought as relentlessly to feed the homeless in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He went to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to retrieve three children for their families in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Last October, he went to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where he helped negotiate the release of three political prisoners and their families. In a bid to bridge festering hostility between black and Jewish communities, he supervised for 10 years a program under which poor black kids from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> were sent to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for six weeks to learn about the Jewish culture and heritage. A Roman Catholic, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> once bicycled through <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and often cited the Talmud, the Jewish commentary on the Old Testament. `` If you save one life, you save the whole world,'' was his favorite passage. `` He's someone who cared and made a difference ... a militant man who found he could change the system more from the inside than the outside,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who served with <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> on the hunger committee and thrice joined him on trips to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. After offering that assessment of his friend, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to join the search. He was aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> helicopter that found the wreckage. When <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> moved from the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, replacing the retired Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, he almost immediately began pushing for a special committee on world hunger. Even after he recited the horrors he witnessed in a 1983 trip to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, he was opposed by people who argued yet another select committee was a waste of money, and by those who viewed it as an infringement of their own turf _ foreign relations, agriculture and appropriations. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> would n't back off. Instead, he rallied all the volunteer organizations concerned with hunger, and enlisted the help of celebrities like <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mass., lent his prestige <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> invited members of the established committees to join his unofficial caucus on hunger. Finally, in the spring of 1984, he got his committee _ and the momentum that resulted in $ 800 million for famine relief the following fiscal year. He personally convinced President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to divert a ship loaded with food to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. As a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications, he repeatedly tangled with the television networks over black representation, on and off camera, in their shows. A year before <PERSON> Diahann </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> appeared on `` Dynasty,'' he needled <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> executives about why the show did n't have any black characters <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said he learned his values from his mother, a teacher who had put herself through school working as a short-order cook. As a pharmacy student at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, he joined a volunteer group which operated free health clinics. He was drawn, too, to the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which also operated free clinics and gave breakfasts to needy black children. His political influences ranged from <PERSON> Stokely </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmichael </PERSON>, to <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, to Tanzanian President <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyerere </PERSON>, and he eventually formed his own <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Team </ORGANIZATION>, known as the Black Cats, and helped establish three health clinics in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> conservatives assailed him a radical, an image not helped during his days in the state legislature by his seven-inch Afro, a leather shoulder bag, and his dashikis _ long since replaced by three-piece business suits. `` I never considered myself to be a radical because I fought for the rights of human beings,'' he said. In 1972, in his first race for public office, he was elected to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where he championed health issues, included a generic-drug law over the stiff lobbying of the pharmaceutical lobby. When he ran for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1978, he had no Republican opposition and defeated a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate with more than 96 percent of the vote. He won re-election five times with similar ease, despite a 1988 primary challenge from <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Spates </PERSON>, who charged that <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> had lost touch with constituents while seeking national exposure as spokesman for the hungry and homeless. `` There's people I've not touched in a long time,'' he acknowledged. `` I have been on the road quite a bit.'' But he earned respect even from staunch conservatives like <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, the ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, who recently wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s `` personal diplomacy'' with Ethiopian and Sudanese officials `` opened up life-sustaining corridors in the border region between the two countries _ a peaceful -LRB- relief -RRB- supply route.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, who also served on the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, often thrust himself into the position of mediator in matters of international or inter-racial consequence. He was closer to Cuban President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> than any other member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` While I disagree with his fundamental ideology, I respect him for his intellect,'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> returned that sentiment, and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was often tapped to open avenues of communication between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. In April, the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregations </ORGANIZATION> paid special tribute to his work in uniting blacks and Jews. In the 1984 Democratic presidential primary, <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> supported former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> over the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, angering many of his black colleagues in the process. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> as one of the top four fund-raisers in his 1988 presidential campaign, and praised the `` consistent streak of humanity in <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'' during an election year trip to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> often had been mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Despite his political roots, he maintained a close relationship with the city's business establishment, and he and his wife, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, and their son, <PERSON> Jarret </PERSON>, shared a fashionable home in an upscale neighborhood. The Americans for Democratic Action called him a `` liberal hero'' early this year, and <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> relished the label despite the bashing that many fellow Democrats took over the `` L word'' in last year's presidential campaign. `` Some of use are not afraid to be called liberal and progressive, and to continue to fight for our place in the sun,'' he said. `` Eventually, we'll get there.''

<HEAD>Christians Repulse Syrian Offensive; 19 Killed in Beirut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Christian fighters on Sunday fought off a Syrian assault on a major <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> stronghold near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, and fighting in the capital killed at least 19 people and trapped scores more in burning buildings. The attack on the Souk el-Gharb garrison in the mountains overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was the first time the Syrians and their allies have tried to push into the Christian heartland since March 8, when the latest round of violence began in the civil war. `` This is a sterling victory,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, said on Voice of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> radio. `` The Syrian enemy and its surrogates have been dealt a crushing defeat.'' As <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> claimed victory, <PERSON> Druse </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> canceled a news conference at which he had been expected to announce the capture of Souk el-Gharb. Police confirmed the Christians repulsed the Syrian-led attack. About 2,100 Syrian troops, Druse militiamen and radical Palestinian guerrillas, backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers, attacked the one-time resort, which controls a network of roads twisting through the mountains of central <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A Christian army communique claimed 150 Syrians were killed in five hours of fighting. But a senior army source said 10 <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION>, 20 Druse and 20 Palestinians were confirmed killed. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused to give army casualties but said there were `` plenty.'' He said another 12 Syrians were killed in fighting along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, which divides the city into Christian and Moslem sectors. There was no word from the Syrians, who rarely announce their losses. The fall of Souk el-Gharb would have been a major setback for the Christians. Its loss would leave the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> suburbs of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION>, where the bulk of Christian forces and armor are deployed, vulnerable to attack. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> lives in a bunker under the shell-blasted presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>. His senior aides are based in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> compound in <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> warned that with the attack on Souk el-Gharb, the Syrians were expected to escalate their `` barbaric bombardment'' of the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said at least 19 people were killed and 80 wounded in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a virtual ghost town since the bulk of its 1.5 million residents began fleeing the fighting. `` Where are our Arab brethren?'' screamed an announcer over the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> radio. `` <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is being wiped off the face of earth as if by an earthquake. Our wounded are bleeding to death in the streets and in basements,'' she said, her voice choking with emotion. `` It's World War III here,'' cab drvier <PERSON> Bashir </PERSON> <PERSON> Harakeh </PERSON> said in a telephone call from a shelter in Moslem Bourj el-Barajneh. The casualty count Sunday did not include dozens of civilians buried in shell-wrecked apartment blocks or trapped in basements of burning buildings. Even if firefighters could get past the rubble to reach the buildings, they could not put out the flames because the city's water pumping system was destroyed three weeks ago Many people lay bleeding in the streets, because rescue teams could not reach them. Since the duels began March 8, 641 people have been killed and 1,713 wounded. That does not include casualties from the Souk el-Gharb battle or the Syrian deaths reported along the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>. The duels began after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal militia-run ports, which reportedly were costing the government $ 1 million a year in lost customs dues. The Syrians retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave. Police said about 400 Syrian guns and multi-barrelled rocket launchers began blasting the Christian heartland at dusk Saturday in one of the most intense bombardments since March. The barrage continued through Sunday. The Syrians used Soviet-designed BM-21 rocket launchers, which can fire 40 projectiles a minute, as well as 180mm and 240mm mortars. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners hit back with an estimated 25,000 rounds of 130mm mortar and 155mm howitzer fire against Syrian artillery positions along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s beaches, police said. They also blasted Syrian supply routes through the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> in east <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Three shells hit the Turkish Embassy in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, causing damage but no casualties. French Ambassador <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ala </PERSON>'s residence in <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION> was damaged, police said. The Hotel Dieu Hospital in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Barbir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> were hit, but patients and staff had taken shelter in underground bunkers. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> appealed for a cease-fire, claiming the number of casualties was `` increasing hour by hour.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> have appealed for a cease-fire. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> dispatched envoys to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> capitals, including <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, seeking diplomatic action. The Syrians have 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> maintains they betrayed that mandate when they sided the Moslems in the war. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who has vowed to drive the Syrians out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Defiance Campaign to Widen as Government Reels From Power Struggle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the government distracted by a damaging leadership struggle, anti-apartheid activists said Sunday the next phases of their nationwide defiance campaign wil include challenges to segregation of beaches and schools. The defiance campaign, launched Aug. 2 when blacks and <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> peacefully sought treatment at segregated white hospitals, has been condemned by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government as an attempt to provoke confrontation and violence. Since Friday, however, top government officials have been preoccupied by a dispute between President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and is expected to succeed <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, 73, brought the long-running rift into the open when he announced Friday he had not been consulted about de Klerk's planned meeting on Aug. 28 with Zambian President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, a prominent critic of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racial policies. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> conferred with his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> colleagues on Saturday and reportedly obtained full backing from them heading into a formal Cabinet meeting with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> on Monday. Political writers said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was likely to demand that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> stop interfering in government affairs pending his retirement next month. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> could accept the ultimatum, quit immediately, or try to fire de Klerk and other ministers, newspapers suggested. In any case, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has said he and <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> will keep their appointment with <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>. The Sunday Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> described <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as `` an unguided missile trying to inflict maximum damage before the September elections'' and warned in an editorial that his `` childish rage'' could jeopardize important diplomatic initiatives. City Press, the country's largest-selling newspaper for blacks, headlined its lead editorial Sunday: `` In the name of God, P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, please go!'' Groups affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition organizing the protests, said they planned to defy beach segregation laws in the port city of <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and demand integration of `` whites-only'' schools in racially mixed inner-city neighborhoods. Organizers were quoted by the City Press and other papers as saying they did not want to reveal too many details at this stage, but they said a mass rally was planned for next Sunday at one of the remaining whites-only beaches in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>. Plans also were announced for a meeting Thursday in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> to launch a campaign called `` All schools for all people'' to protest segregation of government schools. The Sunday Star said blacks living in central <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> will be encouraged to take their children to under-utilized white schools near their homes. Several inner-city neighborhoods have became racially mixed in recent years as the government eased enforcement of residential segregation laws. But black children in these areas must travel long distances to outlying black townships if they wish to attend public schools. In another development, 11 white policemen were scheduled to appear in court Monday to face armed robbery charges after they allegedly robbed black entrepreneurs in several townships near <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Police have released only a few details about the case and said that `` senstive'' investigations were continuing following the arrests last week. Local press reports said the suspects, all in their 20s, had targeted the owners of licensed and unlicensed taverns in the townships and had stolen at least $ 40,000 over a four-month period. The constables reportedly told their victims they were members of the White Wolves, a name which has surfaced in recent months in connection with acts of terror by white right-wing extremists. Police officials have insisted there is no evidence the White Wolves actually exists.

<HEAD>Nicaraguan Government and Contras Disagree Over Arms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nicaraguan government and the Contras disagree on a key issue of the new Central American peace proposal, with a rebel spokesman saying Sunday the combatants would return to their homeland carrying their guns. `` Our men are going to go into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> armed,'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a leader of the Nicaraguan Resistance said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Alejandro </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON>, a Nicaraguan foreign ministry official and also a guest on the show, said: `` They do n't need guns at this point.'' The presidents of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> signed an agreement Aug. 7 calling for the demobilization and disbanding of the Contra rebels by early December. The Contras, backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1981, have been fighting to oust the leftist Sandinista government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The plan does not mention the mechanics for disarming the rebels. It calls for an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> to aid the Contras in resettling in their homeland or a third country. The Honduran government, which hosts the majority of more than 10,000 combatants, has said the rebels must leave their base camps near the Nicaraguan border. <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> cited his distrust for the Sandinista government and a March 1988 bilateral agreement for saying the rebels who return to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> should carry their weapons, largely supplied by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The 1988 accord, which never was put into place because of disagreements, would have allowed the Contra combatants to hold on to their arms in special zones set up inside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` We have to realize the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> have lied, deceived, broken promises all along,'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> said: `` The Contras can come back in. There is an amnesty in place. ... The point is they do n't need guns at this point.'' Asked about <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON>'s assurances, <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> smiled, saying: `` It's a lie,'' and he called for the demobilization of the Sandinista army, which stands at about 80,000-strong and is the largest in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` Contra commanders who are living in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> condominiums really do n't command that much respect from Contra foot soldiers,'' <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> said. `` Why should any standing, legal government want to demobilize its force to protect itself?'' he said when pushed on the demobilization question. `` Once the war is over we want to go back to normalcy.'' <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> said the agreement by the Central American presidents was a disappointment. `` We feel that we've been let down by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and by the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents who should know better,'' he said, adding the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` could have lobbied harder, they could have shown more support so that our forces would remain in place until after the elections as the only guarantee for free elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The Nicaraguan government has scheduled general elections for February. <PERSON> Bendana </PERSON> said his government would `` use every political, legal, and moral means at our disposal to try to persuade these people to come in within the civic, within the legal arena.'' `` Let's slug it out on the radio stations and the newspapers, openly, in political rallies, by way of political platforms put before the <LOCATION> Nicaraguan </LOCATION> people so the Nicaraguan people and not the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and not at the point of a gun, can decide what kind of government they want on February 25th, under international observation,'' the Nicaraguan official added. Some 50,000 Nicaraguans, many of them civilians, have been killed in the fighting in the rural northern mountains and central plains.

 The army's chief spokesman said Sunday he refuses to accept that two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers taken captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> were killed, despite a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> news report that they have been dead more than three years. `` My consideration is that they are alive and we must do our utmost to bring them home,'' Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON> told a news conference. He refused to confirm or deny the report in the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> investigators who questioned a kidnapped Moslem Shiite clergyman have concluded the two Israeli soldiers are dead. ` We consider our prisoners of war ... as living until positive evidence proves the contrary,'' <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have offered to trade the cleric and hundreds of other Moslem Shiite prisoners held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for the two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> infantrymen, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> airman, and the 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Lebanese Shiite leaders have called for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to first release its prisoners and let <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> deportees return to the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lapid </PERSON>'s news conference was called after the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper report gained widespread attention in the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> media. The British weekly quoted unidentified security sources in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as saying Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has tried to keep the two deaths a secret from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to avoid pressure to free the cleric in exchange only for Western hostages. Israeli commandos on July 28 abducted the radical Shiite cleric, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says he is a leader of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> militia, which is believed to be an umbrella for groups holding Western hostages. The Sunday Times quoted unidentified senior Israeli government sources as saying <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s interrogators believe the infantrymen, <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rahamim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsheik </PERSON>, died of wounds within hours after their car was ambushed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in February 1986. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> weekly said the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> airman, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, who was shot down in October 1986, is believed to be alive and held by a <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> militia with closer ties to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Walesa to Meet Kiszczak, May Be Prime Minister Candidate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Sunday he plans to meet communist Prime Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> in the near future, and a Solidarity official said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> might himself be willing to head <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s next government. In comments relayed by an aide in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, `` I do not want to, nor should I be prime minister. I have my own candidates.'' But Senator <PERSON> Jaroslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaczynski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s envoy in talks with two minor parties on formation of a Solidarity-led coalition government, said Sunday of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, `` it is true he is considering'' becoming prime minister. The opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> had raised the possibility of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s becoming prime minister last week, and another Solidarity lawmaker, Senator <PERSON> Aleksander </PERSON> <PERSON> Paszynski </PERSON>, said it was raised in talks with the other parties. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> left his home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> Sunday afternoon for <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, where on Monday he was expected to take part in coalition talks with political leaders of the other parties in parliament. Replying to the appeal of newly elected Prime Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, who announced Saturday he wanted to meet <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> `` as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he too wants such a meeting. `` I will meet with Gen. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> in the nearest future ... We can not avoid difficult topics,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said, according to the aide. <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> was elected prime minister Aug. 2, but his efforts to form a government ran into trouble four days later when <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> announced he would oppose any government formed by the longtime interior minister. Solidarity senator <PERSON> Kaczynski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> authorized him to conduct talks with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Peasants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, two small parties that hold the balance of power in the parliament because Solidarity and the communists each have less than 50 percent of the seats. The talks that began Thursday continued through the weekend at an undisclosed site, <PERSON> Kaczynski </PERSON> said, speaking by telephone from his home in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` They are conducted amid different difficulties with good will on all three sides,'' he said. The Democrats and the Peasants were leaning toward the idea of a coalition with Solidarity, he said, but that there was no way to say where those talks would lead. Peasant Party deputies have said voters reacted badly to the choice of <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> as prime minister, the election of Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to the new post of president and the selection of former prime minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> as the new head of the communist party. The reshuffle at the top leaves the impression among voters that nothing has changed despite Solidarity's victory at the polls in June, when union-backed candidates swept all 161 seats open to the opposition in the 460-member <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> and 99 of 100 seats in the newly created <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` If one recognizes that these elections were really won by the opposition, then it should be ready to take over the government,'' said Solidarity member <PERSON> Paszynski </PERSON> in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was a `` logical'' candidate for prime minister, even though he is not an expert on the economy, he said. The political stalemate at the top echelons of power and growing frustration over steep price hikes Aug. 1 and soaring inflation has frustrated Poles, prompting a number of work stoppages in protest over economic chaos. Solidarity says the new government must have public support in order to be able to rule _ backing that a communist-led coalition will be unable to achieve. Communist leaders have repeatedly urged Solidarity to join a so-called `` grand coalition'' in which the opposition would be offered several ministries, but Solidarity has declined, saying that option would change nothing. But the prospect of a non-communist led government appears to have disconcerted <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s main <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally. A Soviet Foreign Ministry official in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday criticized attempts to use the formation of the Polish government `` for destabilizing the sitution in the country,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency.

<TEXT>
 Drug users, rather than failed government policies, are to blame for the spread of drugs throughout society, drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Sunday. He also defended the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's efforts to combat drugs, including former First Lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Just Say No'' campaign. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> by law must forward a new national strategy for fighting drugs to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by Sept. 5. It is expected to call for a major boost in federal spending and emphasize both tougher penalties for individual drug use and mandatory treatment for addicts. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was asked on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Face the Nation'' if his approach marks a reversal from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policy, which cut funds for treatment and emphasized drug interdiction and arrests of kingpins. The $ 21 billion spent fighting drugs during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` was n't wasted, and it was n't all wrong. ... `` said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` There were some real successes during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. `` I do n't think anyone can deny that drugs are pervasive throughout much of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, but recent statistics indicate that casual drug use is down. `` Although some people like to criticize the educational efforts and the first lady's efforts, they obviously have had some effect,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s education secretary published a booklet on how to keep drugs out of schools. `` We are shifting strategy, but let's remember we have not had the opportunity before to have a comprehensive look,'' said <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` The government may not have been as effective ... -LRB- or -RRB- as smart as it should have been. ... But it's the people who are taking drugs that are causing these tragedies, not the government,'' he said. Asked if he would recommend raising taxes for the drug fight, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> replied, `` Do n't think we need taxes.'' But he insisted, `` The money will be there. We will put our cards on the table. We will suggest what we want to do and we will propose spending more money. Then we will see what the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to do. `` It means making some difficult choices,'' he said. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, citing reports of bootleg sales of methadone by addicts to buy crack, said drug treatment programs need `` much more accountability.'' Without it, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> warned, `` at some point the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will say, ` The heck with it.' `` The more I've seen of -LRB- treatment -RRB-, the more impressed I am by the need for efforts in prevention. It's terrible to get into this business, it's very hard to get out of it,'' he said. He scoffed at the notion that research can find a way to end people's cravings for drugs. `` We're not going to uncover anything in a laboratory that ... we can put in a pill and give it to somebody and they're not going to want drugs anymore,'' said the onetime philosophy professor. And despite five months of `` conscientious'' study of the issues, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said he has found `` no magic bullet.'' His recommendations wo n't be like `` Batman -LRB- coming -RRB- through the transom saying, ` Here it is, and it's over,''' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said.

 Two Sinhalese radicals assassinated a prominent broadcaster in his home near the capital Sunday during ethnic violence that also killed 38 other people across the country, officials said. <PERSON> Kulasiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaratunga </PERSON>, the 62-year-old chief news editor of state television, was shot in the neck, according to military officials. Before escaping on bicycles, the assassins cut telephone lines at the house in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lavinia </LOCATION>, a seaside resort six miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the officials said. They blamed the killing on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Sinhalese group accused of killing two other broadcast personalities last month as part of a campaign against the Sinhalese-dominated government. All three victims were members of the majority Sinhalese ethnic group. The militants believe the government and supporters they have targeted are too soft on minority Tamil rebels, who are fighting for an independent homeland. Military officials also blamed the front for eight killings in central <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. They said the victims were fatally shot Saturday in <LOCATION> Laggala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 65 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The bodies were hanged from trees and cement posts in the village, the officials said. They said the victims were identified as five local politicians, two government officials and a school principal. Officials said ethnic violence since Saturday also claimed 30 other lives across <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Police officials said 14 villagers of <LOCATION> Embilipitiya </LOCATION>, 80 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, were shot and killed by unidentified attackers. Military officials said Sinhalese gunmen shot and killed two <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks and one of their students Saturday night in their temple at <LOCATION> Yakkala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, about 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Sri Lankan troops shot and killed six civilians who did not stop at government checkpoints in different places across the country, officials said. Sinhalese radicals fired at a police patrol in the <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION> area, 70 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, killing an inspector and injuring two constables on Saturday, officials also said. In addition, four unidentified bodies were found in central and southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since Saturday, officials said. They also said two Tamil rebels were shot to death by Indian peacekeeping troops in the northeastern <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> district. During the six-year Tamil insurgency, about 15,000 people have died in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic violence. About 11,000 died in the Tamil insurrection, and the remaining died in the Sinhalese backlash. Tamils make up 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people. Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the population. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in this nation's ethnic problems because of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.

 Depression can hamper a woman's mothering abilities by hindering her relationship with her infant, according to a study aimed at keeping such infants from developing their own problems. Researchers found depressed mothers to be less attentive to their children and less emotionally engaged with them than non-depressed mothers, said study co-author <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON>. One depressed mother even failed to notice that her baby had fallen off her own lap, said <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON>, head of the psychology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>. She spoke in an interview before presenting her work Sunday at the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The study was done with <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Teti </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> campus The depressed mothers did not have simply occasional periods of low spirits that everyone feels. Instead, they had long-lasting depression that had persisted for an average of a year when they entered the study. Previous studies have found that infants of such chronically depressed mothers are at risk for problems such as excessive crying and other poor control over emotional behavior, <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON> said. In later childhood, they may have trouble getting along with peers and teachers and lag in school achievement, she said. It is not clear whether such problems stem from the mother's depression earlier in the child's life, or her depression at the time the problems manifested themselves, or a combination of both, she said The study included 37 depressed mothers and 37 non-depressed mothers. The two groups were matched for socioeconomic and marital status, and age of the child. The infants were three months to 12 months old at the beginning of the study, which has gone on about a year so far. Mothers were studied in their homes by observers who had not been told which women were depressed, a precaution to avoid biasing their appraisals. The mothers were observed while they fed their babies, played with them and filled out a questionnaire. In all three situations, depressed women tended to be less sensitive to their infants' needs than the non-depressed mothers, and they failed to pick up cues from their children as well as the other mothers did, <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON> said. They were also less emotionally engaged with their children and less attentive, she said. Depressed mothers were also more likely to perceive their children more negatively than the non-depressed mothers viewed their own children. For example, they rated their children as less intellectually capable and less rewarding, <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON> said. In addition, `` they see themselves as inadequate mothers'' in such tasks as feeding, bathing, dressing and teaching, <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON> said. `` The depressed mothers just view parenthood as extremely demanding, almost more demanding than they can bear,'' she said. Researchers have started to look at the children as they reach ages 1 and older, and found the offspring of depressed mothers to be less responsive to the mother, less interested in her and less emotionally attached. They also seemed to be generally less happy, <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON> said. Researchers are testing a program to prevent infants' problems that can result from a mother's depression. The program includes weekly visits by a nurse to stimulate the mother's interest in her baby. Later, to counter a tendency to become housebound, depressed mothers are encouraged to become active outside the home. Too few women have completed the program yet to provide a good estimate of its effectiveness, <PERSON> Gelfand </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehm </PERSON>, professor of psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION>, said the study's findings on the effects of a mother's depression generally agree with previous research.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will close its embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Monday because the staff's ability to assist hundreds of East German refugees seeking exit visas to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> is `` totally exhausted.'' Refugees have been holed up nearly two weeks at the <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> embassy, as well as in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s missions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> Wunderlich </PERSON>, who made the announcement Sunday, refused to say how many East Germans were at the <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> embassy. News reports last week estimated 300 were in the embassy and said more were arriving each day. Many traveled to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and were caught trying to escape to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> removed barriers along its Western border. `` The reception capacity for East German asylum seekers at the representation in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> is totally exhausted,'' the ministry said in a statement delivered to news agencies. `` The embassy must therefore be closed for the time being, beginning Monday, Aug. 14.'' The embassy will be closed to the public, and the refugees already there will be asked to leave and informed again that only <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> can grant them exit visas, officials at the ministry said. <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> closed its <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission on Tuesday after 131 East Germans sought refuge there, and officials have said it will not be reopened until normal diplomatic operations can be resumed. <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grashoff </PERSON>, spokesman for the mission, said 10 of the East Germans voluntarily left the facility Sunday but that the others were still camped on the protected mission grounds. The West German mission in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, where about 20 East Germans are thought to have taken refuge, will remain open for the time being. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership has said it will not punish those who sought refuge in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> authorities have told the East Germans they need permission from their government to leave for the West. The refugee situation in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> developed this summer after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> dismantled the barriers on its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. At least 1,500 East Germans are estimated to have escaped to the West through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> since May. Most of those at the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> are East Germans who were allowed to travel to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, then attempted to escape to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and were caught by Hungarian border guards. The Hungarians have in some cases noted the failed escape attempt in the passports of the East Germans. Out of fear that they would be punished back home, the East Germans have sought <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s protection. East Germans can obtain permission to travel to neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact ally, with relative ease, but applicants for emigration visas often must wait years for an answer. A Hamburg-based newspaper, The World on Sunday, said the West German intelligence service has determined that 1.5 million East Germans want to emigrate to the West, or nearly 10 percent of the 16 million population. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> expects about 100,000 East Germans to make their way to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by the end of the year, through legal emigration and escapes. The recent increase in escape attempts is believed to be grounded in an increasing sense of hopelessness among East Germans. Neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have followed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s lead and adopted market-oriented economic reforms and broadened personal freedoms But East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has shown no inclination to do so. In a commentary on the eve of Sunday's 28th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall's construction, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neues </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deutschland </ORGANIZATION> accused the West of trying to `` economically plunder and destabilize <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s decision to force students who planned to start graduate school to work first appears an effort to combat youthful idealism with exposure to the real-life complexities of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political, social and economic problems. The announcement Saturday was reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution of the 1966-76, when virtually all Chinese college students were sent to work on farms to learn working-class attitudes. The new order, issued by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and announced in the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, said only that the goal of the program was to `` increase the percentage of graduate students with practical work experience.'' It said the order was aimed at `` especially those in the social sciences.'' The social sciences are perceived as the most dangerous field of study because they expose students to alternate political and economic theories. Some fields, like sociology, were banned altogether for many years under <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule. The government order that students work for one or two years first did not say what kind of jobs they would be given or exactly how many would be affected. It said students with prior work experience _ about half of the originally planned incoming graduate class of 35,000 _ would be exempt. Last week, education authorities denied Western reports that all college graduates assigned to government jobs will be required to spend a year working `` at the grassroots'' in small cities or rural areas. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, contacted by telephone, said a 6-year-old order had indeed required students assigned to jobs in provincial government and higher levels to do so. However, he said few students were actually sent to such assignments. The government already has cut the number of incoming college freshmen nationwide by 30,000 to 610,000 students in an apparent effort to curb student unrest. Many college students who graduated in June already have begun their government-assigned jobs, including those assigned to provincial governments or the central government. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s education system has a history of combining study with assigned work for the purpose of political indoctrination. Even after the Cultural Revolution, middle school and college students have often been required to spend several weeks each summer in social service.

 Searchers on Sunday found the wreckage of Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s plane scattered on a rugged mountainside in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, six days after it disappeared. All 16 people aboard were believed dead. The plane crashed near the town of <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION> about 100 miles northwest of a refugee camp where it was bound, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials said. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was on tour in his capacity as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the embassy in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said 12 bodies were initially found at the site 300 miles southwest of the capital. An earlier report said 13 bodies had been found. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said all others aboard were believed dead. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said the wreckage was found in terrain so rugged that medical teams had to be lowered initially from helicopters. He said helicopters were able to set down no closer than a half mile away. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> searchers confirmed there were no survivors at the site. Pentagon spokesman <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloyer </PERSON> said the plane had `` basically disintegrated.'' He said the condition of the wreckage had made the body count difficult. He quoted reports from the scene that said the plane, which lay in a ravine, had burned after the crash. `` It was pretty awesome, unsurvivable,'' said the pilot of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 plane that flew over the site, a steep slope 4,300 feet up a 5,500-foot mountain. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Searchers had no immediate report of what caused the crash. Officials did not explicitly say when the aircraft went down, but it was believed to have crashed Aug. 7 on the same day it left the capital for the refugee camp. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed sadness over the deaths. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and the other members of his traveling party, both Americans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the hungry,'' he said in a statement from the White House. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s party consisted of eight other Americans, including two <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> staff members; one aide to Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-California; a friend of the congressman; three officers of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>; and the wife of one of the AID officials. The other seven aboard were all Ethiopian: a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy employee, three government officials and a crew of three. The chartered Twin Otter plane disappeared en route to the Fugnido refugee camp near the Sudanese border, one of four in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees. Fugnido is home to more than 300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and civil war in their own country. <PERSON> Gambela </PERSON> and the village of <LOCATION> Dembidola </LOCATION> just to the north had been an early focus of the search because there are two dirt airstrips in the area. Officials believe the pilot of the twin-engine plane might have diverted to one of those strips because of heavy clouds and low visibility at <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s destination. The Ethiopian government said peasants heard a light plane circling near dirt strips about 90 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION> on Aug. 7. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, friends and colleagues of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> streamed into his downtown office as news spread that the wreckage had been discovered. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, also a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Democrat, said with a breaking voice, `` This is a very difficult time for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. We have lost one of our most important leaders, and I've lost a very good friend.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> early on Aug. 7 and boarded the Twin Otter with his party several hours later. Bad weather delayed takeoff for two hours, and officials said conditions were marginal for flying when they finally set off from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bole </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. By the time it was learned that they had not reached their destination, it was getting dark. Bad weather made it impossible to mount a search until Tuesday. The wreckage was first sighted by the crew of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> MH-60 Blackhawk helicopter carrying Rep. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, one of two colleagues of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> who came to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> to take part in the search, officials said. <PERSON> Haley </PERSON> said other American and Ethiopian helicopters and at least one Soviet chopper were sent to the scene. He said the helicopter crews and medical evacuation personnel would spend the night in <LOCATION> Gambela </LOCATION>, a town about 50 miles from the Sudanese border, and recovery of the bodies would begin Monday. The search effort grew steadily through the week. More than 10 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> planes, including a high-altitude U-2 reconnaisance craft, were eventually committed to the effort. The Ethiopian air force and <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> added an equal number of aircraft, despite cool relations that have existed between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Marxist government of this East African nation since 1974. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s help in the search was bound to help improve relations.

<TEXT>
 West Germans vandalized the Berlin Wall, an official called for its removal, and an East German tried to escape to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Sunday, the 28th anniversary of the day construction began on the infamous barrier. Security forces also dispersed about 50 East Germans who tried to demonstrate in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in front of the West German mission, which was closed last week after a crowd of East Germans arrived seeking refuge. Witnesses said the demonstrators tried to lay flowers at the mission gates in an apparent act of solidarity with their countrymen holed up inside demanding exit visas to the West. No protesters were arrested. <PERSON> Dorothee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON>, the West German minister for inter-German affairs, criticized <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s effort `` to build up and perfect the inhumane barriers'' between East and West. Her deputy chief, <PERSON> Ottfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennig </PERSON>, predicted the wall would be taken down by the end of the century. An unidentified assailant hurled a firebomb at the wall near the Brandenburg Gate early Sunday, West German police said. The bomb exploded when it crashed against the wall, but it burned out without causing serious damage. The East German state news agency, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, said several masked assailants from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> damaged border barriers in the southern sector of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. ADN, which did not describe the damage, said a diplomatic protest would be lodged with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> authorities. Witnesses at the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> reported Sunday that at least one man attempted to flee across the heavily guarded crossing just before noon. He was arrested by East German border guards before reaching Western territory, the witnesses said. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, 200 people gathered at downtown Voeroesmarty Square to protest the wall. The speakers, who included young East German tourists, called for its demolition. Several displayed placards with slogans proclaiming, `` Make Love, Not Wall,'' and `` We Have No Need of Any Control.'' No violence was reported during the 40-minute demonstration. The August 13th Society, a human rights organization that monitors East European refugee affairs, estimates that at least 40,000 East Germans have escaped across the borders with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since the wall was erected. Prior to 1961, hundreds of thousands of East Germans fled to the West, draining the Communist state of many of its top scientists, artists and intellectuals. The number of escapes surged over the last few months after <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> began dismantling its border barriers with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. East Germans can usually obtain permission to travel to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a neighboring Communist ally, and an estimated 1,500 of them have illegally crossed from there into <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> this summer. Several hundred East Germans have recently sought refuge at West German embassies, which has prompted <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to close its embassy in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and its mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Saturday defended the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and said hopes for its removal are `` illusory.'' <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON>, the newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said the wall is `` a step toward peace'' and that it will remain in place to prevent East Germans from fleeing to the West.

<HEAD>New Junta Announces Economic Reform Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s new military leaders on Sunday announced an economic reform program that includes a 20 percent cut in government spending and possible decreases in government subsidies of consumer goods. Col. <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Din </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Karrar </PERSON>, a member of the 15-member council in charge of the economy, said in an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that he was optimistic <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> would be able to reach a loan agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> soon. Improving <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s faltering economy, which is burdened by a $ 13 billion foreign debt and an exhausting civil war in the south, has been one of the main targets of the new regime, which took power in a military coup June 30. <PERSON> Karrar </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> had ordered government units to cut spending by 20 percent, but he did not specify how much money that would save. One of the junta's first acts was to cut the Cabinet from 30 to 22 ministers. <PERSON> Karrar </PERSON> also said that government subsidies to some of the main consumer goods would be `` reconsidered,'' but he did not say which commodities would be affected. The ousted elected government of <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> had budgeted $ 183 million for subsidies this fiscal year. <PERSON> Karrar </PERSON> said he was optimistic <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> would reach agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> next month without affecting the welfare of Sudanese people. He gave no details. In February 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> declared <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> ineligible for further loans for defaulting on debt payments. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic assistance was halted in January because the <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION> government was late in paying off loans.

<HEAD>Investigators Wonder If Crack Smoke Killed 10 Infants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Medical examiners in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> are trying to determine whether 10 infants died over the last three years as a result of inhaling secondhand crack smoke from adults. The 10 all had chemical evidence of cocaine in their blood. The coroner, <PERSON> Haresh </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON>, came up with the theory after the April 6 death of a 10-month-old girl named <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON>. Testing showed there was cocaine in the her blood, some of which had gotten there the night before her death. <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON> said the baby died after apparently inhaling smoke from crack, a highly addictive form of cocaine, generated by her mother and other adults in the house. The deaths of <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON> and nine other babies might show, according to the medical examiner's theory, that children are highly susceptible to serious illness and death from breathing in crack smoke when the drug is smoked by adults around them. <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON> stressed last week that more research was needed before his theory could be proven. <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON>'s study involved the cases of six girls and four boys _ ranging in age from 28 days to 10 months _ who died in the city in the last three years. Each infant had either cocaine or its chemical residue in their blood, tissue, or organs, the study found. Several babies had parents, siblings, or baby sitters who used crack. Several slept in small, poorly ventilated rooms in crowded row houses. In some instances, police or residents said they saw lingering clouds of crack smoke or discarded crack vials in the homes, according to the investigation. <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON> said the investigation started the day after <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON>'s death He refused to provide the full names or addresses of the infants or their relatives. An autopsy performed on <PERSON> Tasha </PERSON>'s body revealed small amounts of active cocaine as well as the drug's residue. <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON> determined that the presence of the active cocaine, which is usually broken down by the body in two hours, showed the baby had been exposed to it shortly before she died _ `` only a few hours before death,'' <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON> said. The residue indicated exposure to the drug of a long-term nature, he said. <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON> visited the baby's 22-year-old mother May 1. `` She admitted being a crack addict,'' he said. She `` said she used cocaine before and during the pregnancy.'' <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON> said the mother was not breast-feeding the child. She had not put the drug in the child's food or milk, and there was no sign the child could have found the drug lying around and eaten it. Recent studies of the dangers of the passive inhalation of cigarette smoke led <PERSON> Mirchandani </PERSON> to the possibility that the same was true of the passive inhalation of crack smoke. He said even though the mother `` said she did n't smoke around the baby,'' the child's room was not well-ventilated and other adults addicted to the drug smoked it in the house. Similar cases in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> supported the doctor's theory, he said. `` Cocaine can be toxic at any dose, and is proven to be dangerous and deadly in even small doses ... even in adults,'' he said. `` I would expect a much heightened toxicity for infants. It's common sense Something that is toxic for adults ... would be even more toxic for an infant.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> is a month or more away from completing a study of thousands of documents, videotapes and other possessions of a former law student called a suspect in the killings of 40 young women. `` There's more of it here than even I thought there was,'' Capt. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> task force, said of the material seized from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 38. Asked if police had found anything to connect <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> with any of the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> replied, `` Not yet.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> denies he is the killer. `` People should know the fact that I have never hurt anyone in my life,'' he said in a statement released earlier through his attorney. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has not been charged with any violent crimes, including the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings, a series of slayings from 1982 to 1984, mostly of prostitutes in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. The case takes its name from the stream south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> river where the bodies of the first victims were found. Police have blamed the deaths of 40 young women and the disappearance of eight others on the serial killer. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is in the King County Jail, serving a one-year sentence for a 1979 burglary and additional time for escape. He's due to be released Sept. 25, but <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said he doubts the 12-member task force will be finished by then with analyzing the thousands of items in 55 boxes and bags taken in a July 12 search of the home of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' parents and a rental house <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> used as a student in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. Police would have no hold on <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> after Sept. 25, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` We're still going through the paperwork and expect to be doing that for another month or so,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` There's been nothing so far to diminish our interest or to indicate we should feel any more strongly about him.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> walked away from a work-release program in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in 1981, and was n't apprehended until January of this year, when it was learned he was living at his parents' home in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> and attending <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Among the possessions seized by the task force were police badges and paraphernalia. Investigators have suspected the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer could be a police officer or someone posing as one. In an affidavit filed to support a search warrant in the case, some people who knew <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he liked pornography, frequented prostitutes and carried photographs of mutilated women. Among items seized in the search were 1,800 videotapes. A sample of the videotapes show they `` ranged from TV shows to hard-core pornography,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. He said he will have the task force look at all the tapes `` only if I have to. I do n't want to, but if necessary, I will do that.'' Besides the tapes, the material includes massive amounts of paperwork, much of it receipts and personal documents. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said detectives have followed up much of their reading with interviews, but he had no estimate of the number conducted. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said investigators are seeking both possible links to the killings and alibis for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. `` We're working very, very hard to prove that he's someone not of interest to us,'' he said. Detectives are looking at people other than <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> declined to say whom. `` There always have been other people we have been checking out and there will be until there are no leads to follow.''

<HEAD>Virginia Firm Took Fees From HUD Projects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> consulting firm collected huge fees through a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> program, including $ 1.5 million for one project, according to a published report. And that project was approved by a senior official in March on his last workday at the agency after he waived numerous <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regulations, The Sun reported Sunday. The consulting fees appear to be the largest yet uncovered in programs operated by the troubled federal housing agency, which has been rocked by disclosures of favoritism and irregularities in many programs. The Sun reported that Land Development Financing, led by <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mimna </PERSON> and his associate, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mooney </PERSON>, stood to gain up to $ 4.9 million in consulting fees on projects under the Title X land development program until <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> announced that he was halting the program in late June. Under Title X, a developer acquires land, builds roads and installs utilities on parcels of land that are then sold to builders who construct houses and apartments. If a project fails _ and about half of all Title X projects have, according to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials _ <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> pays the mortgage lender the balance due on the loan. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said he would end the program because it was costly to taxpayers and had not helped provide adequate housing for the poor. The largest Title X loan ever approved by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 78.2 million, was granted March 3 to <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> Farms, a proposed development in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mimna </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> LDF </ORGANIZATION> received a $ 1.5 million consulting fee for obtaining the HUD-backed mortgage, the newspaper reported The loan was approved by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nistler </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for single-family housing, on his last day at the agency. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> documents indicate that <PERSON> Nistler </PERSON> intervened personally in the processing of the application, issuing a series of directives to expedite the project and waive regular <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> procedures. <PERSON> Mimna </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, said his brother left the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> area several months ago and that he did not know how to reach him. The documents reveal numerous apparent deviations from normal <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> procedures in the handling of McNair Farms. _ Normally, independent cost figures computed by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> staff are used to determine how much a mortgage should be But in the case of <ORGANIZATION> McNair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION>, the developer's own cost figures were used. _ The mortgage amount approved was $ 2 million more than the costs _ A full environmental impact statement was not done, despite environmental concerns about wetlands and flood plains on the property _ Some of the mortgage proceeds were permitted to be used to pay off debts on land that was not covered by the Title X loan _ Detailed working drawings and specifications, normally required before approval, were not submitted According to the documents, the project was approved after numerous meetings involving Nistler, <PERSON> Mimna </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON>, whose husband, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, was briefly a special assistant to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON> also was a top adviser to Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign, and organized an inaugural gala for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouser </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> MSB </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based lending affiliate of the national brokerage firm that provided the mortgage on <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Mimna </PERSON> told him several months ago that he had made Mrs. <PERSON> Canzeri </PERSON> a partner in his consulting firm while seeking approval of the McNair project.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will consider raising taxes next year unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agrees to cut Medicare and other domestic programs, budget chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> director said he will recommend that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seek fiscal 1991 cuts in the growth of Medicare, agriculture, veterans and other entitlement programs, but not Social Security. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press,'' repeated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s resolve not to raise taxes, but said: `` When the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comes back in September, if they do n't fully implement the bipartisan budget agreement, we will have to have a sequester, and it will drive us toward having to face the tax issue the following year, which we should n't do.'' He said the administration and the legislative branch must find savings of $ 25 billion to $ 30 billion to avoid an automatic, across-the-board cut under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law. He complained that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments for doctors' fees have risen `` at about 15 percent a year. That ca n't go on forever; it's going to consume the whole budget So we have to restrain the growth there.'' `` There are going to be some wealthy doctors, presumably, who are n't quite so wealthy in the future,'' he predicted. `` I think it will be necessary to recommend additional structural reforms in the entitlement programs _ not Social Security, but in the other entitlement programs,'' said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>. He singled out Medicare, `` agricultural programs, veterans programs, and other such entitlement programs.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said he did not regard the military budget as ripe for cuts. He said it has fallen in real terms by 12 percent over the last five budgets. He defended the half-billion-dollar B-2 Stealth bomber, which he acknowledged is `` a big, pricey item.'' Nothing is more important than avoiding nuclear war, he said, `` so if it's an effective deterrent, it's well worth the investment,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> recently decried Americans' tendency to spend now and saddle later generations with the bills. `` I am sure there is more than enough blame to go around, although I would not like to have any attached to the present administration or the prior administration with which I was associated,'' said the former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> aide. He also defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> in the next century that will cost more than $ 400 billion in today's dollars over the next three decades `` It's a rather long time, we do n't have to spend it all tomorrow,'' said the budget chief. `` The key is that we start the planning so that we do n't miss this opportunity to expand human horizons,'' he said. If `` we penny-pinch everywhere at the risk of sacrificing some of the most exciting possibilities for humans in the future, that's not being responsible either.''

<HEAD>Workers Repairing Storm-Ravaged LA Aqueduct Get Break From Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLANCHA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Workers repairing the flood-damaged aqueduct that supplies millions of Southern Californians with water got a break in the weather Sunday, but expected to be on the job two more weeks. Some 30 workers using bulldozers and other heavy equipment labored under sunny skies to scoop tons of mud, rocks and other storm debris out of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aqueduct </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Inyo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> about 180 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` They're continuing right along today, making good progress,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON>. A two-mile stretch of the aqueduct was buried when a flash flood hurled tons of debris down upon it Tuesday. Then a storm Thursday buckled a 1,000-foot stretch of the aqueduct's concrete lining. The aqueduct carries water from streams in the eastern <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> range to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> communities. Two 30-person teams were each working 12-hour shifts, and repairs were expected to take two weeks, the spokeswoman said. The city, which gets 75 percent of its water from the aqueduct, was n't expected to experience shortages in the meantime, but water officials urged residents to voluntarily conserve. A series of intense, widely scattered storms deluged parts of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, Imperial, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mono </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Inyo </LOCATION> counties throughout most of last week before moving into <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. Until the aqueduct is fixed, the water department will provide <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with water by drawing supplies from reservoirs south of the broken part of the aqueduct and making extra purchases from the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Jensen </PERSON> said the damage was the worst since similar storms ravaged the aqueduct in 1968.

<HEAD>Security, `Just Say Nyet' Buttons Frown on Drinking at Heavy Metal

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet youth poured into <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to hear American heavy metal heroes Sunday but 10,000 security men and rockers with `` Just Say Nyet'' buttons kept the concert from getting too intoxicating. `` If the police were n't here, there would be drugs and drinking and making love,'' said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Rvinskaya </PERSON>, an 18-year-old <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> mother dressed in the metal bracelets and tight, short blue-jean skirt favored by her motorcycle gang. `` But what can you do with police everywhere?'' she shrugged. And they were everywhere, among the 100,000 people gathered for the second day of ear-shattering heavy metal sounds from the likes of <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jovi </LOCATION>, Scorpions and <ORGANIZATION> Ozzy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Osbourne </ORGANIZATION>. It was <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s biggest festival of foreign rock music, which for years was condemned as an infectious item of Western decadence. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> militia in blue, riot police in black, <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agents in dark civilian clothes and young toughs in uniform track suits and T-shirts lined the stage and aisles throughout the packed <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Luzhniki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. Soviet impresario <PERSON> Stas </PERSON> <PERSON> Namin </PERSON> said he and the foreign organizers of the concert had requested the overwhelming security. He said Soviet authorities have never allowed so many young people to gather in one place, and they did n't know what to expect. Authorities might be suffer extra anxiety since the crowd came dressed in chains and skin-tight leather. <PERSON> Motley </PERSON> <PERSON> Crue </PERSON> incited the crowd to scream obscenities in English, which Soviet government television broadcast nationwide in its coverage of `` fragments'' of the concert. And some fans shed their clothes for a brief streak across the stands. But mountains of vodka bottles piled up outside the stadium, and suggestions of more outrageous behavior remained onstage. It was an appropriate action for a concert billed as an anti-drug and anti-alcohol event. Many rockers wore buttons emblazoned, `` Just Say Nyet.'' The audience poured into <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> from all over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Galkin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Astrakhan </LOCATION> said he hitchhiked for 48 hours to reach the festival, and he does n't even like heavy metal. `` I would rather have heard Led <ORGANIZATION> Zeppelin </ORGANIZATION>, Dire Straits or <PERSON> Pink </PERSON> <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON>,'' he said. Hundreds of youths who could not afford the scalpers' price of up to $ 112 a ticket milled around outside the stadium. But no matter _ the music could be heard a half-mile away. Motorcycle gangs, rarely seen on the streets of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, showed off tattoos, brass knuckles and flags of the American Confederacy. They were joined by frumpy grandmothers and officials in business suits sitting stiffly in a stadium full of singing, screaming and dancing fans. Other rockers in the two-day festival, broadcast in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on pay television Sunday, were Cinderella and Skid Row from the West and Nuance and <LOCATION> Brigada </LOCATION> S from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Teen Survival Program Faces Licensing, Legal Challenges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A wilderness survival program for troubled teens is fighting for its own life after running afoul of state officials and a teen-age girl who claims she was kidnapped and abused by the program's operators. Challenger Foundation II is designed to quell rebellious behavior and build confidence in teen-agers by forcing them to confront their problems in the setting of the rugged southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> desert. During their first three days in the desert, for example, they may eat only wild plants that they pick or animals and insects that they catch. The state attorney general's office says such a program amounts to therapy, which Challenger II lacks a license to provide. In addition, a judge has ruled that Challenger operators violated the civil rights of 17-year-old <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Zasso </PERSON> of Mt. <PERSON> Kisco </PERSON>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, by abducting her from a dentist's office and forcing her into the program at her father's request. Ms. <PERSON> Zasso </PERSON> is suing the program and its operators for $ 230 million, and a big award could put the school out of business. Challenger is threatened with further legal action from the state attorney general unless the operators can demonstrate that participating teens are provided adequate food, water and clothing, as well as such necessities as toilet paper and sleeping bags. Program founder <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cartisano </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> special forces sergeant billed in ads as a `` real-life Rambo,'' has filed a countersuit charging the state with harassment. Several state officials say they will decide this week whether Challenger must obtain a license as a therapeutic care provider to continue operation. Currently, the program's counselors do n't have the training required for such a license. <PERSON> Cartisano </PERSON>, who was in southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> over the weekend, did not return telephone calls to his office in <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Zasso </PERSON>'s attorneys did n't respond to a telephone request for comment. The company's ads promise that for $ 12,500 per teen, Challenger `` stops self-destructive behavior and places parents back in control.'' Its detractors say the 63-day survival program is cruel and dangerous. In the first stage of the program, the teens drink stream water they must purify with chemicals and substitute sagebrush for toilet paper. During the two latter stages, the participants' diet included oatmeal, lentils, cheese, meat, raisins and other foods provided by Challenger. During stage three, each 12-member group is given two wooden handcarts which they pull across about 130 miles of desert, emulating Mormon handcart pioneers who settled <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> in the 19th century. A graduate of the program, <PERSON> Krista </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 15, of <LOCATION> Provo </LOCATION> said it helps youths overcome social and behavioral problems by building confidence and self esteem. `` It was n't my idea of a picnic. It was a hard program,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. `` It helped me realize my potential, to see what I could do physically, emotionally and spiritually.'' She said that before her mother ordered her into the program last May, she was shy and lacked confidence. Now, she said she feels confident talking with strangers and peers, and she's confident that she can boost her grades beyond her current C-average She also believes she is better able to resist the temptation of drug abuse. Before the experience, `` My self-esteem was low enough I did n't think I was worth enough to say no I was headed for the drugs and alcohol.'' In her lawsuit, Ms. <PERSON> Zasso </PERSON> said she was working as a dental assistant in Mt. <PERSON> Kisco </PERSON> on June 15 when Challenger employees lured her into a dark hallway, subdued her and hustled her to a nearby airport for a flight to southern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Zasso </PERSON> had left home to live with her boyfriend's family and had refused to return home. She said she was subjected to a strip search and then forced to walk as much as 18 miles at a time without food and clean water. The suit also alleges that she was denied medical treatment for a concussion. She remained in the program for 42 days until 3rd District Judge <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON>, who is considering the suit, found her rights had been violated and ordered her release. <PERSON> Zasso </PERSON> praised the program in a videotaped interview conducted by Challenger employees in the desert, but she later testified that she feared she would be forced repeat the program if she did n't tell the counselors what they wanted to hear

<HEAD>GOP, Democrats Square Off in Race for Wright Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Republican physician was the highest vote-getter in a special election to replace <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but the Democrat who will face him in a runoff predicted victory in the heavily Democratic 12th District. Dr. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> garnered 21,978 ballots, or 39 percent of the vote, in Saturday's special election, but Democrat <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Geren </PERSON> was elated about his 32 percent showing _ 17,751 votes _ in the district that encompasses most of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Geren </PERSON> received a ringing endorsement from <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who had expressed no favorite in the primary. `` I want to ask all of you to redouble your efforts because here's a man I want to be my successor,'' the popular <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told supporters at a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> party for <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>. `` He is steeped in the traditions of our state and country.'' Democrat <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> finished third in the race with 22 percent of the vote, the only other candidate to garner more than 3 percent. `` Well, the Democrats won tonight,'' <PERSON> Geren </PERSON>, an attorney, told cheering supporters late Saturday. `` It took us four candidates to do it, but when you total it up, we got nearly 60 percent of the vote. I call that a victory.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned the seat June 30 after an ethics investigation uncovered 69 instances of alleged house violations. In other election results, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> government redistricting plan that supporters said would foster minority representation passed by a 2-to-1 margin. And <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> officials won a significant battle when voters in four of five <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburbs decided to retain the agency. Because no one in the eight-candidate race to replace <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> received a majority of the votes, a runoff is necessary. Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> will set a date after election results are certified. <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON>, host of a nationally syndicated TV health show, `` 60 Second Housecall,'' pointed to his success in a district traditionally dominated by Democrats, and <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in particular. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> first won election in 1955 and was re-elected 17 times in the next 34 years, often with token or no opposition. He received 88 write-in votes in Saturday's special election. However, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> carried the district in the last three presidential elections. `` Remember, now it's halftime,'' <PERSON> Lanier </PERSON> told supporters Saturday night. `` Take a breather, go to church, come back on Monday and let's get after it.'' In an emotionally charged referendum, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> voters overwhelmingly approved a proposal to reorganize the city council, ostensibly to equalize voting power between whites and minorities. The proposal received 41,456 votes to 20,823 against. However, an analysis by The Dallas Morning News of voting patterns in Saturday's election showed that more than 85 percent of those who voted in the city's predominantly minority districts opposed the plan. The plan passed citywide because of overwhelming support from white voters. The so-called `` 10-4-1'' plan calls for the addition of two single districts and four quadrant representatives, leaving the mayor as the only at-large member of the city council. Opponents, who had their own plan, argued that adding seats would dilute minority strength. A lawsuit challenging the current 8-3 plan is scheduled to be heard Sept. 5 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchmeyer </PERSON>, who also is reviewing the 10-4-1 plan. The five suburban elections were crucial to about one-fifth of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> transit agency's sales tax income, and to the fate of a regional transportation system. Voters in <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rowlett </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION> decided by margins of 59 percent or more to stay in DART. <PERSON> Coppell </PERSON> rejected <PERSON> DART </PERSON> by a 20-vote margin, but officials there said a recount is likely. In June, DART approved a $ 2.45 billion plan to crisscross the metropolitan area with 66 miles of light rail by 2010. The plan also called for 18 miles of rail connecting downtown to the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and 37 miles of bus and car pool lanes for suburban commuters.

 Israeli security forces and <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militiamen captured a Lebanese man who allegedly assisted a suicide car bomb attack that wounded five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, the army said Sunday. The 28-year-old man, identified as a mercenary of the Moslem fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> group, was captured in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the day of the car bombing attack, but the army withheld the information until Sunday, an army statement said. The army would not give his name, and a military spokesman would not say if the man was being held by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> or <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> security forces. Five Israeli soldiers were wounded, one critically, when a car packed with 550 pounds of explosives blew up near a convoy of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> troops. The Shiite Moslem group <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the bombing and released a videotape showing the driver, Sheikh <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> <PERSON> Biro </PERSON>, who killed himself in the attack. There was no immediate word from <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> on the arrest. The army statement said the purported assistant was a resident of the village of <LOCATION> Markaba </LOCATION>, about a mile from the Israeli border. It said he was recruited by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to organize attacks in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The alleged assistant let <PERSON> Biro </PERSON> stay the night before the bombing at his home in the security zone, the statement said. It said the two tried unsuccessfully to plant an explosive device that day. The man helped <PERSON> Biro </PERSON> get to the area where the car bomb detonated but was not in the car at the time, the army said. The security zone is a six - by 10-mile-wide strip in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> where <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintained a military force after the withdrawal of most of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, is a fundamentalist Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> faction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that is considered to be the umbrella organization for extremist groups holding foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Sixteen foreigners are being held, including eight Americans.

<HEAD>Rhode Island Victory Day Holiday Again Provokes Outcry</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 10th graf, `Japan surrendered...,' to CORRECT date to May
sted March.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some Japanese-Americans are trying to change the name of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s Victory Day holiday because they say the popular name _ `` V-J Day'' for `` Victory in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'' _ is racist. The holiday Monday is still celebrated only in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where by tradition it creates a long weekend when virtually everything shuts down and people head to the beach. This year, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> has hired lawyers to try to change the name. `` Unfortunately, the name Victory Day has caused persistent use of the appellation ` V-J Day' by the public, by the press, businesses, state offices,'' said one of the lawyers, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> declined to say how the group might pursue a lawsuit, but said she has asked Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>'s office to press for a name change or a way to force people to use the holiday's official name. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, spokesman for <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON>, said the attorney general can not `` require the citizens of the state to call the holiday by a particular name.'' `` It's not the holiday itself that's bothering me. It's the name,'' said <PERSON> Hiromi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lima </PERSON>, 44, a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> resident for 16 years. `` I feel a bit of discrimination against the Japanese race.'' <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> veterans' groups are adamant that the name should remain unchanged. `` Leave that ... holiday alone,'' said <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Poissant </PERSON>, state service officer for the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Veterans of Foreign Wars. `` It's too bad they did n't think of that when they attacked us.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s surrender, the old `` V-E Day'' for `` Victory in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' came May 7, 1945. Attorney <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the holiday's nickname `` discriminates on the basis of race against Japanese-Americans'' and `` impugns the character of Japanese-Americans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, many of whose families have been here for generations, or many of whom fought in World War II.'' Mindful of the popularity of the long weekend, politicians have never seriously discussed repealing the holiday, established in 1948. There have been attempts in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to change its name to `` Peace Day'' or `` Remembrance Day,'' but all have been sunk by the powerful veterans' lobby. The legislature did pass a resolution in 1987 reaffirming the `` Victory Day'' name after concerns were raised that the holiday would make it more difficult for <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> to attract Japanese business. `` They started the war. We won the war,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobola </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We insulted them? They insulted us by attacking.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday that Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was `` engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the hungry'' when his plane crashed on its way to a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. The president, who ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aircraft into the search for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> last week, was among the first to express condolences when an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> helicopter carrying one of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s friends and congressional colleagues found the charred wreckage in a mountain ravine <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, for the weekend was notified by telephone by his national security adviser soon after the downed plane was found. Flags were quickly lowered to half staff at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and elsewhere in official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and national leaders expressed sorrow at the loss of the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democratic congressman and other members of the traveling party. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunger </ORGANIZATION>, vanished Monday after taking off from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> for a refugee camp on the Sudanese border.

Rep. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheat </PERSON>, D-Mo., also went to the African country earlier to aid the search `` In his search to look at into the plight of the world's most desperate and hungry individuals, Rep. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> represented the best in compassion that we as a nation possess,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` His was a mission which, as we all know all too well now, was fraught with potential danger.'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s loss `` is the world's loss'' and `` deprives us all of a man whose compassion, commitment and leadership in the war against hunger saved the lives of tens of thousands of the world's children. Those of us who are his colleagues and friends can best keep his spirit alive by renewing our commitment to the cause for which he gave his life: eradicating hunger both here and around the world.' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s wife, six-weeks pregnant with their second child, remained in seclusion at her home in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Members of the congressman's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> staff, which had conducted numerous press briefings during the search, received congressional colleagues and friends privately in <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building suite of offices on Sunday. Among those visiting was the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who had prayed with <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s staff and friends during the weeklong vigil. He told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> had worked tirelessly to `` prick the conscience of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' about the starving in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` I have watched him stand in these halls and literally break down crying, trying to appeal to other congresspeople to be sensitive to the fact that people in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> ... were clutching to his ankles and dying before his eyes, with worms and flies devouring their bodies. `` And with that sense of passion and moral imperative he kept going back again and again and again,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said the those aboard the aircraft _ including a staff member, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> _ `` gave their lives nobly, in an effort to advocate on behalf of people much less fortunate than themselves. `` And I believe that the nation and the world have lost a considerable number of very caring and compassionate and concerned human beings,'' said <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>. Describing him as someone `` who wore his feelings and compassion right out in the open, in a very vulnerable and caring and wonderful way,'' <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> said he would miss <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> `` beyond comprehension.'' Other House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> members, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and civil rights leaders were among those expressing their grief. `` There is a special Jewish word that describes <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, ` mensch' _ it means ` a real human being.' The Anti-Defamation League has been privileged to know and work with him,'' said league national director <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foxman </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> died as he lived: `` On a mission of mercy and hope for victims of poverty, injustice, racism and hunger Where ever suffering people existed on our planet, <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> wanted to be there to help.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> an outstanding statesman and humanitarian and praised his relentless efforts on behalf of the hungry. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which had four employees aboard the plane, said the traveling party represented the best in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s tradition of reaching out to those in need Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> said: `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> was a strong representative, a champion of the helpless and he was my good friend. Mrs. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and I jin his family and many friends around the world in mourning his death.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' other senator, Republican <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, said his heart went out to <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s family `` in this tragic time. He will be missed.'' <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a veteran civil rights leader and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> city councilman, called <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> `` truly a human rights warrior.'' `` I do n't know that I've met a congressman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that was more sensitive or committed,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` Not only <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but the country has lost one of its most relevant black leaders.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> brought `` a real sense of urgency on poverty'' to his work in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> was sensitive to the issue of hunger and it bothered him deeply that in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the homeland, hunger was ravaging the population,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, friends and colleagues streamed into <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s downtown office as news spread that the wreckage had been discovered Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Democrat, said with a breaking voice, `` This is a very difficult time for <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>.

 Soviet authorities, dealing with a strike in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, face new work stoppages in the republics of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> over nationalist issues, union leaders said Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday that as many as 40,000 Russian-speaking workers in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> were striking to protest what they feel are discriminatory laws recently passed on preserving the Estonian language and limiting the voting rights of immigrants. Pravda sided with their demands. The People's Front of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> called a general strike Monday in `` non-strategic industries'' to demand local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials move to a more democratic structure, said activist <PERSON> Aidin </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirbekov </PERSON> in a telephone interview. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, pro-independence activists had called for a general strike to begin Tuesday. There were conflicting reports on whether it would proceed. The ethnic Russian strikers in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> won support from a key source Sunday. Under the headline, `` And what about civil rights?'' Pravda charged that the new Estonian election law, which sets tough residency requirements, violates the Soviet constitutional equal rights provision. `` As is known, the Constitution has not yet been abandoned,'' Pravda said. The article criticized the Estonian lawmakers, who have led the call for human rights guarantees, for restricting the voting rights of non-Estonians. The new law limits voting to residents who have lived in the same district for two years or anywhere in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for five years. Candidates must live in the same place for five years, or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. A new language law requires most workers to learn Estonian. Many Russian workers have not, even after decades of living in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, and natives complain that many police and ambulance personnel can not understand their language. A <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> activist said workers in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> demonstrated for a second night Sunday, but <PERSON> Amirbekov </PERSON>, speaking from the town, denied that report. <PERSON> Amirbekov </PERSON> said workers at manufacturing plants are being asked to strike Monday to support demands that local leaders `` find political solutions instead of military ones'' to the republic's ethnic violence, which has caused dozens of deaths He said workers in strategic industries, such as <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>'s extensive oil complex, were asked to stay on the job. Some activists in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> are demanding removal of Soviet troops from the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and an end to curfews in the republic, but <PERSON> Amirbekov </PERSON> said authorities believe relations are too tense to consider that step. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, which traditionally is Shiite Moslem, has been embroiled in a dispute with neighboring <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, whose population is mainly Christian, over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is part of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, but its population is predominantly Armenian, and <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> wants to annex it. In <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, work has at least partially halted at 26 enterprises in the capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> and at 13 factories in <LOCATION> Kohtla-Jarve </LOCATION>, the labor newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Trud </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Train workers were on strike and the state airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> carried only emergency supplies and passengers, <PERSON> Trud </PERSON> said. The Russians, most of who work in heavy industrial plants, also object to a new national decision to give <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and the two other Baltic republics, free rein over its economy. In asserting their rights, ethnic Estonians have angered immigrant workers from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and elsewhere. The workers are demanding that factories with a mainly Russian-speaking labor force remain the property of the national government rather than be handed over to <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Artur </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapityem </PERSON> at the Russians' strike headquarters in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> said by telephone that leaders were in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to meet with <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders since they have refused to negotiate with Estonian officials. `` We no longer trust the republic's leadership,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lysenko </PERSON> of the strike committee as saying. <PERSON> Kapityem </PERSON> denied Pravda's report that criminal charges had been filed against labor leaders under an emergency Estonian decree banning the strike. Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the population. Russians make up about a third of the 1.6 million people.

 The oldest space shuttle glided to a perfect landing in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> on Sunday, completing a secret mission to deploy a spy satellite and reportedly conduct `` Star Wars'' experiments. `` A super team and a great machine _ welcome home, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Culbertson </PERSON>, an astronaut from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, said as the five-man crew landed shortly after sunrise, ending a five-day, one hour and 56-minute journey of more than 2 million miles. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, though dirty, sustained little damage to the tiles that protect it from the heat of the fiery re-entry, and no tiles appeared to be missing, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenner </PERSON>, shuttle support manager for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> at Edwards. It was the first mission in 3 -LCB- years for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, which inaugurated shuttle flights in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s last flight ended 10 days before the January 1986 Challenger disaster that killed its crew of seven. `` It was an apparently perfect landing,'' observed <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Welcome home, space cowboy!'' friends and relatives yelled at pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> shortly before he and the other astronauts departed aboard two <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION> jets bound for <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richards </PERSON> told a crowd of about 100 spectators that <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s mission represented `` a reaffirmation that human beings belong in space We can do wonderful things there. We can excite our kids and make our planet a better place to live.'' The astronauts and their wives arrived in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> around 4 p.m. CDT. They were greeted by their families and about 300 cheering friends and co-workers. `` It was a real privilege to participate in the restoration of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> to flight status,'' the shuttle's commander, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, told the crowd at <LOCATION> Ellington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>. `` It was a privilege to accomplish what we accomplished on this flight for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` It was n't nice; it was fantastic,'' added <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander and one of three space rookies on the flight. After a 15-minute ceremony, the astronauts shook hands and hugged many of the well-wishers before climbing into vans and heading home with their families. The landing ended the 30th mission of the shuttle program. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, for a years a `` hangar queen'' that was stripped of parts to keep other shuttles flying, had undergone more than 250 modifications called for after the Challenger disaster. The other crew members were <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leestma </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The shuttle's sonic booms startled slumbering <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> as it hurtled across <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Minutes later, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> guided the 97-ton orbiter to a 6:37 a.m. PDT landing on a hard clay runway, the aircraft trailing a plume of dust. A news blackout was imposed on the mission by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said Wednesday that a satellite was deployed by the astronauts during their first day in orbit on Tuesday. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> maintained the official silence about the satellite's purpose, but it is widely believed to be a 10-ton spy satellite designed to take detailed photographs of military targets over a wide area of the globe, including most of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> It would help the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> verify Soviet compliance with arms agreements. The shuttle crew also reportedly monitored military sites on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and was believed to have conducted experiments related to the `` Star Wars'' missile defense program. The shuttle landed in perfect weather, with unrestricted visibility. The few people gathered to watch on <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> also were treated to a view of the Perseid meteor shower, which sprinkled the sky with shooting stars. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has been host to as many as half a million people for shuttle landings but was closed to the public Sunday because of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s demand for secrecy. The news media were allowed to watch and record the landing from about two miles. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> said secrecy was needed to `` limit an adversary's ability to determine the mission of a given <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> shuttle flight.''

<HEAD>Fundamentalist Leader Released, Says He Is Under House Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fundamentalist Moslem preacher charged with anti-government activities has been released from jail, but he said Sunday he was under virtual house arrest. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON>, who is blind, was acquitted twice of charges connected to the assassination of President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> in October 1981. He and 48 other defendants now are being tried on charges of illegal possession of weapons, attempting to kill a police officer and assault. The charges are punishable by death. On Thursday, a state security court trying the 49 ordered the release of 25 prisoners, including <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON>. It ordered one defendant, who is charged with bombing a theater in the southern town of <LOCATION> Fayoum </LOCATION>, to remain in detention. The 23 others accused in the case had not been jailed. <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON>, contacted by telephone at his home in <LOCATION> Fayoum </LOCATION>, said, `` I'm in good health.'' He has high blood pressure and diabetes. `` There are security forces around my house,'' he said. `` They have stopped me from going out to pray at the mosque. They are not letting me out at all and are arresting my visitors.'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Wagih </PERSON> <PERSON> Issa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> denied <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON>'s claims and said, `` He is free to move. Whoever wants to visit him may do so freely.'' The ministry, which is in charge of internal security, reportedly had invoked emergency regulations to extend the detention of the 25 who were released under the court order. <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> returned to his home Friday night. The emergency law has been in force since <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s assassination. It gives police broad powers of search and arrest without charge and bans unauthorized demonstrations and strikes. <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON>, a former theology professor at <ORGANIZATION> Assiut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> south of <LOCATION> Fayoum </LOCATION>, heads a fundamentalist Moslem group that demands the immediate and full full implementation of the Islamic law, or <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION>. The government claims 90 percent of the existing law conforms to <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> was accused of inspiring the gunmen who killed <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> and was acquitted. He also was found innocent in a later trial of 300 Moslem fundamentalists charged with an attempted coup after <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>'s assassination. In both cases, the prosecution said <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> was the spiritual leader of an underground group called Jihad that was dedicated to the overthrow of the government. He was released in 1985 following the second acquittal. The current charges against him and 48 others involve an anti-government demonstration on April 7 that the prosecution claims <PERSON> Abdel-Rahman </PERSON> led. Police rounded up about 2,500 Moslem fundamentalists for questioning after the demonstration.

The congress called for intensified military action to end the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the territories and rejected Israeli Premier <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for elections. `` What we are after is freedom, like any other people,'' <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said. `` We are asking the Israelis to come and sit down and talk to us.'' But he said that as long as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> occupies the territories the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> will continue to lead the uprising in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. More than 530 Palestinians and 38 Israelis have been killed in the uprising that began in December 1987. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has proposed elections in the occupied lands and talks with the elected Palestinian representatives on an interim self-rule solution for the 1.7 million Arabs in the territories. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, an Israeli government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he saw nothing new in <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>'s statement He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s repeated demand for guaranteeing creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state before any negotiations amounts to rejection of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s call for talks without conditions.

 A senior aide to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> owned <ORGANIZATION> Rite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stock when he participated in the 1986 appointment of an executive of the drugstore chain to the state pharmacy board, The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. The aide, <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON>, also was a guest of Rite Aid chairman <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Grass </PERSON> and his two sons, both company executives, on a January 1983 trip by corporate jet from <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to watch <ORGANIZATION> Penn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> play in the <LOCATION> Sugar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bowl </LOCATION>, according to the newspaper. At the time, <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON> was secretary of administration under then-Gov. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON> is now assistant to the attorney general. Rite Aid, the nation's largest retail pharmacy chain, and its president, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grass </PERSON>, have been indicted in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> on state bribery charges. Grass, who is accused of delivering a $ 33,000 bribe and other benefits to a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION>, is to be arraigned Tuesday. <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON> said he was infuriated by implications in the Inquirer's story about his time in state government `` I did nothing improper according to the laws,'' <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON> said in an interview Saturday night with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am truly offended.'' <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON> owned 400 of 40 million shares in Rite Aid, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. Based on the stock's 1986 price range on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, his interest was worth between $ 9,700 and $ 14,200. `` That's not a very big stake in the company,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, who also served in <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s gubernatorial administration, added that under <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> law, <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON> did nothing improper. As secretary of administration, <PERSON> Dickman </PERSON> was the key aide on appointments to state boards.

 Thousands of people marched through <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> neighborhoods of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Sunday and cheered for the violent campaign of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. `` I want to praise the real freedom fighters in this country ... I want to praise the men and women of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s political wing, told thousands of cheering supporters who stood in a pouring rain. The province's new chief police constable, <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Annesley </PERSON>, showed up at the march and <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> pointed him out to the crowd, joking that he was the man wearing five flak jackets. `` Welcome to west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>!'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> roared. The march of the <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> forces _ those who seek a united <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> _ was a much more overtly political march than a big <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> parade in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> Saturday that commemorated the 300th anniversary of a defeat of the Catholic King James II. Some marchers in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> carried placards with the names of those killed on the their side in 20 years of `` the troubles,'' and fife and drum bands chanted `` I.R.A.'' Though much of the <ORGANIZATION> republican </ORGANIZATION> emphasis last week was on the anniversary of the British government's long-discarded policy of imprisoning terrorist suspects without trial, Sunday's speeches focused on Monday's 20th anniversary of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> troops in the province. The army was sent into <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> on Aug. 14, 1969, following fierce battles between police and Roman Catholics. `` The British army came in 1969 not because we were being attacked, but because for the first time since the beginning of this state _ this misbegotton tuppence ha ` penny bastardized state _ we were fighting back,'' said <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Devlin </PERSON> <PERSON> McAliskey </PERSON>, a fiery leader in the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> civil rights marches of the `` The reasons they are still here 20 years after is because we are still fighting back,'' she said. In a speech in which she compared the throngs of reporters and photographers to `` some kind of diseased butterflies that seem to thrive on other peoples' problems,'' she said little had been gained in 20 years. The principle of `` one man, one vote'' had been secured, but real political power had been taken away, she said. Catholics were twice as likely as Protestants to be unemployed 20 years ago, but now she said they are 2 -LCB- times more likely to be without work. `` Everything we got out of them we squeezed out of them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> McAliskey </PERSON> said. `` Yet it was nothing, because every time we gained something they clawed it back. ... Have we come 20 years for nothing? No. Something has changed, and I'll tell you what has changed ... We have changed.'' The thousands who marched up the <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Andersontown </LOCATION> on Sunday represent only a minority within <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic community. In election after election, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> has pulled about half as many votes as the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is committed to peaceful change. The Social Democrats have taken no part in the marches this weekend. Security was strict along the parade route, and march organizers complained that the crowd was constrained too closely by armored <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rovers </ORGANIZATION>. There were no incidents during or after the parade, said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> police force. A dozen people were arrested early Sunday in <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> after 20 gasoline bombs were thrown at officers, the constabulary said. No one was injured. More than 2,700 people have died in 20 years of violence in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, which is divided between Catholics who generally favor a united <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and Protestants who support continued British rule. Two-thirds of the dead were civilians.

<HEAD>Arson Blamed in Fatal Rooming House Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Arson caused a fire blamed for the deaths of three people in a rooming house that had no fire escape and a substandard sprinkler system, investigators said Sunday. About 10 people representing local, state and federal investigative agencies, most of whom had previously said they suspected arson, met for two hours to discuss Tuesday's fire at the Ben Crest Plaza rooming house. The group reached `` a final conclusion that it was arson involving the use of an accelerant,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, assistant district attorney for <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. An accelerant is a substance such as gasoline used to accelerate a fire. He said it would take a week or more before the accelerant was identified. After the fire struck, tenants clad only in their night clothes had to leap from windows to escape the flames. Some swung down on ropes the management had provided as fire escapes. More than 19 tenants and rescuers were hurt. Before the fire, the city had filed a criminal complaint against the building's owner, <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Allard </PERSON>, for failing to install a sprinkler system covering each room as required by a 2-year-old ordinance. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said authorities had no suspects or possible motive in mind. `` There are two angles to this, motive and opportunity, who was around at the time,'' he said. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> declined to provide further details, such as where the fire might have begun, saying he did n't want to influence anyone who would be questioned. Some 50 or 60 people, including the rooming house tenants, were interviewed already. Authorities were still hunting for two rooming house residents seen around the time of the fire who have n't been seen since although they are assumed to have escaped safely, he said. <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said a search dog trained to locate human remains failed to find any trace of the missing men inside the burned-out building. In the meantime, the rooming house, actually two joined buildings _ one five stories, the other four stories _ was being torn down, floor by floor. The demolition could yield more clues, <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON> said. Attending Sunday's meeting were representatives of the state fire marshal; the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>; state police; <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> fire and police officials; <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVirgilio </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Youth Dies of Gunshot Wound, Gaza Strip Workers Attacked</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 16-year-old Palestinian died Sunday of wounds suffered in a clash with soldiers, and troops dispersed bands of masked youths attacking <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> workers applying for entry permits to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Arab hospital officials said 11 Palestinians were shot and wounded Sunday in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The death raised to 536 the number of Arabs killed in the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. Thirty-eight Israelis have been slain in the violence. Also Sunday, one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s leading religious figures said that under Jewish law, the concept of preserving Jewish lives took precedence over all other commandments, including settling the biblical land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But Rabbi <PERSON> Ovadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> of the ultraorthodox <ORGANIZATION> Shas </ORGANIZATION> political party did not make the anticipated religious ruling on returning territories to preserve Jewish lives. He said relinquishing territories at this time is not realistic because there is no <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> partner for peace. Jewish settlers living in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> claim there is a religious imperative for them to settle there. <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON>, addressing an assembly of about 1,000 ultraorthodox Jews in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, did not retract his statement made to <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> last month that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could return territories to avoid loss of lives in a war. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, speaking at the same assembly, said he favored territorial compromise so <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could maintain a Jewish majority in its own state. `` Between claiming our right to the -LRB- biblical -RRB- land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> _ and I do n't doubt that right _ and losing the Jewishness of the state ... I want a Jewish state within its own borders with the Jewish traditions,'' he said. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s left-leaning Labor party favors territorial compromise while Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc is opposed. The latest Palestinian to die in the uprising was <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, 16. The army said he was shot during a clash with troops Saturday at the <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camp in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, and he died at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Also in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a 32-year-old taxi driver, <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Darwish </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dahrouj </PERSON>, was fatally shot Saturday, and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> sources said he was killed because it was believed he collaborated with with Israeli authorities. He was the 95th Palestinian killed by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as a suspected collaborator. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at youths throwing stones at about 5,000 Palestinian workers applying for entry permits near the <LOCATION> Erez </LOCATION> crossing in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab witnesses said. An army spokesman said troopers dispersed rioters but no one was injured seriously. He would not say if tear gas and rubber bullets were used. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, in an effort to limit the uprising, is requiring all Palestinians with jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to have entry permits. Both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and leaders of the uprising are trying to control the workers' movements. A military official said the fighting at <LOCATION> Erez </LOCATION> began after officials turned away hundreds of people from an application office because of the large number of workers waiting. The office has been handling up to 1,000 applicants daily. About 50,000 Gazans work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and for many families their jobs are the only income. The military official said about 40,000 permits have been issued.

<HEAD>Five Volunteer Firefighters Charged With Setting Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Five volunteer firefighters and a sixth person have been arrested and charged with setting 16 fires, a newspaper reported Sunday. The arrests Friday grew out of an investigation by police and the arson squad of the <LOCATION> Bergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor's Office into 50 suspicious fires, according to The Record of <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>. The 16 fires occurred in a railroad boxcar, trash bins, brush and abandoned mattresses between January 1988 and last June. No one was injured. The prosecutor's office said the fires `` were started by the five borough firemen and one juvenile female who enjoyed watching her boyfriend fight the arson blaze.'' There was no other indication of motive. The six were charged in <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rutherford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with failure to report or control dangerous fires, the Record reported. All but the juvenile, whose name police did not release, were charged with criminal mischief. Four of the people charged were released on their own recognizance. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dechert </PERSON>, 21, and <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON>, 20, were also charged with arson. <PERSON> Dechert </PERSON> was released on $ 50,000 bail. <PERSON> Gillies </PERSON> was released on $ 20,000 bail, the Record said. Also charged were <PERSON> Dechert </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, 18, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivelli </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, 20. The five volunteer firefighters were to be suspended from the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rutherford </ORGANIZATION> department until the outcome of their cases, Fire Chief <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Klamerus </PERSON> told the Record.

 For more than a year platoon leader <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> <PERSON> Turba </PERSON> patrolled the border between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, his automatic rifle at the ready to stop anyone attempting to flee to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. In July, he slipped away from his comrades, tossed his rifle aside and scrambled over the barbed-wire and concrete barriers to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` I just could n't take it anymore,'' <PERSON> Turba </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Sunday, the 28th anniversary of the building of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. <LOCATION> Turba </LOCATION>, 20, spoke of the daily life of communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s elite border troopers _ young men selected by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and military officials because of their loyality to the state <PERSON> Turba </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, said border guards were told in April that a shoot-to-kill order against civilians trying to flee <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had been lifted. But he said most of his comrades had quietly ignored the order during their border service. `` Only about 10 percent of the hard-core, gung-ho troops would shoot at an unarmed civilian attempting to flee,'' <PERSON> Turba </PERSON> said. `` They're the macho types who like strutting around with their machine guns looking tough.'' But he said it was a great risk for the border guards to allow someone to escape. `` If you let someone escape, you go to prison,'' he said. `` It's also very risky because you patrol in pairs, and you never know what the other guy is thinking or what he would do `` But I hoped, and many others did as well, that I would never have to arrest someone.'' He said electronic listening devices and alarm systems, attack dogs and rows of barbed-wire usually slowed would-be escapees long enough that border troops could arrest them. Many of those caught were given long prison terms. According to West German statistics, 191 people have been killed trying to escape since the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall was erected in 1961 and the border between the two Germanies was sealed by barriers. But about 218,000 people managed to escape including 2,614 border troops, according to the statistics. <PERSON> Turba </PERSON> said he decided to flee because he had little hope of political and economic changes in his country. Unlike <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where reform communists have succeeded in expanding freedoms, East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> maintains a hard-line policy. <PERSON> Turba </PERSON> said a growing number of border guards are openly questioning the nation's border policy, which East German officials contend is necessary `` to protect socialism from Western plunderers.'' `` You sit in your freezing bunker or guard tower and begin to ask yourself what this border is for and what you are doing,'' <PERSON> Turba </PERSON> said. `` You reach a point where you realize its senseless and brutal.'' He said morale among border units is slumping because the increasing number of escape attempts brings additional pressure from their officers. Frustration and disillusionment lead many troopers to break regulations, according to <LOCATION> Turba </LOCATION>. `` Some people bring books to read in the towers. Others rig their field radios to tune into Western broadcasts. The political officer once took off to go hunting,'' he said. On July 12, <PERSON> Turba </PERSON> told his comrades he had problems with his motorcycle and he needed to take it for a test drive. He roared over a hill, coasted to the border barriers and bounded to freedom. `` There are a lot of weak points along the border and we know them best,'' he said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed his `` profound sadness'' Sunday at the crash in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> of an airplane that was carrying Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 15 other persons. Returning to the White House by helicopter from Camp David, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also conveyed his thanks to the government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military team that found the wreckage. `` I want to ... simply express the profound sadness that we feel at the loss of the lives in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>,'' said the president. He said he had not yet spoken with the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> congressman's wife, <PERSON> Alison </PERSON>, `` but I certainly express my profound sadness, profound regrets over all of this to her, and to their child.'' His somber mood lifting for a moment, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recalled with a smile that `` in a happier time,'' both <PERSON> Lelands </PERSON> had been his guests at a recent barbecue for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawn </LOCATION> of the White House. `` It's a sadness for everybody. He was an outstanding man, a man of great humor,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said of the Democratic congressman from his hometown of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` Everyone from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> knew of his lively nature and his commitment to helping others. So it is with profound sadness that I convey to his family and to his colleagues and to his staff the regrets that all Americans feel,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also thanked `` everybody that involved themselves in this almost unprecedented search, and certainly the government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, who could not, I'm told, have been more cooperative.'' Asked if the Ethiopians had requested assistance to determine how the crash occurred, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied: `` Not that I know of, but they certainly will get any cooperation on that from us, just as we did, have fully cooperated on the search. He added, `` It has been unprecedented and the result is terrible but I must commend the courageous men and women in the armed services that joined in this search. It was really a very difficult search, and they did it well, against bad weather, a lot of things. So it was quite special and showed us pulling together.'' When a reporter asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had anything to say about the cause <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> died for _ fighting world hunger _ the president said no. `` This is n't a time to say anything but how sad and profoundly sad I feel about the fate of the people on that plane,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief liaison to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and a deputy, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Calio </PERSON>, would join a congressional delegation that will fly to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> on an official mission to bring back the bodies after they are identified. It was uncertain when they will depart. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in which the president said he was `` truly saddened to hear that the discovery of <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s aircraft revealed that apparently there were no survivors of this tragic accident.'' `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and the other members of his traveling party, both Americans and Ethiopians, were engaged in a noble cause _ trying to feed the hungry. I have known, admired and worked with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> for many years. His sense of compassion and desire to help those in need has aided millions of people from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>,'' it said.

The pilot of Flight 1249 to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, reported `` a flameout'' at 1:33 p.m. and was forced to return to the gate, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>, spokesman at <LOCATION> Stapleton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He said there were no injuries reported among the 128 passengers and seven crew members. A preliminary look at the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727's No. 2 engine, which is mounted in the tail of the plane, showed an apparent failure in the turbine section, said <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. He said an initial examination of the engine showed no external damage but inside `` apparently some blades in the turbine section were missing. It appears it was completely contained within the turbine section.'' Airport workers `` discovered a substantial number of rotor blades and scrap metal on the runway,'' <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said. `` It is very unusual to have an engine do that on a 727. I ca n't remember the last time it happened, if it actually ever happened before,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> He said the engine was manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>. `` Shortly after the captain initiated his takeoff roll, an indicator came on in the cockpit showing one of the engines was not at full power,'' said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>. The pilot followed procedure by returning to the gate, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` We were getting ready to taxi off,'' said passenger <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bremmer </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` He -LRB- the pilot -RRB- kept going and going. The nose lifted up just a bit but it was mushy. The pilot set it down. He put the engines in full reverse.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the airline believes a portion of the engine `` disintegrated'' but did not explode, since the debris did not penetrate other portions of the aircraft. The pilot told passengers that an engine fan blade broke and that the pieces were sucked into the engine, causing it to blow apart, said passenger <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Earlier, <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON> said indications were that the engine had exploded. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said 727s, which have all three engines mounted near the rear of the plane, are designed to take off with just two engines. The No. 2 engine has come under scrutiny recently in DC-10 aircraft, which are larger than 727s, but <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said there is `` no comparison whatsoever to the DC-10 question.'' The failure of a No. 2 engine is believed to have been involved in a crash and two other incidents, including the crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, last month. In that accident, in which 111 people died, the tail engine exploded, severing all three of the plane's hydraulic flight control systems. Last week, a Northwest DC-10 made an emergency landing in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> after its No. 2 tail engine apparently started disintegrating in flight, nicking the hydraulic lines but not severing them. On Friday, a third DC-10 bound for <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> aborted takeoff in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> because of a stalled compressor in the tail-mounted engine, officials said. Cole, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said there are 1,764 727s flying, and it is the most used plane in the world. The passengers of Flight 1249 were put on another flight to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> on Sunday afternoon, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. Federal authorities have been notified of the incident, he said.

 Four heavily armed fugitives in south-central <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Sunday released their three hostages, including two television reporters, and made a getaway in a plane provided by authorities, police said. Police said four traded their captives for an aircraft and pilot to end a three-day standoff with police on a highway near the town of <LOCATION> Presidente </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prudente </LOCATION>, 635 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janieiro </LOCATION>. They were armed with hand grenades, submachine guns, pistols and shotguns. Police said the hostages were unharmed. `` I lived for four days with a pistol at my head but not for one minute did I believe I would die,'' said <PERSON> Monica </PERSON> <PERSON> Calassa </PERSON>, one of the hostages. `` A person who trades her life for that of another ca n't die like that. It was not clear where the plane was headed. The fugitives, two married couples, earlier had indicated they wanted to be flown to <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. Brazilian media identified the fugitives' leader as <PERSON> Rui </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribeiro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> and said he owns a farm in <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. `` The plane departed late this afternoon but is flying at a very low altitude and we are not able to pick them up on the radar,'' policeman <PERSON> Nivaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pirondi </PERSON> said by telephone from <ORGANIZATION> Presidente </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prudente </ORGANIZATION>. The pilot was <PERSON> Aniceto </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, a rancher and mayor of the rural town of <LOCATION> Pantalina </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Goias </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Pirondi </PERSON> said. He voluntered to fly the hostages to a destination of their choice, <PERSON> Pirondi </PERSON> said. Police said a sixth man, apparently a friend of <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>', had accompanied the pilot on the flight. The plane's departure ended a three-day standoff between more than 100 police and the fugitives, who had led police on a 500-mile chase through three states since Wednesday. On Wednesday, the fugitives were paid a $ 42,000 ransom and given an armored car and driver in exchange for a 9-year-old boy thay had kidnapped on Aug. 3. Three local newswomen offered to take the place of the young boy, and the kidnappers later released the one of the reporters. However, <LOCATION> Goias </LOCATION> state authorities on Wednesday failed to provide a plane for their escape, and the kidnappers began their flight. The kidnappers stopped only for gasoline and food from a roadside cafeteria. To eat, one kidnapper stepped from the car holding a pistol to a newswoman's head. Several previous attempts to negotiate the hostages' release had failed.

 A man tried to swim handcuffed across part of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> on Sunday in a symbolic fund raiser for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s beleaguered pro-democracy movement, but had to stop short of his goal when a support boat sank `` We were n't doing bad; we're just disappointed we did n't finish,'' said <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> `` Magilla'' <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON>, who with three Chinese students was trying to swim 10 miles from <LOCATION> Crystal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, to the Erie Basin Marina here They were forced to stop about eight miles into the 10-mile swim. Two swimmers from the Erie, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, area had better luck than the 38-year-old Buffalo actor and writer. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Snell </PERSON>, 38, came ashore in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on Sunday morning after a 26 - to 30-mile swim that began the previous evening at <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> It was the first time anyone had completed a swim across the lake since 1975. The outboard boat that sank during <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON>' shorter swim was one of two support boats, and carried a styrofoam replica of the `` Goddess of Democracy'' statue that Chinese students erected in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tienanmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> before the June military crackdown. The boat began taking on water about two miles from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> and sank within two minutes, <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON> said. The swimmers had been in the water for about seven hours when it was called off at 3:30 p.m.. A passing boater and the <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's marine patrol helped the swimmers and the people in the boat that sank, <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON> said He said the marine patrol gave him a ticket for having an unregistered rowboat _ the boat that did n't sink. <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON> said he did n't know why the other boat sank, but speculated that a large wave or a loose drainage plug may have been the cause. <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON> has made the swim twice before for other charities, but Sunday was the first time he did it handcuffed, which he said was a metaphor for the loss of freedom in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. To swim, he used a modified dog paddle. <PERSON> Xianglong </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON>, one of the students at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> who swam with <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON>, said he was more disappointed for <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON> than in his own failure to finish the swim. `` Without this accident, he would have been successful in reaching here,'' said <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schaus </PERSON> said he made the effort `` to demonstrate that there are Americans who care about standing up for freedom, people who believe in the tenets this country was founded on.'' The swim was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> at the university to help victims of the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and provide information on the movement. The sponsors were unable to say how much money was pledged.

 Firefighters hustled to stamp out dozens of small fires ignited by lightning Sunday, but held their own against major forest and range fires that have scorched about 91,000 acres. Brief thunderstorms helped keep major fires from growing, but the lightning that accompanied them sparked nearly 100 new outbreaks in the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Payette </PERSON> national forests alone, officials said. Firefighters who parachuted into affected areas and firefighting aircraft put out most of the new fires before they burned more than an acre, said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> fire information officer <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Tocco </PERSON>. In the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, firefighters moved closer to containing a 45,524-acre fire and a 20,380-acre blaze. The two fires were 90 percent contained by Sunday afternoon, and officials projected full containment by Monday evening. Firefighters were having less success with two fires that have scorched 13,300 acres in <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. The fires had combined by Sunday to form one larger fire. Efforts to contain it were augmented by two <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopters that ferried firefighters to isolated edges of the blaze. More than 6,500 firefighters and 1,400 military personnel have battled 10 major fires in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> during recent weeks.
