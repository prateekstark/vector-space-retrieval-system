<HEAD>Engine Failure Forces DC-10 To Make Emergency Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 made an emergency landing Wednesday after the tri-motor jet's No. 2 engine apparently began breaking up and the pilot shut it down, officials said. Flight 308, carrying 256 people from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, landed without incident at <ORGANIZATION> Stapleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday about 6:30 p.m., according to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>, a spokesman at the airport. `` They experienced a severe vibration from the No. 2 engine, -LRB- and -RRB- as a precautionary measure, they elected to make an unscheduled landing,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION>, Minn.-based airline. The No. 2 engine of a DC-10 also is the focus of an investigation into the crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 last month in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, killing 111 of the nearly 300 people aboard. Flight 232's No. 2 engine apparently disintegrated, shooting shrapnel that apparently severed hydraulic lines in the jet, causing almost complete loss of control and forcing the crash-landing at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s airport. The investigation into the cause of that disaster is continuing. <PERSON> Boulware </PERSON>, who observed the damage to the aircraft after it landed Wednesday night, said there were `` multiple shrapnel-like holes in the outer cowling'' of the No. 2 engine, which on a DC-10 is mounted in the vertical stabilizer at the tail of the aircraft. The other two engines are mounted under the wings. `` One of the holes was big enough I could have stuck by hand through,'' he said. He said the holes were along the upper side of the engine cowling. `` Whatever exited, exited upward,'' he said. He also said a service door on the tail about eight inches square had been blown open, but remained attached to its hinges. <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said the landing was normal in terms of controlling the airplane, and the 245 passengers were being placed on alternate flights to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. There were 11 crew members on board, he said. <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> said the airline's mechanics will take a close look at the engine, and since <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> does n't have a maintenance base in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, the jet might have to be shuttled to <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Divorcing Couple Take Witness Stand in Battle for Embryos</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman battling for control of seven microscopic embryos said she worried about frozen storage `` killing them,'' but her husband said bringing them to life was a mistake. The couple, <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, drew a portrait of themselves Tuesday as a couple who tried desperately for nine years to have a child. Their marriage has collapsed into a battle for custody _ or ownership _ of seven frozen `` pre-embryos'' that have been in cryogenic storage since December. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 30, sued for divorce in February, and wants the embryos to remain in storage until the couple decide together what to do with them. `` I oppose the use of the pre-embryos by <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> or any donor because I do not wish to be raped of my reproductive rights,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> says she has the right to have the embryos implanted in her womb regardless of her husband's feelings. `` I do n't feel it abuses his rights,'' she testified. `` He consented to be a father and I'm willing to let him.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said she objects strongly to leaving the embryos in cold storage, where according to some testimony they could not last for more than two years. `` I believe that would be killing them,'' she said. `` I am the mother of these embryos. They are the beginning of life. They are more than just cells that mean nothing.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> acknowledged his wife has gone through physical and emotional trauma during their six attempts at conception in the in vitro program, which they entered in 1985. `` But I ca n't see where that's enough to bring a child into this world where the child will have more pain than it cost us to achieve it,'' he said. `` I do n't want my child in a single-parent home,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> told <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Blount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge hearing the case. `` I was raised in a broken home and I do n't want that for my child.'' Both <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 28, come from families of six children. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Christenberry </PERSON>, contends the embryos should be considered `` pre-born children'' and allowed to come to term in Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' body. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, attorney for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said there have been tremendous advances in helping infertile women such as Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. He contends that because she could reasonably expect to become pegnant with another man after her divorce, it is unnecessary to use these particular seven embryos. Under his questioning, zoologist <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Shivers </PERSON> said the success rate of in vitro programs `` will definitely go up'' in coming years. Testimony Monday indicated the national average for successful implantations is 18 percent. The <PERSON> Davises </PERSON> said they met in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> while in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and married nine years ago. Mrs. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> suffered five tubal pregnancies, one of which she said nearly killed her. The couple tried adoption, only to be told they had little chance of becoming parents that way. They joined the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> program, taking a child under their wing until its mother `` started using us sort of as a baby-sitting service,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. The trial, which began Monday, recessed until Thursday. Young is expected to rule within a month. The embroyos are in cryogenic storage at minus 180 degrees Centigrade. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he does not want the embryos destroyed, just left alone. `` Three years down the road I might have a change of heart,'' he said. In vitro fertilization produces so-called `` test-tube babies'' because the fertilization takes place outside the womb. The process was pioneered in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, where the first successful birth was recorded in 1978. The embryos in the <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> case were less than two days old when they were frozen, and consist of four to eight undifferentiated cells each, according to testimony. It is 12 to 14 days after fertilization before the cells start to take on different characteristics and technically are considered embryos, scientists testified.

 Summer reruns, topped by the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> comedy hit `` Roseanne,'' beat out original programming in the latest Nielsen ratings. Two other <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> shows _ `` Wonder Years'' and `` Who's the Boss'' _ were next in the ratings for the week ended Aug. 6, but the network remained in third place. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> each finished the week with four shows in the Top 10, but it was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> which gained a 59th consecutive victory. `` Roseanne,'' snubbed last week in the Emmy nominations, supplanted <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers'' in the top spot. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> barroom antics fell to fourth place, tying with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Coach.'' Original programming fared poorly in the ratings, despite coming amid summer doldrums. The <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION> program `` Yesterday, Today & amp; Tomorrow'' made its debut in a tie for 19th place with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Full House.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s much-touted `` PrimeTime Live'' was in 37th place The NBC summer series `` 13 East'' dropped from 10th place last week to 35th. Another NBC summer show, `` Knight & amp; <PERSON> Daye </PERSON>,'' remained in the middle of the ratings in a four-way tie for 50th place. <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s summertime jump in the ratings has apparently bottomed out. `` Married ... With Children'' dropped to 38th place, `` Totally Hidden Video'' was 46th and `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' in the four-way tie for 50th place. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> survey with an average of 10.5. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second with 9.4 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> third with 9.2. For the season to date, from Sept. 19, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had 14.7, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 11.8 and CBS 11.7. The ratings are the percentage of the 90.4 million homes with televisions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The share is the percentage of sets in use.

<TEXT>
 After a two-month false start, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s governing party is on another `` clean start'' to reform itself. The false start was under <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who became prime minister June 2 with pledges of political reform but soon was pursued by allegations of having kept paid mistresses. Now another veteran legislator with no personal power base has been pulled up to lead the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. There was an eerie sense of deja vu in <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s acceptance remarks If he had Uno's glasses and streak of white hair, it would have been hard to discern that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had a new leader. Uno was clear of involvement in the Recruit influence-buying scandal that caused his predecessor, <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, to leave office prematurely. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> bears the minor taint of receiving the equivalent of $ 110,000 in donations from <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> over five years, but he did not receive profits from cut-price stock deals, as did most of the party leaders now sidelined. That scandal, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said on June 2, `` has had a dramatic effect on our party. I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on this development so we can make a clean start in politics and regain the confidence of our people.'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said Tuesday, after winning the party presidency, that it was `` a crucial time.'' He called for debate through which `` we can gain the people's understanding of our policies.'' `` I want to carry out reforms and pass reform legislation based on our deep self-reflection,'' he said. `` We must carry out political reforms and shed our old skin.'' Like Uno and <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, and almost everyone else in his conservative party, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said the Liberal Democrats were in a crisis. The crisis appears deeper than ever, and the calendar is moving steadily toward the next encounter with the electorate. In elections July 23, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost constrol of Parliament's upper house for the first time in the party's 34-year history. Elections for all seats in the lower house must be called by July 1990, but the Socialist-led opposition in the upper chamber will try to create a legislative deadlock to make the government hold them sooner. So low is the Liberal Democrats' popularity that analysts expect they would lose their majority in the lower house. The reasons are many, and not easy to overcome. Despite a pledge not to impose a new major tax, the governing party bulldozed a 3 percent sales tax through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. When it was coupled with reductions in personal income and inheritance taxes, the net effect was a reduction in the average household's tax burden, but the sales tax remains unpopular. It also produces 10 percent of government revenue, which makes abolishing it expensive. Although the Recruit scandal ended officially in April with the indictment of two legislators on bribe-taking charges, it lives on in the minds of many who feel party leaders should not have escaped prosecution. Among those who did was <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who preceded <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> as prime minister. The easy money politicians reaped from the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was spread so widely that nearly all top Liberal Democratic figures were tainted, making it impossible for them to succeed <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> or Uno.

The last `` Bloom County'' comic strip appeared in papers last weekend. Breathed, who won a Pulitzer Prize for cartooning in 1987, plans to begin work on a new strip called `` Outland'' that will begin Sept. 3. `` Outland'' features a black ghetto child who was a `` Bloom County'' regular.

 The pies lining the two shelves behind the counter at the Club Cafe have always been in demand. Now, they're in court. When <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNanna </PERSON> bought 51 percent of the cafe in May, he thought he was buying the restaurant's award-winning recipes, too. But then the baker _ <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a former part-owner who had the recipes in her head _ quit and <PERSON> McNanna </PERSON> sued to get the recipes back. `` They're not written down someplace,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> `` The recipes are something my client has developed over many years.'' Attorneys still are taking depositions and will request a final hearing in a month or so in chancery court to determine ownership of the recipes, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. In the meantime, the 45-year-old Club Cafe still offers, for $ 1 a slice, 14 varieties of pies: peanut butter, chocolate, coconut, banana, lemon, pineapple, egg custard, pecan, apple, Dutch apple, cherry, blueberry, banana split and strawberry. And four cheesecakes. <PERSON> McNanna </PERSON> says the pies these days are every bit as good as Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s, and his baker, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, a 14-year veteran at the restaurant, agrees. `` The pies, we have it down to an art,'' <PERSON> McNanna </PERSON> said. `` Just right after she quit, we had it down pretty close.'' The customers? `` They ca n't tell the difference,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said. But some say they can. `` My opinion is that the crust is n't as good,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, an administrative assistant for a judge who's been a regular at the cafe for about five years. `` If you've had the way the pies used to be, you know what's genuine and what's imitation,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said `` We true Hot Springs natives could brag that we had the best pies in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>.'' Businessman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> has been indulging in Club Cafe pies since he was a teen-ager 30 years ago, when he was known as the `` Dutch Apple Kid.'' <PERSON> Horner </PERSON> said he could n't quite put his finger on the difference. `` It seems like it's not quite up to what it used to be,'' he said. `` But they're still good pies.'' <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, 19, who used to help out at the restaurant when her mother worked there, said she ca n't taste any difference and she's sampled everything on the pie menu. `` They taste the same to me. The meringue has a different texture, but the fillings are the same,'' she said. <PERSON> West </PERSON> said he cranks out 50 to 70 pies a day, a job he calls more stressful than his old duty of cooking the main meals. The chocolate pie, one of several crowned with 3 inches of meringue, is his customers' favorite, with coconut next, he said. Under a temporary restraining order issued in May, Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> has been barred from the Club Cafe premises and is working as a waitress at a local Oriental restaurant. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said there are no orders preventing her from baking elsewhere. Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> filed a counterclaim in June asking that the sale of the 51 percent share to <PERSON> McNanna </PERSON> be rescinded because of a dispute over payment on a $ 40,000 banknote for her mother and aunt, who each owned a 20 percent share in the cafe. Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> had owned the remaining 11 percent sold to <PERSON> McNanna </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, still owns 29 percent of the restaurant and <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> owns the remaining 20 percent. <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Monty </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pawn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, said he's gone into the cafe just about every day since 1954 and has seen a lot of changes, though the same faded red-and-white `` Club Cafe'' sign still hangs over the door. `` Five to six years ago, you could come here for lunch and there'd be a line out the door,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. But until the last couple of months, that was n't the case anymore, he said. `` There are lots of new faces,'' <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said. `` More tourists seem to be coming in here.'' `` It's kind of funny, getting all the publicity,'' <PERSON> West </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Bush Says Hostage Crisis Resolution May Not Come Soon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would be willing to negotiate for the release of American hostages held in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> if it could be done without endangering others, according to a published interview. `` I have no problem with that ... if I can talk to somebody and get the release of an American hostage and do it without, in my view or in the view of the experts, putting others at risk'' of being taken hostage, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an interview appearing in Wednesday's editions of The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. `` I have no reason to say that I can see in the short run a total resolution of the American hostage problem. I wish I could,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would continue using quiet diplomacy rather than military force to resolve the crisis. `` I have tried to keep from escalating matters by making a lot of loud threats,'' he said. `` I have had to take certain prudent actions ... We are trying to handle this where diplomacy can be most effective.'' But the president played down the possibility of imminent freedom for the eight American hostages held in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Tuesday rejected the idea of swapping the captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for $ 2 billion in Iranian assets frozen nearly ago decade ago. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> dismissed the possibility of such an exchange. `` The questions of the assets have no connection or linkage whatsoever with the hostage issue,'' he said. The president said he was `` satisfied'' that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence network in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had improved in recent years `` but we still do n't have the intelligence that I would like to have. If we had better intelligence, we might be able to surgically extract the Americans that are still held hostage.''

 Beach-goers ready to frolic in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastal waters should be prepared to encounter contamination from toxic chemicals, sewage discharge and medical waste, a private environmental group said today. `` Few regions of the country have escaped the effects of coastal pollution,'' the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said in a report released today. The report, which examined a variety of ocean pollutants, suggested the trend toward growing coastal contamination can be reversed over the next decade, but only through strict pollution control measures and curbs in development along coastal areas. `` Each year our factories dump no less than 5 trillion gallons of wastewater into coastal waters,'' the report said. `` We flush another 2.3 trillion gallons of sewage into them. And every time it rains or snows, massive amounts of poisonous substances, including gasoline and pesticides, are carried into the sea as runoff from our city streets and farms.'' Half of the nation's population lives within 50 miles of coastal waters, including the Great Lakes system, the report said, noting that the population in many coastal regions is expected to increase sharply over the next decade. The report cited as examples of the coastal pollution problem: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s designation of three locations in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Puget Sound as priority toxic cleanup sites under the federal Superfund law because of sediment contamination _ The closing of parts of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Casco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in recent years to clam and mussel digging because of bacterial pollution from inadequately treated sewage that was allowed into the waters Sediments in the bay also were found to be contaminated with heavy metals, PCBs and an assortment of pesticides. _ Continued high levels of the toxic pesticide DDT in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> 20 years after it was dumped into the water by industry The pesticide was banned in 1972. _ The forced closing of at least 40 beaches in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> during the first three weeks of this summer because of sewage contamination _ The oil industry's routine dumping into offshore waters of thousands of tons of waste material, including `` drilling mud'' that contains toxic chemicals Medical waste on beaches, which attracted widespread attention last summer, continues to be a problem, the report said. Such wastes have been reported on beaches in 17 states this summer. `` Even supposedly clean beaches are far from safe,'' said the report, entitled `` Ebb Tide for Pollution.'' About one-fourth of all sewage wastewater `` is dumped directly into coastal waters'' and much more is released into rivers that eventually reaches the ocean, the report said. Pollution from a variety of sources increasingly is showing up in fish and shellfish in many parts of the country, it said. Even the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> contributes to the problem, the report said. Of up to 700 million cubic yards of material dredged by the Corps from harbors and channels each year, as much as 35 million cubic yards are highly contaminated from pesticides, heavy metals, PCBs and oil, according to the study. Much of the dredged material is dumped in the ocean. The environmental group called for tighter controls on toxic industrial pollutants as well as runoff pollutants from agriculture and other sources, a ban on all discharges of raw sewage into waters and more effective treatment programs and tighter land-use and zoning requirements to curb coastal development. It also urged a halt of ocean dumping of medical wastes or the discharge of plastics from vessels, sewers or other sources, and a comprehensive program to protect coastal waters from oil spills including a tightening of restrictions on offshore drilling and tanker shipments.

<HEAD>Drug Abuse Not a `Black Problem,' Urban League Leader Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Drug abuse is not merely a `` black problem'' but a national dilemma that will require major resources to solve, say leaders attending the national Urban League convention. `` We ca n't talk about the future we want to see for urban America without talking about the No. 1 threat in our inner cities today: illegal drugs,'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the league Tuesday, as the drug issue received heavy attention from the largely black organization. Urban League President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, in an interview Tuesday, said, `` We believe the federal government ought to ... mobilize this nation to a realization that this is not a black problem but a national problem that will require national resources.'' But <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> and others attending the meeting called for efforts to protect the innocent during crackdowns in housing projects. The league today concludes its four-day convention, which included a puppet show at a forum on drug abuse. <PERSON> Lottie </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION> and Other Dependencies, on Tuesday showed off the puppets her Detroit-based group uses to teach families the dangers of drug abuse. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Pogue </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> CompDrugs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, told the drug forum: `` What sells in this country right now is the notion that the drug problem is primarily a minority problem. `` It is much easier for this country to buy into the notion that it is a minority problem because then there is no compelling urge to do anything about it,'' <PERSON> Pogue </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> contended the drug issue has not been swept under the rug. `` I think that the whole issue of dealing with drugs is intimidating,'' he said. `` It has required that our community become consciously more aggressive in attacking that problem, because it is not an easy problem to attack, nor is it a safe one to become involved with. `` Now we are talking about our community developing relationships with the police and authorities that will ultimately lead to people getting locked up,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` That is contrary to the gentle nature of African-Americans toward each other and is really inconsistent with the value system that we have had about the extended family concept.'' Now, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said, blacks are seeing that `` the entire family must be more important than those persons who would violate the trust of the family.'' Secretary of Housing and Urban Development <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> brought up the subject of fairness, telling delegates Tuesday, `` We are going to be tough on drugs, but we are going to be tough for due process, too.'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, asked if due process protections were a major concern for the black community, said, `` I think it is a major concern that people do not be penalized because of someone in their families that might be using drugs that they had no control over. `` We do n't want to create a climate in which people just run roughshod through the -LRB- housing -RRB- projects eliminating people because they just look like they use drugs,'' he said. But <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, asked whether tight budgetary restrictions might harm the war against drugs, said: `` I do n't think it will be as tough for drugs as it will be for a lot of things. There are white Americans who are just as scared about what's happening with drugs as the black community.''

 One of the quirkier statistics presented at a convention of statisticians here indicates that men should get married, have children and get divorced if they want to be promoted on a university faculty. Another statistic concerned the sale of T-shirts, but it was less precise. Among more than 1,000 scholarly papers being presented at the joint meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Biometrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and the Institution of Mathematical Statisticians was one by <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Billard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, who studied promotion rates on college faculties. Here's what she found about the path of advancement from assistant to associate professor: _ Among those who were married but childless, 51 percent of the men and 41 percent of the women were promoted _ Among those who had spouses and children, 66 percent of the men and 51 percent of the women were promoted _ Among those who were single, divorced or widowed and childless, 53 percent of the men and 37 percent of the women were promoted _ Among those who were unmarried and had children, 80 percent of the men and 33 percent of the women were promoted Ms. <PERSON> Billard </PERSON>, in a paper reflecting the jargon of her industry -LRB- `` the standardized regression coefficients in the prediction equations for men and women'' -RRB-, drew no conclusions although the moral was clear: For male assistant professors, the way to get ahead is to get married, have children and get divorced. For women, that path leads to stagnation. As for T-shirts, vendor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuzzucoli </PERSON> said statisticians seemed to snap them up. A couple of hundred arrived at her table at 7:40 a.m. Tuesday and by 9 a.m. they were all sold, she said. They bore this legend: `` I'm Statistically Significant.'' Bumper stickers using a play on the statistical term `` moment,'' moved more slowly. `` Statisticians May Be Dull ... But We Have Our Moments.'' The annual August meeting filled two <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotels and brought together 4,215 statisticians to observe the 150th year of the ASA, which was founded in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and whose membership has included <ORGANIZATION> Florence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nightingale </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>. The meeting's youngest presenter of a paper was 16-year-old <PERSON> Nirmal </PERSON> <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugh </PERSON>, a junior at the <ORGANIZATION> Mahrishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. His topic was `` Multivariate vs. Univariate Time Series Forecasts of Weather Variables.'' He's an old hand at delivering papers, having previously done so before the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Neuroscience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. Outgoing ASA President <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, who heads the government's <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>, noted in a speech that her bureau used to draw moral conclusions from the numbers it gathered For example, she said, in 1888, studying the conditions of women workers, the bureau found that those living in rooming houses had to receive guests in their rooms because there was no other place. It concluded: `` Such a condition tends either in the direction of crushing out social intercourse, especially between the sexes, or of carrying it beyond the limit of prudence.''

<HEAD>Oliver North Begins Community Service in Anti-Drug Program</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> is beginning his service as a draftee in the war against narcotics by helping reformed drug dealers and other underworld figures to repay their crimes. The national security aide who directed some of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's boldest covert ventures abroad now will be plotting forays much nearer the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as five men calling themselves the `` New Pied Pipers'' attempt to clean up their old neighborhoods in the capital. North will `` most definitely'' be given a tour of the worst drug neighborhoods, but he wo n't be active on the streets, program coordinator <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` He's not a street-wise individual _ we know that. His element is administration.'' North, conscripted into the drug battle by the judge who sentenced him in the Iran-Contra trial, began his orientation Monday as a management adviser to Save Our Youth, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a private umbrella group for several anti-drug projects. He will focus, to start with, on the `` Pipers'' initiative. Under an arrangement with the court, <PERSON> North </PERSON> will work in the program about 16 hours a week for 75 weeks. Early last month, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> sentenced North to two years' probation, a $ 150,000 fine and 1,200 hours of community service for his conviction on three felony counts in the Iran-Contra case North is appealing his conviction, but told the court he was eager to begin the community work. North, in a two-hour get-acquainted meeting with program organizers, was `` very excited about his involvement,'' coordinator <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` He wanted to get to work right away.'' North initially was scheduled to return to the program's offices at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday afternoon, but <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the second session was postponed to avoid the glare of media attention. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> assigned <PERSON> North </PERSON> to the Save Our Youth program after the judge learned of the `` Pipers'' effort. The five men, all well-known in the drug community, will try to dissuade youngsters from using drugs and also will seek out dealers in efforts to give them legal employment, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Roach </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, a member of the Pipers who met with <PERSON> North </PERSON> on Monday, said he has no qualms about working with the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide. `` He's interesting ... and I think he was interested in us,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>. `` I think he will use his mind to help us develop solutions.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Staggers </PERSON>, chairman of Save Our Youth, said <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` represents one of the best minds in the nation when it comes to strategizing on how to attack problems.'' As a deputy on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff, <PERSON> North </PERSON> not only was a key figure in the secret sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> _ and diversion of profits to the Nicaraguan rebels _ but played a major role in planning the invasion of <LOCATION> Grenada </LOCATION>, the retaliatory bombing of <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and the interception of an Egyptian airliner carrying the hijackers of the <PERSON> Achille </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> cruise ship. Staggers and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s political image is a far cry from that favored by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s black community. But `` we're creating a marriage of two extremes,'' said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. `` The focus is not on our differences. The focus is on changing what is happening on our streets and to our young people. The young black man is self-destructive; he's becoming an endangered species,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. Under terms dictated by <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> can not act as a fundraiser, can not counsel young people, and can not give speeches or act as a spokesman for the group. Thus, <PERSON> North </PERSON> will `` serve as a advisor in the management and administration of SOY's activities,'' with his initial focus on the Pipers, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. `` He will stay in his element, and we'll stay in ours.''

<TEXT>
 A federal grand jury wants to examine documents from at least three groups that bought hundreds of copies of a book by former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> instead of paying him a speaking fee, the groups say. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused Tuesday to discuss the grand jury probe. But lawyers for <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> confirmed they received subpoenas requesting documents related to the book. A spokesman for Ocean Spray, a cranberry and citrus growers cooperative in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said the grand jury also was seeking documents from his group. Company spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> would n't discuss details of the subpoena, but he did say the group bought $ 2,000 worth of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s use <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigned this summer after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee accused him of trying to evade <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> limits on outside income through bulk sales of `` Reflections of a Public Man.'' He earned royalties of 55 percent on the book's sales. The House limits members' earnings from speaking engagements to 30 percent of the congressional salary, but royalties are exempt. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said the investigation appeared to be `` very routine.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said the agency's inquiry is continuing `` I ca n't comment on any aspect of the investigation, except I will confirm that it is ongoing,'' he said. <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spoke to Ocean Spray growers and management employees in November 1985. He said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s staff suggested that instead of giving the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker an honorarium, the cooperative could use the money to buy the books. `` As far as we were concerned, it was an honorarium in the form of a book purchase in place of a cash honorarium,'' <PERSON> Lawlor </PERSON> said. `` How he was to use them -LRB- the books -RRB- was for him to determine.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fly </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the school received a subpoena for documents relating to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 1984 speech there and the subsequent purchase of $ 3,000 worth of books Fly said the university had agreed to pay <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> $ 3,000. However, a <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> aide called after the speech to say the speaker had reached his limit on outside income and asked if he could use the money to buy copies of his book for the university, Fly said. `` We received about 504 copies of that book,'' Fly said. <PERSON> Laurene </PERSON> <PERSON> Janik </PERSON>, general counsel for the Realtors organization, said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> spoke to the group in April 1985. A $ 2,000 check was issued and voided, and the money was to be used to buy <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s book, she said However, the Realtors have no record of receiving copies of the book, Ms. <PERSON> Janik </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, never one to sit still for long, is traveling to his vacation home in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> next week by way of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It's a fairly common route,'' jokes spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 2,000 miles of backtracking en route to <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> is a political detour that <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> says will be just one of many upcoming campaign appearances by the president. In the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> instance, it's all in the family. The president will campaign for <PERSON> Ileana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ros-Lehtinen </PERSON>, the Republican nominee for the seat left vacant with the death in May of Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON>, a 36-year-old <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> real estate executive who has long been active in <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> politics, is the candidate's campaign manager. The president's appearance comes in advance of an Aug. 29 special election. Actually, there has been considerable political maneuvering lately in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s family _ both his official one and his personal one. But most of the movement entails declarations of non-candidacies. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for instance, is sending out signals that he's not interested in running for elective office after a stint as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s secretary of commerce _ preferring instead to spend time developing his business. And <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s oldest son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 43, an oilman and part owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> baseball team, announced he was more interested in the American League pennant race than running for <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> governor in 1990. He had been widely viewed as a likely contender before last week's announcement. About the same time, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, deputy to White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, announced he is abandoning the notion of a gubernatorial bid in his home state of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and will devote his time to his White House post. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> earlier took himself out of the 1990 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> race for the seat being vacated by the retiring Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, R-N. He said he hopes to serve <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for at least four years, preferably eight. But speculation continues to swirl around persistent rumors that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, may challenge Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, next year. The Sununus and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> have been on less than friendly terms recently. Meanwhile, presidential aide <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON>, who has served three <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> presidents, announced recently that he was resigning _ to return home to <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, spend more time with his family and serve as a political consultant. And what about reports that he may run for governor of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>? `` No plans at this time to run,'' <PERSON> Studdert </PERSON> says. However, he does n't hesitate to note that `` there are major economic structural challenges that face <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'' and to outline how he would approach them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, appears ready for his vacation, which starts a week from today and will last until Sept. 5. On Monday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was preparing to speak via telephone hookup to a town meeting in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and was chatting with the local host, Rep. <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., about their travel plans The preliminary conversation was piped into the White House press briefing room, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> that first lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was already in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>. `` We're going up next week,'' the president said enthusiastically. A case of the pre-vacation sillies may be setting at the White House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the other day jokingly told a group of photographers in the Oval Office: `` Do n't anybody take the ashtrays.'' And on Tuesday, he rushed into the White House press room brandishing a gag photo depicting him as an invisible leader _ and jokingly threatened to fire the top aides who sent it to him as a practical joke. The photo showed aides seated around <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s desk at the Oval Office, with his seat empty. It read: `` To President Skippy. From the gang that sees through you.'' It was a reference to the comic strip `` Doonesbury,'' and creator G.B. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s frequent depiction of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as invisible and references to an imaginary `` evil twin'' whom <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON> named Skippy. `` This is a vicious assault on my presidency,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made no secret that he's no fan of <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>, who was excluded from the invitation list when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited cartoonists to lunch last spring.

<HEAD>Sugar Industry Stockpiling Ammunition for Quota Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sugar industry is stockpiling statistics to throw into the fight to maintain import quotas that ward off foreign sugar and boost consumer prices at home. An industry study unveiled Tuesday said the sugar and allied corn-sweetener industries directly create 144,442 full-time jobs nationwide and pump almost $ 7.4 billion a year into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. `` It shows there is a lot more to this industry than the attacks that say it only benefits a handful of growers,'' <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Markwart </PERSON> said in making the study public. <PERSON> Markwart </PERSON> cited findings that, counting indirect effects, sugar and sweetener production generate $ 18.5 billion in wages and revenues, plus 361,000 jobs annually in 42 states. If there is a move to lift quotas as part of the 1990 farm bill, the survey is guaranteed to be used by the industry to offset claims that it represents only a narrow special interest. Because of the quotas, a pound of raw sugar that sells for 14 cents in world markets goes for about 24 cents in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That difference is passed on to consumers after the sugar is processed, packaged and sent to the grocery shelf. Consumer groups and industries such as soft drink and candy makers complain about the high cost of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sugar. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Agriculture Committees, however, have left the quotas intact. The two panels include members from major sugar-growing states and lawmakers reap hefty campaign contributions from growers. The survey also takes into account jobs and earnings generated by the corn-sweetener industry. Its products, used widely in soft drinks and various foods, trail sugar in price and the two industries are often allies. Lifting quotas would eventually scuttle not only beet and cane growers but sweetener manufacturing in this country, <PERSON> Markwart </PERSON> said. The survey said annual sugar and sweetener output totaling more than $ 7.3 billion a year is spread over many states. It said that the combined value topped $ 100 million in 17 states. The major corn states of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> headed the list of 17. Those two states, plus <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, were the leading corn-sweetener producers. Major cane states were <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> made the list principally as a refining site. Also among the 17 were the sugarbeet producing states of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. Among states on the list, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was notable for its diversified production. In employment, the agricultural side of the two industries contributes 115,268 jobs and the processing side 29,173, according to the study. It cited seven states with substantially higher employment totals than others: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, 11,057; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, 10,513; <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, 9,929; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, 9,890; <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, 9,731; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 8,907; and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, 8,889. The total includes farm workers involved in growing corn, even though economists are n't sure just what would happen to those jobs if sweetener production in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> halted. But the study said that, leaving out corn production, overall employment in the industries would total `` a highly creditable 75,411 full-time positions.'' Agricultural wages for corn and sugar totaled more than $ 1.2 billion nationwide, according to the study. Cane states had the highest overall payrolls, $ 159 million for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and $ 82.7 million for <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. On the processing side, wages came to more than $ 811 million. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> led the way with $ 118.5 million. Overall wages for growing and processing nationwide were just over $ 2 billion, the survey said. It said that sugar and sweetener business generates wages of $ 100 million a year or more in eight states: <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. Sugar industry critics are quick to point out not only the impact of quotas on the wallets of consumers but the other side of the employment story. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers also do not escape the adverse effects of this program,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> recently. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, the program's leading <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> critic, noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> refineries have been closing their doors and laying off workers because of high sugar prices. He said those costs are also hurting other industries. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food and beverage manufacturing industries employ hundreds of thousands of people,'' he said. `` The chocolate and confectionary industries alone employ more than 60,000 people. These jobs are threatened by competition from foreign manufacturers who have access to sugar at world market prices, not <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s inflated price.

 Farm machinery sales are expected to rise for the third year in a row, increasing from $ 6 billion in 1988 to as much as $ 6.7 billion in 1989, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Higher net cash incomes, lower real interest rates, rising farmland values and lowered agricultural debt are all trends that are contributing to expectations for a better year in tractor sales, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said demand for the more powerful tractors is especially strong thus far in 1989. Sales of 139-plus horsepower, two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive tractors are expected to climb 23 percent and 65 percent respectively.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> says it ca n't locate the files of a former housing official whose conduct is under scrutiny in the influence-peddling probe, but the former official says he does n't have them. `` I do n't even know where they are kept, much less take them with me,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said Tuesday, adding that he took no files when he left <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> last year. `` I do n't have them.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafferty </PERSON>, deputy assistant secretary for public affairs at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` He may have taken them with him _ we do n't have them here.'' However, he said the department has no evidence that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> took the files. `` They could be someplace that we do n't now know about but they are not in the typical places that you would look for them,'' <PERSON> Lafferty </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials realized the files were missing after receiving a Freedom of Information Act request for access to them. The files of two other former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials _ Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and his top aide <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> _ have provided dramatic insight into their activities at the agency. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in May that he had no direct role in funding decisions. Since then, however, a number of news accounts have detailed <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s personal intervention in several <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects, and his files offer further evidence that he was more involved in some decisions than he indicated in his congressional testimony. Ms. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s files show that she was often contacted by developers and consultants seeking <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> approval for projects and often gave proposals her endorsement although her job carried no official funding authority. For two years <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for housing, a powerful position that has jurisdiction over many of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s subsidy programs The report that sparked the congressional and internal investigations of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> focused heavily on <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s conduct. That report, by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, questioned the selection process used to award lucrative rehabilitation subsidies and said many of those who benefited were contributors to a charity <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> helped establish. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> concluded that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> committed no criminal offenses but said that prominent Republicans and former agency officials appeared to get special treatment from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which reviewed the report to determine whether <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> violated <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s standards of conduct, said last month it would not prosecute him. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> also was in charge of another program that was the subject of a critical audit by the inspector general. That report said <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> awarded emergency <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding to a number of projects that were n't eligible. Several qualified projects that did n't receive funding later went under and were taken over by the government, the report said. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> review of the program found that developers of projects that got emergency funding although auditors said they did n't qualify included a former business associate and several donors to his pet charity. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, in a recent interview, said he made the awards `` on the merits'' and questioned the audit's assertion that many of the projects were n't eligible.

<HEAD>Safety Board Trying to Increase Safety of Small School Buses</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> wants to find the best way to protect children who ride in small school buses that do n't have to meet standards set for larger buses. The board Tuesday sent a report on school bus safety back to its staff for revisions after failing to resolve issues involving the use of seat belts and the design of front-seat barriers in buses that carry 10 to 24 passengers. The staff wanted to conduct crash tests, but the four board members at the meeting refused to adopt that recommendation. Acting chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said the small number of fatalities in small school buses _ an average of two or three a year with 41,000 buses on the road _ did n't justify the testing. `` I think the parents of this country can be reassured that their children are by and large safe on these small school buses,'' <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said after the board spent three hours discussing the proposals it eventually declined to adopt. The recommendations, drawn from a study of 24 bus crashes, called for tougher rollover standards, improved joint design, more secure door latches and strengthened windshields. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Stack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> safety specialist, said federal standards for seat spacing, barrier padding and other safety features required for large buses do n't apply to the smallest school buses. Use of the small buses has increased in urban areas, where they often serve handicapped or specialized students, she said. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> said he hopes to call another board meeting within a few weeks to adopt the report and resolve the issues of front-seat barriers and lap belts. <PERSON> Kolstad </PERSON> characterized all the safety recommendations as `` relatively minor'' and said school buses remain one of the safest forms of transportation. Large buses are somewhat safer than small ones, he said. The report follows an <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> study two years ago on larger school buses that concluded the vehicles generally are safe. It recommended against installation of seat belts because federal standards require that seats be designed to form a padded compartment around young riders. All small Type A buses, which include vans converted to carry pupils, already have lap belts for each passenger but do n't follow rules for compartmentalizing the youngsters. The draft report recommended crash tests to determine the safety of various barrier designs with both restrained and unbelted passengers in Type A buses. Barriers in front of the first row of seats in small school buses generally were inferior to those in large buses, the report said. In several cases studied, the report said, passengers were thrown into the front of the bus where they were injured. In one instance, two children sitting in a front seat were killed _ one who wore a lap belt rammed his head into the barrier, and the other who was not wearing a belt was thrown through the barrier. The report said restraining barriers sometimes came loose during crashes, moving into the passenger area and exposing sharp edges that caused injuries. The draft also called for a study of the possibility of requiring lap-shoulder belts or other restraining systems for all passengers in Type A buses. Board member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, who was not at the meeting, said he favored adopting the staff report as drafted. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said that although school buses provide a highly safe form of transportation, `` the security of schoolchildren remains a major public safety concern.''

 The decade began with their creation and, if all goes according to plan, it will end with their demobilization. As the clock runs out on the Nicaraguan Contras, they have fallen short of achieving their principal goal but can still point to some successes. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration tried Tuesday to put the best face on a Central American plan to dismantle the Contras by Dec. 5, pointing out the rebels are under no obligation to do anything unless `` safe, democratic conditions'' are established in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> permitting their voluntary return. The administration would have much preferred that the Contras stay together in their camps along the Honduran border until after the Feb. 25, 1990, elections, serving as an incentive for the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> to carry out a fair election process in the interim. But even if the Contras manage to survive their Dec. 8 death sentence, there is almost no possibility they will ever again be a major factor shaping the destiny of their homeland or of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> itself. Not much has gone right for them since President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed legislation in October 1986 providing the Contras $ 100 million in economic and military aid: _ Less than a month later the Iran-Contra scandal claimed two of their most ardent backers in the administration, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> and National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> Another setback occurred with the death in early 1987 of another stalwart supporter, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>. _ In August 1987 the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> peace agreement was signed, requiring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end its support for the Contras This considerably strengthened the hand of the anti-Contra bloc in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. _ In February 1988 the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected an administration request for additional aid for the Contras Soon after, an informal cease-fire was agreed to in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, and the Contra exodus to the base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> began. Since then there has been no serious discussion of resuming aid to the Contras. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> made clear his sentiments last March when he declared the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's policy toward the Contras a failure. The Contras are feeling even more abandoned following the Central American summit earlier this week in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The meeting was preceded by an agreement by President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal opposition declaring that the time had come for the Contras to go home in peace. Previously, the Contras and opposition parties enjoyed an informal alliance, viewing each other as partners in their quest to remove the Sandinistas from power. The opposition's disassociation from the Contras made it easier for the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents to set their December timetable for the rebels' demobilization. Appeals from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration for a less ambitious deadline were ignored. The rebels are now reduced to ragtag status in the border camps, and their remaining backers in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are reduced to no more than a diehard few here and there. But there are those who recall with nostalgia the Contras' heyday and with trepidation the what-might-have-beens in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> One former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official insists the Contras made more of a contribution to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests than <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and other critics give them credit for: _ They were such a nuisance that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> had to forgo efforts to carry out subversion elsewhere in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, enabling these countries to get a start on establishing democratic systems All still have elected presidents. _ It was primarily because of the Contra military threat that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> agreed to sign the 1987 peace agreement in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> At that meeting, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> won support from other governments in the region for an end to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras but also made unprecedented commitments to bring democracy to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Although the Sandinista performance in carrying out these commitments has not been perfect, the country has not turned into what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration feared most _ an expansionist, totalitarian one-party state modeled after <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s `` rhetoric is right'' on civil rights, say <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> leaders, but they plan to wait a year to see how it turns out in practice. `` I am willing to concede that the first six to eight months is the rhetoric period'' in judging a new administration, Urban League President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address Tuesday. `` We will use the next 12 months to determine how well he does in carrying that out. His rhetoric is right. He is saying the right things. Now we have to find out whether he is willing to do the right things,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, was scheduled to address the concluding session of the conference today. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the first president to address an <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> conference since President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1979, received generous applause as he pledged that his administration `` will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry or bias of any kind.'' But <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokley </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I would have felt a lot more comfortable if the president had addressed the recent rulings of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, especially those that deal with affirmative action.'' Recent decisions of the court have held that state and local governments generally may not impose racial quotas for public works hiring, that minorities must meet higher statistical standards to prove they are being relegated to less desirable jobs, and that white workers not involved in an 8-year-old affirmative action ruling were nevertheless entitled to attack it in court. `` No matter what he says his moral and philosophical conviction is ... at this point I have n't heard him say anything about the laws in this country that were designed to protect blacks, women and other minorities,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tokley </PERSON> said. `` And until he does, I will not be convinced that he actually means what he says.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> judge attending the conference, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address `` was a very neutral talk as far as minorities were concerned.'' `` I do n't know that I expect him to be on our side,'' <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said. `` I'd be happy if he is n't against us. And at least I did n't get the sense that he's against us, and that's a plus.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the delegates the gulf between white and black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has narrowed, but has not been closed. `` Closing that gulf _ eliminating it for all time _ is the next chapter we must write in the unfolding history, the unfinished history, of civil rights,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He conceded that he and civil rights leaders have disagreed about how to accomplish that. `` We've argued _ society's argued _ about affirmative action, about quotas, goals and timetables, about set-asides,'' he said. But the most important point, the president said, is that `` bigotry and bias may take more subtle forms -LRB- than in the past -RRB- but they persist _ and as long as they do, our work is not over.''

<HEAD>Woman Nearly Embalmed Had No Pulse, Home Operator Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An 87-year-old woman who regained consciousness as she was about to be embalmed showed no signs of life before she was taken to the funeral home, a boarding home operator said. `` The lady died away for a while and later came back to,'' said <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>. `` The lady was laying there. She had no pulse, no blood pressure, nothing. She was just gone.'' Ms. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> did not say whether <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> was pronounced dead by a physician before she was taken to the funeral home on Saturday, and she refused to answer additional questions. Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON>, whose murmuring startled a mortician preparing to embalm her, was listed in fair condition Tuesday at Mercy Medical Center. She was taken to the hospital after she was found to be alive. `` She has no recall of what happened to her Saturday evening,'' <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>, vice president of medical services at the hospital, said at a news conference. `` It's kind of like a black period.'' He said her memory otherwise seems to be unaffected and that she appears to be `` cheerful and happy.'' He said Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON>, who is blind, may be released from the hospital as early as Friday and plans to live with a niece. Hospital officials turned down reporters' requests to interview Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON>. `` To me, it's a horrendous ordeal she's been through,'' said <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>. The incident is under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, according to Dr. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Klitch </PERSON>, chief of the department's bureau of medical services Ms. <PERSON> Klitch </PERSON> said the state could seek a court injunction to end operation of the home, ask <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to remove residents and pursue criminal charges. She said the department cited the home last April for several structural deficiencies, such as unsafe handrails. She indicated that some of the problems have been corrected. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> said he has talked with about five physicians who have cared for Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> in the past and none said they were contacted Saturday evening about the apparent death. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, director of the <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> Funeral Home, said he was called by the home Saturday about 8:30 p.m. and asked to pick up a body. When he arrived, Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON> was slumped in a chair. `` She actually appeared to be dead,'' he said. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said the woman was placed in a pouch, which was zipped and then placed on a cot. The cot was loaded into <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>'s vehicle, and he drove back to the funeral home, arriving about 8:45 p.m. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said he unzipped the pouch and prepared to move the woman to the embalming table when `` she uttered a sound.'' It was `` a very eerie feeling,'' he said. `` I was amazed.'' <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, 64, said there is no requirement that a death certificate be signed before a body is transported to a funeral home. He said he often fills out death certificates himself and then has them signed by physicians. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> <PERSON> Junk </PERSON>, an inspector for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embalmers </ORGANIZATION> and Funeral Directors, the state agency that licenses funeral homes, said a funeral director must know that a coroner or licensed physician will sign a death certificate before a body can be transported to a funeral home. He also said the family of the deceased must give permission before the body can be embalmed. <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Stringfellow </PERSON>'s family had given permission

 As many as 14 million families could be forced into homelessness by a mild recession in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, according to a study. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affordable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said public efforts to help the homeless rely are badly underfinanced, uncoordinated and are conducted by officials often unaware of the resources available to them.

Estimates on the current number of homeless people range between 655,000 to 4 million, but the total is growing 20 percent to 40 percent annually, the study said.

<HEAD>Broadway Revival of `Shenandoah' Opens</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The songs sound better the second time around in the Broadway revival of `` Shenandoah,'' and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cullum </PERSON>, returning in the starring role, is just as good as he was when he won a 1975 Tony Award. The homespun anti-war musical opened Tuesday at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Theater with a cast boasting a larger percentage of very good voices than most Broadway musicals. <PERSON> Cullum </PERSON>'s fine voice is n't as effortless as it once was, but the September that has entered it improves his ability to convey the widower <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>'s deep love for his family. `` Shenandoah'' originally opened Jan. 7, 1975, at Broadway's Alvin Theater and ran for 1,050 performances The revival, which first played in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, is scheduled through Sept. 2, with an extension considered. The story is based on the 1965 movie of the same name which starred <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. It tells of a father, six sons, daughter and daughter-in-law who live and farm together in the <ORGANIZATION> Shenandoah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> during the Civil War. Undertakers are the only winners in a war, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> believes, and he keeps his family neutral. But the war wo n't leave them alone. A corny moment, as <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> tells his prospective son-in-law that women sometimes get angry when husbands do n't do things the women have n't asked them to do, is bearable because it's comic relief against tragedies the audience knows must come in Act. 2. `` Shenandoah'' is sentimental, too, but focusing on individuals in one family makes the sentiment meaningful, not shallow. The songs are a cross between the wholesome <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hammerstein </PERSON> style and ballads written for somebody like <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. There's an anthem, `` Freedom''; a lullaby, `` Papa's Gon na Make It Alright''; the up-tempo `` Next to Lovin' -LRB- I Like Fightin' -RRB-'' for the five grown sons, and `` The Only Home I Know,'' an Irish-sounding tune sung by Irish tenor <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Simms </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was the daughter of the house, displaying a voice that would fit perfectly in `` Me and My Girl.'' Other principals were <PERSON> Camilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, the daughter-in-law; <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> and <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, the grown sons; <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimbler </PERSON>, the young son; <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, his slave friend, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavanagh </PERSON>, the son-in-law. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Geld </PERSON> wrote music and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Udell </PERSON> wrote lyrics. Their first Broadway show was `` Purlie.'' The book was by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Udell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, based on <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>'s screenplay. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> directed the revival and the original.

The newspaper also said that some high officials, whom it did not identify, were cautioning that only `` irregularities'' that need explanation had been discovered, not evidence of spying. `` No charges have been made against him at this point,'' spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told reporters at a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing Tuesday. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, suspected of selling secrets to the Soviet bloc while serving with the <ORGANIZATION> 690th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, has been restricted to <ORGANIZATION> Kelley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> while the investigation is conducted. The restriction began last week after he returned from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he could n't comment to queries that <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> is n't cooperating with the investigation He did say, however, that no hearing has been scheduled. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> was head of engineering and installation at the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s electronic security wing at the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Templehof Central Airport. The unit collects intelligence on <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact radar and communications. <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, speaking privately, said the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> found uncashed paychecks, evidence of bank accounts totaling more than $ 120,000, photographs of Western military installations and other classified documents in <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> came under suspicion during the routine review of his security clearance, reportedly after he failed a lie detector test. Lt. <PERSON> Erlinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a public affairs officer with the <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the command works on communications and electronic combat capabilities, including ways the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> protects its radar from being jammed. <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, 33, lists <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, as his home and has been with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> since 1979, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

 The opposition imposed an embarrassing delay Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation of <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second new prime minister in a little over two months <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, who was elected Tuesday to head the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was approved by the more powerful lower house, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then voted for <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>. It was the first time in 41 years that the two houses disagreed on who should take power. Delegates from the two chambers were to meet in conference later in the day to go through the motions of finding a compromise. If they fail, as expected, under the constitution the lower house victor prevails. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, called the delay a `` severe consequence of our election defeat.'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is succeeding <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who decided to step down after the Liberal Democrats were thrashed in the July 23 election for half the seats in the upper house of the Diet, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s parliament. The party lost its majority in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for the first time since it was formed in 1955, but still commands the lower house. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> met and resigned en masse, clearing the way for <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> to form a new government to try to win back the public approval that the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have lost in a succession of scandals and unpopular policies. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> pledged to restore public trust after a year of scandal and unpopular policies that caused voters to turn on the governing party for the first time since it was formed. `` I am painfully aware of the weight of my responsibility,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told a news conference Tuesday. `` We have been reborn and we must forge ahead. We must carry out political reforms and shed our old skin.'' A secret ballot of Liberal Democratic members of parliament and state-level party leaders resulted in 279 votes for <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 120 for former Welfare Minister <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> and 48 for <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishihara </PERSON>, a novelist and former transport minister. The upper house elections cost the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> their majority for the first time since the party was formed in 1955. General elections for the more powerful lower house must be called by next July. On Tuesday night, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> met with other party officials to decide on a new Cabinet and party leadership, a delicate task of balancing key jobs among rival party factions in the party. He succeeds <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who was plagued by reports that he kept paid mistresses. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> resigned to take responsibility for the loss of the upper house elections, attributed to the sex and money scandals and a 3 percent sales tax that outraged housewives. Uno had replaced <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who stepped down June 2 to take responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> influence-buying scandal, which reached the top levels of politics, business and the bureaucracy. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> chose <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, one of the few ranking politicians untouched by the Recruit scandal, as his successor but <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> was selected by the first party election in 17 years. Despite the election, many still see <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s candidacy as a product of backroom politics. He has no personal power base and is viewed as unlikely to stand in the way of more senior leaders temporarily blocked from the prime ministry by the Recruit scandal. How long <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> will serve is not clear. His term as party president is only three months, until the end of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s original term, but he could be elected to another Before Tuesday's vote, candidate <PERSON> Hayashi </PERSON> said: `` I read in the newspaper this morning that the election was already decided. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidential election is not subject to the Public Election Law, but if it were, it would be violating the rules.'' Opposition parties accused the Liberal Democrats of continuing politics in the old style. `` As always, it was secret factional politics,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which made the greatest gains in the upper house elections. `` There is simply no change. It's just what has been done all along: they're changing a book's cover without changing its contents.'' An editorial in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> said maneuvering within the party `` blatantly reflects a design to sustain a system of leadership monopolized by the mainstream factions.'' `` The starting point for <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is to grapple with the issues that were brought to light in the presidential election and to change what should be changed,'' it said. `` Otherwise, his election by vote will prove to be a farce.'' In pledging to change the system, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told the news conference Tuesday: `` In various ways, factions have had an evil influence, but just saying that they are bad wo n't make them go away.'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> lacks experience in foreign and financial affairs, does not lead his own faction and has never served in a top party post. He was the youngest member of Parliament when elected at age 29 and predicted at the time he would become prime minister in another 29 years.

 Consumers have had it with commercials on the videocassettes they rent, even as more car and soft-drink spots are being spliced onto movie tapes. Sixty-six percent of VCR owners said they fast-forward through commercials at the beginning of rented movies, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> study released Tuesday at the eighth annual Video Software Dealers Association convention. The study further found that more than 60 percent of those surveyed said they zip through coming attractions. Despite the renters' unhappiness, though, the commercials wo n't be going away anytime soon <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> Home Videos' upcoming release of `` The Land Before Time'' will carry a Pizza Hut pitch. `` Rain Man'' features a Buick plug, `` A Fish Called Wanda'' hypes Schweppes and `` Young Guns'' hawks <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION>. And a number of promoters have created a ruckus at this year's convention by offering to open prerecorded cassettes and attach commercials for local merchants Video Air Time of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, will put spots for florists, bowling alleys, attorneys and department stores on any cassette where there's room. `` We're offering the video store owner an additional source of revenue,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for franchising. `` The video store owns the cassette. And if we do n't make an unauthorized infringement of the copyrighted material, we have violated no law. Video Air Time charges about $ 20 per commercial per cassette, of which the store owner receives about $ 1 a tape. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> has filed a $ 1 million lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Video </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, alleging that the company has placed commercials on `` <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> Cop II,'' `` Raiders of the Lost Ark,'' and `` <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> Raw'' in some markets. Paramount argues that low-budget local commercials damage the studio's image. Paramount was the first studio to place a commercial on a major studio release, adding a Diet Pepsi pitch to `` Top Gun'' in 1986. Like that slick spot, many commercials on major studio releases are well-produced, often superior to spots for the same product running on television. The disapproval rate reflected in the new <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> study comes as a major reversal from a <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> study released in April. That survey showed that 95 percent of households renting the `` A Fish Called Wanda'' video watched the Schweppes commercial. Some home video executives have predicted that more than half of all video releases will contain commercials in the near future. Besides its findings on fast-forwarding commercials, the new <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> study showed that although video rental volume continues to grow, customers are looking for other ways to spend time, including other leisure activities, business or education, or regular television. The Nielsen inquiry also found that renters by a wide majority do n't want to pay higher rental fees for newer films.

 An anti-abortion candidate held a narrow lead Tuesday among Republicans in the first state election since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling giving states more authority to limit abortions. With 29 percent of the precincts reporting, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION> was leading with 6,140 votes to 5,129 for <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival <PERSON> Tricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 36, of <LOCATION> Bonita </LOCATION>, the only pro-choice Republican on the ballot in the heavily <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> district in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> counties, <PERSON> Jeannine </PERSON> <PERSON> Correia </PERSON>, an instructor for the developmentally disabled from <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION>, was leading the Democrats in early returns with 1,508 votes to 729 for <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>. Due largely to the abortion issue, the unusual special election to fill an empty Assembly seat managed to overcome the summer doldrums. Voters in the 76th Assembly District in northeast <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and southwest <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> were picking a successor to GOP Assemblyman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who died of cancer June 1. The likely outcome was that one of the six Republicans and one of the two Democrats would meet in a runoff general election on Oct. 3, when the Republican would be the huge favorite in the GOP-dominated district. One candidate would have to win more than 50 percent of the vote in Tuesday's special primary to win the seat outright. The other Republican candidates were <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brannon </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, 69, of <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Koolhaas </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>. Although major local issues include crime, taxes and population growth, national attention has focused on the abortion question. Both pro-choice and anti-abortion advocates say the election is the first for a state office since the high court's July 3 ruling in the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case. The only pro-choice Republican is <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, a registered nurse who is director of surgical services at <ORGANIZATION> Chula </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and president of the state Board of Registered Nursing. The Democrats, <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> mental health worker, and <PERSON> Correia </PERSON>, are also pro-choice. <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON>, a management consultant; <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> police lieutenant; and <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a retired appliance store owner, are strongly anti-abortion and opposed to state funding of Medi-Cal abortions. <PERSON> Koolhaas </PERSON>, an aide to state Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Craven </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Brannon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Poway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member and deputy mayor, also oppose state funding but tend to sidestep questions on the legality of abortions.

 The district sprawls over the desert area of the two counties, extending into the populated areas of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marcos </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION>, Alpine and <LOCATION> Bonita </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> area has 65,439 registered voters, while <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has 173,541. The district is overwhelmingly Republican _ 54.2 percent to 32.7 percent Democrat. All 10 candidates appeared on the ballot together, regardless of party and voters could pick whomever they wanted. In the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> expanded state authority over abortions. Current state law and state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings protect women's abortion rights and require the state to pay for poor women's abortions. But groups on both sides of the issue focused on the race.

 The Soviets were listening and journalists had reported for weeks on <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s payload, so why did military and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials go to the trouble of keeping the launch time and other details secret? `` By being inexact about the launch time, it complicates their ability to track,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said of the Soviets. `` They may or may not listen in, but we're going to do everything we can to keep the payload anonymous.'' But scientists who attended Tuesday's launch of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth shuttle mission said the military shroud wo n't stop the Soviets from finding out all about the reconnaissance satellite <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and its five astronauts are believed to be launching `` There's no reason I can think of for the secrecy,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>, a space analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientists </ORGANIZATION>. `` In principle, they could run this countdown like they run every countdown _ maybe this way it's more fun for them.'' The Soviets will shoot pictures of the satellite even before the device begins functioning, said <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>. Soviet cameras attached to a telescope can give a resolution as small as one foot. `` If they launch the satellite this morning, the Soviets will certainly know what it looks like by tonight,'' he said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> lifted its news blackout only briefly, announcing the launch time nine minutes before blastoff and reporting a trouble-free ascent into orbit shortly afterward. Nevertheless, a Soviet trawler bristling with antennas monitored the launch from less than 50 miles off <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. Reporters _ and probably the Soviets _ listened in on <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s internal communications channel to follow the countdown. The Soviet trawler and anyone else with a radar system could track <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> as soon as it left the launch pad, but <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> refused to tell reporters where the solid rocket boosters fell, saying that could help determine the shuttle's trajectory. The military clampdown on the mission was n't airtight, though. The shuttle crew, which always boards about 2 -LCB- hours before the scheduled launch time, was trucked out to the pad in the early morning illuminated by a spotlight and accompanied by a helicopter escort as well-wishers waved and camera crews filmed. Inside the Kennedy Space Center media room, space experts generally agreed the 20,600-pound satellite would spy on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> with highly sensitive camera lenses and infrared sensors from 300 miles up. `` If it's a high inclination -LRB- on takeoff -RRB-, it's going over <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and it's going to do some kind of sensing,'' said <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolcum </PERSON> of the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Space Technology, which often gives details of secret satellites prior to launch. Indeed, the shuttle took off on a north-northeast course that would take it over <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and parts of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Non-military shuttle missions normally take an eastward path. Besides tracking <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s launch, the Soviets will be able to intercept the satellite's emissions, <PERSON> Kolcum </PERSON> said. The experts also agreed <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> carried a second small payload _ a 275-pound instrument package apparently intended for use in the Strategic Defense Initiative program, according to Aviation Week. `` We've been after them for years to change _ there's no reason we can think of for keeping it secret,'' <PERSON> Kolcum </PERSON> said. Although <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> would like shuttle flights to get the maximum amount of publicity, the agency must please the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, which has switched some of its launches to unmanned rockets in the wake of the Challenger disaster. `` If secrecy's judged by them to be in the nation's interest, I'm for it,'' said <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, deputy administrator of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s gag on the mission may irk journalists and some <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> supporters, but the Soviets appear to empathize with the secrecy. Asked about the launch of a spy satellite over his territory, a Soviet Embassy press spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said only, `` We do n't comment on such matters.

<HEAD>Court Lifts Abortion Ban After Learning Woman Already Had Procedure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> woman defied a court order obtained by her former boyfriend and had an abortion, but the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously to lift the restriction anyway. The case of <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>, 21, was the latest and most dramatic in a series this summer that brought attention to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s lack of a federal abortion law. In ruling Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said it would give its reasons later for lifting the injunction obtained July 7 by Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>'s ex-boyfriend, 25-year-old <PERSON> Jean-Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON>, a former nightclub bouncer, and Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> briefly lived together in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> before breaking up. The court's nine justices had returned from vacation for an emergency session in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> Tuesday believing that Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> was entering the 23rd week of pregnancy and could not wait much longer for the case to be resolved. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedard </PERSON>, who evidently had been unaware that Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> went ahead with the abortion, told the court about it in the middle of the session. `` The attorney general of Quebec informed me they suspected my client of having proceeded to have an abortion,'' <PERSON> Bedard </PERSON> said. `` I have checked this and it is true.'' <PERSON> Bedard </PERSON> did not say when or where his client had the abortion. He apologized to the court but asked for the case to be heard because Ms. <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON>, a secretary, still could face contempt charges that carry a two-year prison term and $ 42,500 fine. <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON> also heard the news in court and told reporters: `` She just killed my child. I do n't know when _ today or last week.'' A spokesman for Quebec Justice Minister <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Remillard </PERSON> said police called his office Tuesday with details of the abortion from an informer. <PERSON> Remillard </PERSON> said there were `` good reasons to believe that <PERSON> Madame </PERSON> <PERSON> Daigle </PERSON> had an abortion a week ago,'' but he declined to say where. `` I do n't think it's opportune to talk about that,'' he said. Most doctors in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> will not perform abortions after the 20th week. Abortions are peformed in some parts of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until the 24th week and she hinted after an appeals court upheld the injunction on July 26 that she might cross the border for the procedure. She said later, however, that she would abide by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling. In fighting the injunction, she said <PERSON> Tremblay </PERSON> had abused her, and one time threw her to the ground and told her he would `` control and subdue'' her. One of her lawyers, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Decary </PERSON>, said the question of whether she still would be subject to contempt of court charges will not be answered until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> gives its reasons for overturning the injunction. About 350 anti-abortion demonstrators maintained a vigil outside the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> during the hearing. `` I am pretty appalled by the whole thing _ that she went out and killed her baby,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebick </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on the Status of Women, which supports the right to abortion, said: `` <PERSON> Chantal </PERSON> has been through the most incredible pressure. She clearly wanted to obey the law. `` But I ca n't imagine what it must have been like to know that the clock was ticking in terms of the deadline on that abortion.'' <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> lawyer, said the ruling has likely put an end to the use of injunctions to prevent women from getting abortions in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> and perhaps other parts of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. `` No more injunctions in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> from vindictive boyfriends,'' said <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON>, represents the <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has been without an abortion law since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in January 1988 that the existing law's stringent requirements for approval of an abortion infringed on a woman's rights The House of Commons failed to approve any of six proposed laws in July 1988. The outcome was that abortion was left a matter between a woman and her doctor. Last month, however, that premise was challenged by three provincial court cases, including Ms. <PERSON> Daigles </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> threw out an injunction obtained by a man claiming a father's right, and the woman went ahead with the abortion. In <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION>, a woman went ahead with the procedure after her former boyfriend failed to obtain an injunction. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> has said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will tackle the abortion issue this fall when it returns from its recess but will not be rushed into a decision. The federal government argued before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that abortion is `` within the exclusive legislative authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>'' and should not be a matter for provincial courts to decide. The court ruling came in response to <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s Court of Appeal, which voted 3-2 to uphold an injunction issued by <ORGANIZATION> Quebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court based its decision on the province's Charter of Human Rights. Justice <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernier </PERSON> wrote in the majority position that `` the child that has been conceived but not born is a reality that must be taken into account.''

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The withdrawal of his sole opponent leaves the way clear for former Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to return to City Hall for a third term. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, withdrew from the mayoral election Tuesday after polls showed he was far behind. That left the 51-year-old <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who served two four-year terms beginning in 1974, with no opposition. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, 41, who trailed by 34 percentage points in the polls, said he was stepping aside to ensure `` this campaign does not divide our city's family.'' He might have been able to win, <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> said, by hitting harder on crime, but `` the real casualty of that attack ... would have been the city ... It would have been too costly a victory.'' The rate of 176 crimes per 1,000 residents in this city of 445,000 is the nation's worst, according to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statistics released Monday. There are no other candidates; and if one announced, there would n't be enough time before the Oct. 3 election to mount a credible campaign, said <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> pollster <PERSON> Claibourne </PERSON> <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>. `` There's no time, no body and no money,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. `` You've got three no's. City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> hinted he might run simply to give <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> some opposition. `` It would be a tragedy to see <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> walk into City Hall. He ought to be challenged,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> a black Democrat, had cemented his populist appeal among the black majority with growing support from white businessmen. <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> ran as the more business-oriented candidate but failed to broaden his support. During his terms, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had often battled with businessmen, who have gotten along well with outgoing Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. `` There has been a change in attitudes. And a lot of the old guard is gone,'' said <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s press secretary. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> ads, in which he tried to link <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> with <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s crime rate, probably had little impact and forced <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> to drain his coffers. `` He took that high-risk technique of viciously attacking his opponent, and he found out why it's a high-risk strategy _ it does n't work most of the time,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said. `` That's the most important thing. He's broke.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, whose campaign featured a pledge not to allow a building boom to overrun neighborhoods, said the negative ads `` had very little effect on me.'' <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>'s withdrawal allows him to keep his job as commission chairman, which he would have been forced to give up by the Aug. 16 qualifying deadline. <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> includes about 90 percent of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s population, which is 61 percent black. Young, who can not seek a third consecutive term, said <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>'s decision to pull out `` probably relieves a lot of friends of both of them. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> claimed that <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON>, who worked for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in his previous administrations, always intended to drop out to prevent a candidate from running who was unacceptable to the `` black middle-class power structure.'' `` I have said from the beginning _ <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> would never face each other. This was only a political drama,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar slipped modestly against the Japanese yen Wednesday, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> firmed. The dollar closed at 138.85 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's close of 139.25 yen It opened at 138.72 yen and ranged between 138.40-139 .00 yen The Nikkei Stock Average for 225 selected issues gained 99.79 points, or 0.29 percent, closing at 34,859.27. On Tuesday, the index climbed 129.10 points. <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> trader <PERSON> Shinzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said majority of market players expect the dollar to move lower, and were reluctant to make major moves ahead of the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producer price index for July, scheduled for Friday. `` The dollar-yen rate is expected to back to the rate before the unemployment rate release last Friday,'' he said. Earlier last week, the dollar was moving in the 135-136 yen range but it went up after the lower-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jobless rate reported Friday. <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said investors in newly issued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bonds were buying the dollar to facilitate their purchases. On the stock market, dealers attributed the index's rise largely to the yen's upswing against the dollar and gains on overseas stock market during their trading overnight. The index's gain was inspired by rises in housing issues, said a dealer with a major securities firm, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 An Ariane rocket blasted into orbit from this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> space center carrying one satellite to map the position of stars and another for West German television. The Ariane 4 rocket lifted off Tuesday following a brief halt in the countdown seven seconds before launching so technicians could check out a problem in the rocket's guidance system. The launching followed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s successful liftoff earlier in the day Little is known about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission because its mission was to launch a spy satellite. It was the fifth <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle flight since September, when flights resumed following the 1986 Challenger disaster in which seven astronauts died. The Ariane program also experienced a break of some months following the failure of its 18th mission. Launches were resumed Sept. 16, 1987. Ariane 4's mission is the 33rd by <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION>, a partnership of 11 European countries and the world leader in the lucrative commercial launch field. Ariane 4, first flown June 15, 1988, is the latest version of the reliable rocket series developed under the aegis of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The rocket has six possible configurations tailored to individual payloads and is capable of carrying 4,190 pounds to 9,260 pounds into orbit. Tuesday's mission will carry a payload of 7,186 pounds into geostationary orbit, including the satellite Hipparcos, a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> mission dedicated to the precise measurement of the positions and motions of the stars. The second satellite is the TV-SAT-2 for the West German Bundespost telecommunications authority. The direct broadcasting satellite is to replace TV-SAT-1, which was abandoned in November 1987 after a failure in the deployment mechanism of its solar array. <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION>, which has international orders for 74 launches worth $ 2.3 billion, plans to send a rocket into space once a month between October and January. About 47 percent of the orders are for European projects, and the rest are for clients outside <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A priest blessed four sixth-century mosaics in a basement vault, where they will stay while an art collector appeals a court ruling giving the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> possession of the rare Byzantine works. The Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rousakis </PERSON>, pastor of Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, read from a prayer book and sang in Greek over the artworks lying on the basement vault's floor Tuesday. He sprinkled them with holy water, then he and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>, senior counsel for the Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, knelt and kissed each one. `` In the orthodox faith, the mosaics are sacred, a consecrated form of art that is part and parcel of our worship service. Once they are removed, it's almost as if they're stained or tainted. They have to be restored,'' <PERSON> Rousakis </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> ruled Thursday that art dealer <PERSON> Peg </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> had not obtained legal title to the mosaics when she purchased them for $ 1.2 million last summer in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> from <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dikmen </PERSON>, a Turk living in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The Republic of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the church sued Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> last spring to recover the works, which had been stripped from a church in Turkish-occupied northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1979. <PERSON> Noland </PERSON> ordered the mosaics returned to the Cypriots. Attorneys for both sides agreed Tuesday the artworks would be turned over to the Cypriots but must remain in the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> vault pending appeals. They may be removed only under a court order or agreement by both sides. `` Today is a great day for <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON>. `` Years of hard work in securing our artifacts, our cultural heritage, have not been wasted.'' Tuesday's prayers included one of forgiveness for <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> and those who took the mosaics from the church and smuggled them out of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island nation. `` We have learned to forgive people,'' <PERSON> Kyprianou </PERSON> said. `` What we wanted are our mosaics back.'' The mosaics, pieced together with painted glass about 525 A.D., are fragments of a much larger work on the ceiling of a church in northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The images of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> as a boy, the apostles <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and an archangel are among only a handful of icons surviving the first centuries of Christianity. Under Tuesday's agreement, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> controls the keys to the vault but will not move the mosaics or restore them during the appeals process unless <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> agrees. She must file an appeal of <PERSON> Noland </PERSON>'s decision within 14 days and must not seek delays during the appeals process. `` We very strongly intend to appeal. I just simply totally disagree with the decision,'' Ms. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said.

 An earthquake that broke windows and contributed to one death in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area could herald even stronger temblors along the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> fault, scientists say. `` The stress is building up in the earth and we're going to start getting large earthquakes,'' said <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, a geophysicist with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey in <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` It should serve as a reminder to prepare.'' The quake rolled for 10 seconds, shaking buildings and awakening residents but causing only minor damage, authorities said. `` I thought all my windows were going to break,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` My whole bed was shaking.'' It struck at 1:13 a.m. about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and had a magnitude of 5.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, according to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey. It was centered on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> fault about 15 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>. State earthquake experts and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning of increased risk and said another quake as high as 6.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale could strike <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in the next five days. `` It certainly shows us the fault is becoming more active,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who added that the quake was the largest in the area since 1969. Geologists said the chances of a bigger quake in the same spot diminished with each passing hour, however. The quake occurred as state and federal emergency services officials prepared to conduct a two-day test of their response to a catastrophic earthquake. <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, wife of Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> to attend the first day of the test. When she woke up at 5:30 a.m. and saw coverage of the actual earthquake on television, she thought it was part of the exercise. `` I thought, ` Gee, this is pretty interesting. They have the simulation on television already,''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION>, where the quake was centered, police reported that 19-year-old <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bignall </PERSON> jumped from his bedroom window after apparently being startled awake by the earthquake. <PERSON> Bignall </PERSON> died of multiple traumatic injuries, according to a spokeswoman with the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> coroner's office. His half-brother said <PERSON> Bignall </PERSON> had never experienced an earthquake. `` My brother was a sound sleeper,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Burger </PERSON>, who shared the apartment with <PERSON> Bignall </PERSON>. `` And I think the motion of the quake seemed so violent and disorienting that he just leaped out the window. He felt he had to get out, and I do n't think he knew what he was doing.'' Residents reported some broken windows and items falling off shelves but no major problems, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gatos </LOCATION> police dispatcher said. Damage was confined mostly to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> counties, according to the state <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. The quake was felt as far away as <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, about 230 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Residents of <LOCATION> Sonoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 60 miles to the north, also felt the temblor, according to the state agency. A moderate aftershock measuring 4.2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale struck at 1:44 a.m., followed by a second, stronger aftershock that measured 4.5 at 8:53 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> said. The open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Each increase of one number means a tenfold increase in ground motion. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a `` major'' earthquake, capable of widespread heavy damage; 8 is a `` great'' quake, capable of tremendous damage. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the scale.

 A police officer could have stopped the rape of a suspected prostitute without blowing his cover in a drug investigation, representatives of two women's organizations said. `` It does n't take a police badge to stop a rape,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashmore </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chapter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, which has called for the firing of Officer <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Echartea </PERSON>. `` I certainly would not be comfortable with a police officer watching over my security and welfare who let a rape happen.'' She said the organization will formally ask <ORGANIZATION> Groesbeck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> to fire Echartea, who said he pretended to be sick while three men he was investigating on drug charges raped the woman. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who has defended <PERSON> Echartea </PERSON>'s non-action, did not return phone calls Tuesday to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wanda </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a counselor at the Rape Crisis Center in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Echartea </PERSON>'s failure to do something was `` a crime in itself.'' `` If a crime is being committed, somebody should do something about it ... That's a decision all of us have to make,'' Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` You do n't want to ruin your credibility,'' <PERSON> Echartea </PERSON> told The Dallas Morning News. `` If it had been a life-threatening situation, I'd have blown my cover. I'd have had to. You just ca n't let someone be killed.'' <PERSON> Echartea </PERSON> said he included the rape in that day's report to his superiors. The officer who took the report could not be reached for comment. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> police said they will begin a criminal investigation and try to find the woman and ask if she wants to press charges. Detectives will also ask <PERSON> Echartea </PERSON> for a full account of what happened, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Deputy Chief <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. `` I think he had some obligation as one human being to another to help her as best he could,'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said. `` All women, even prostitutes, have a right not to be raped.'' <PERSON> Echartea </PERSON>'s investigation resulted in the arrests of four people on charges of selling drugs. He is an officer on the police force of <LOCATION> Groesbeck </LOCATION>, 85 miles south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said he did not know whether state law requires <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> police to intervene in felonies they observe. Echartea first recounted the incident publicly in an interview last week.

<HEAD>Arkansas Law Would Put Parents in Stockade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DERMOTT, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parents who fail to rein in their kids could be displayed in a public stockade under a city law that also sets a curfew for teen-agers. `` Until we introduce shame back in crime and punishment, we're spinning our wheels,'' City Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said The ordinance approved unanimously by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Monday was in response to a street fight Saturday night and an overall increase in crime during the summer in <PERSON> Dermott </PERSON>, a town of about 5,000 people. The fight involved about six youths and adults, and drew some 250 onlookers, Police Chief <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> said. The ordinance calls for delinquent parents to be fined up to $ 500 and jailed up to 30 days, `` within stockaded public display six hours a day'' during certain days of the sentence. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said he was unsure about the constitutionality of using a stockade. Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said he doubted it would occur because the city has no stockade. Parents who fail to abide by the new ordinance may also have their photograph placed in the local weekly newspaper for two weeks with a caption reading `` Irresponsible Parent.'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said but the burden of keeping youths out of trouble is on the parents. The ordinance calls for curfew for those younger than 18 from 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. Parents who ca n't control their children can sign a statement to that effect, in which case the minors will be considered delinquent and have their fate decided by the juvenile courts. Those parents will have to pay the city $ 100 for each minor so designated or render 20 hours of community service. The parents also would be required to display a bumper sticker on their vehicle saying: `` My children are not my responsibility. They are yours.''

 The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen for a second day today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s key index gained. The dollar closed at 138.85 yen, down 0.40 yen from Tuesday's finish of 139.25 yen It opened at 138.72 yen and ranged between 138.40 yen and 139.00 yen.

<HEAD>Teen Killed in Sporadic Rioting in Catholic West Belfast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Young <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters clashed with security forces on the anniversary of a defunct British policy of detaining people without trial, and a teen-ager was killed, police said. Two people were injured in related violence. Police said more than 20 people were arrested during disturbances that occurred in Roman Catholic areas of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> Tuesday night and continued early today. British news reports said a 15-year-old boy died after being struck by a plastic bullet fired by security troops trying to control young <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> supporters throwing gasoline bombs and stones and burning <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags. The Royal <PERSON> Ulster </PERSON> <PERSON> Constabulary </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force, would not comment on the incident. `` The death is being investigated,'' said a police spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. Crowds threw stones and gasoline bombs at police, and lighted bonfires and burned <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags, police said. A number of vehicles, including buses and cars, were hijacked and set on fire. On the northern outskirts of <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, gunmen burst into a home and injured a man and woman who had spotted them coming and barricaded themselves in a room, police said. The gunmen tried to batter down the barricade but failed and then fired a number of shots through it, hitting both people. They were hospitalized and reported in `` ill but stable'' condition. No group claimed responsibility. Rioting on the anniversary is an annual event although <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abandoned the policy of detaining people without trial in 1975. The violence also occurred amid heightened tension over the 20th anniversary next week of the deployment of British troops in the province. On Aug. 9, 1971, the British government introduced the policy for terrorist suspects in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In predawn raids that day, 342 people were arrested. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abandoned the policy in December 1975 following worldwide condemnation. But Irish <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> supporters, who were the main targets, continue to mark the anniversary with violent anti-British rallies. The mainly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. It wants to unite the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, whose population is 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> civil rights demonstrations in 1968 created a violent Protestant reaction, leading to the arrival of British troops who soon found themselves fighting the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>. In 1972, the government in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> closed the local parliament and took over direct rule of the province.

<HEAD>Incumbent Loses Mayoral Race in City Where Murder Rate Is Hot Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The incumbent lost but denied that his defeat in the mayoral primary had to do with <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statistics showing the area has the nation's highest murder rate. Mayor <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bays </PERSON> conceded victory to challenger <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who had 57.2 percent of the vote according to final returns Tuesday. The returns showed <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> had 8,684 votes to Bays' 6,506. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statistics released Monday showed the two-county <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> metropolitan area had the highest rate of murders per 100,000 residents among the nation's metropolitan areas. The statistics became a last-minute issue in the Democratic primary, where Bays and <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, a banker, were the only candidates. Bays did not elaborate about why he lost the primary, but called upon the city to support <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, who faces no Republican opposition in the Nov. 7 general election. Bays told voters Monday that the new <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statistics are misleading and that <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> hurt the city's image by capitalizing on the murder rate in his campaign. <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> replied: `` I've walked all over <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. People are concerned about crime and drug abuse.'' The FBI Uniform Crime Report said the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> area had 24.1 murders per 100,000 residents in 1988. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area was second with 22.7 per 100,000, a total of 3,577 murders compared to the <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> area's 29. The <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> area's population is 120,560, compared to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s 8.6 million. Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said 70 percent of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>'s murders could be attributed to drug abuse Police say crack has become pervasive in the city's poor neighborhoods. Bays, an accountant, was elected in 1986 to complete the term of former Mayor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, who died in office. Bays won his first full two-year term in 1987, when he ran unopposed.

 A friend of ex-U.S. Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>'s said he was guilty only of `` being in the wrong place and the wrong time'' after his conviction on fraud and racketeering charges in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> case. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer, was convicted Tuesday of illegally receiving $ 425,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other government officials in the company's bid for government contracts. A jury acquitted <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, 55, of a second racketeering conspiracy charge stemming from another $ 100,000 he was accused of taking from the company. The three-month trial in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> federal court was the sixth to result from the scandal at <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a defense contractor that closed after allegations of illegal activity were made public. After the verdict, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said he was a victim of `` prosecutorial contortions of the facts'' and would appeal. `` I am guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place and the wrong time,'' he said. Two co-defendants, one of whom also was linked to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, were convicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and fraud. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, who never was charged in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> scandal, testified that <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had never asked him to do anything improper for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, telling reporters: `` Nothing that happened here casts a single aspersion on that man.'' The former attorney general was en route to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, Tuesday night to give a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> and was unavailable for comment. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, once a small machine shop in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, grew into a $ 100 million government contractor through a federal program that set aside contracts for minority-controlled companies. Evidence at earlier trials showed that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> continued to get the no-bid contracts through bribe schemes even after it ceased to be a minority-owned company. The announcement of the verdict was interrupted for about 20 minutes when the mother of one of the defendants, <ORGANIZATION> R. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was overcome with emotion and had trouble breathing. Oxygen was brought to the courtroom for the woman, who lawyers said has had two heart attacks previously. The defendants were variously charged in a 21-count indictment with six separate schemes to defraud <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> or the government through false documents and bribery. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer who represented <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> during his confirmation hearings for attorney general and at a special prosecutor's investigation in 1984, was convicted of two acts of racketeering. One was defrauding <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> in September 1983 for $ 125,000 which he billed as work for the company's public stock offering but which prosecutors said was for his efforts to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and others to get an Army contract for <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. In the other act, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> was found to have illegally received $ 300,000 from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials, purportedly for helping the company acquire shipyards and a tug-barge system. The money was actually in anticipation of <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s employment at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> where he could influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and others, the jury found. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> also was convicted of one charge of conspiracy to defraud the government and two fraud charges stemming from the payments. He was acquitted of conspiring with <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to defraud <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> of $ 100,000 by covering up the payment to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s former financial adviser, and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a business associate of <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON>, were convicted of that charge, among others. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> faces up to 45 years in prison. <PERSON> Chinn </PERSON> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> could get up to 40 years on their two racketeering convictions and lesser sentences on the other charges. All three men also face fines and forfeitures when they are sentenced Oct. 16. Four former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> executives, including the company's former chairman, pleaded guilty to bribe - and theft-related charges in January 1987 and have testified at several trials, including a case that resulted in the conviction of former Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, on racketeering charges Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, is awaiting trial on charges that he extorted $ 185,000 in cash and a diamond and emerald necklace from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>.

 Social workers put a 9-year-old girl with AIDS in a foster home after a report that her mother had sexually abused her and punished her with drug injections. `` Everybody just wants to give her the best we can give her in the time she has,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, regional director of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. `` She is with the person she wants to be with and if that works out, there is no reason to move her.'' The girl is now in foster care with a family who knows her, and will likely remain in state custody until she dies, he said. State District Judge <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Rickhoff </PERSON> on Monday held a closed-door hearing about the girl, citing a law requiring confidentiality in AIDS cases. Her mother, a drug abuser, died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The youngster was left to live with relatives, but social workers became concerned that those surroundings were further endangering her life, and an emergency court order removed the girl and placed her in foster care. One of the issues believed to have been discussed in the Monday hearing was whether the child will attend public school. `` As far as we're concerned, she's going to go to school,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we have an obligation to tell the school -LRB- about the disease -RRB-. In fact, we may be precluded -LRB- by law -RRB- from telling them.''

 Americans across the country turned on porch lights and held candlelight marches and block parties in a neighborly show of unity against crime in the sixth annual National Night Out. `` We're trying to send a message to criminals that we're taking the streets back,'' said police Lt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wactor </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, where police and residents held a rally Tuesday in front of a building plagued by drug dealers. People from two communities in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> formed a human chain across a bridge to symbolize two neighborhoods uniting to fight crime. `` Most people want to be neighborly, but they need some excuse, some catalyst,'' said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Peskin </PERSON>, coordinator of the program for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It gives them something to do besides sitting on their porch.'' <PERSON> Peskin </PERSON>, who lives outside <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wynnewood </LOCATION>, said more organized events were held this year than last. By night's end, he expected 20.5 million Americans in more than 7,600 communities to participate, an increase of more than 2 million over last year's estimate Sponsors arranged to have the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s Defense Meteorological Satellite photograph the country to show the glow of porch lights. The <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> plans to give sponsors a composite picture of the event created by one pass of the satellite over the eastern <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at 9:30 p.m. and a photograph of the western half a few hours later. Police officers said they hoped the evening would involve residents in crime prevention by getting them to know their neighbors and to report crime when they see it. `` People can be our eyes and ears in the community, and they need to be,'' <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> Public Safety Director <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> said. `` Nobody has to tolerate illegal drugs in their community and no one has to tolerate violent crime.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director Williams Sessions turned on a giant light bulb in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, to kick off the event, which he called a `` symbol of solidarity and determination.''

<HEAD>Palmer Begins Forming Cabinet, Says He Will be Less `Exciting'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New Prime Minister <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> today began forming his Cabinet and said there would be no domestic or foreign policy changes under his administration. He also said his administration would be `` less exciting'' than that of his predecessor, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, who announced his resignation Monday for health reasons. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> caucus elected <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> prime minister on Tuesday and chose <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> to replace him as deputy prime minister. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a lawyer, says he pales in comparison to the colorful <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, who for five years captured world attention by arguing with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> over nuclear issues. <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s departure followed major economic change in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, a former British colony of 3.3 million in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, 47, promised to pursue the <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> vision of an independent <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. He also reiterated that there would be no change in the nation's anti-nuclear stance, which led to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships being banned from the nation's ports The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomed <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>'s appointment, noting he had spent considerable time in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as an academic. Asked at a news conference today if he was prepared to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> replied that he would meet anybody at any time. Earlier, he said: `` We want to have dialogue with the Americans.'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s resignation prompted tributes from around the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The prime minister of <LOCATION> Papua </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rabbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Namaliu </PERSON>, said he would miss <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>'s `` fearless dipolomacy.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> said that despite some policy disagreements, the men were friends. <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said history would judge <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s most effective prime minister so far. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, a former attorney general, said he would probably complete his Cabinet appointments by Friday. He also said he offered <PERSON> Lange </PERSON>, also a lawyer, the position of attorney general and that <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> had said he might consider the offer. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said it was certain he would have discussions with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador-designate <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> when she arrives in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> to take up her post. `` But diplomacy is best not conducted through loud speakers in the media,'' he said.

 Judges closed down a dump where a fire destroyed part of an interstate highway and officials said it could take as long as a year to reopen the busy commuter link.

<HEAD>Dallas Suburbs' Vote Could Derail $2.45 Billion Transit System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A suburban referendum on the metropolitan area's bus system could determine whether a long-delayed plan to build a light-rail mass transit system ever gets rolling Transit supporters fear a vote by five suburbs to withdraw from <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> bus service will derail a $ 2.45 billion plan to construct 66 miles of rail lines by 2010. The plan also calls for an 18-mile rail link connecting downtown to the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and 37 miles of bus and car pool lanes for suburban commuters. `` If this plan fails, it's going to set <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> back 10 to 15 years,'' said <PERSON> DART </PERSON> board member <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Clack </PERSON>. The transit authority approved the rail plan in June after six years of delays. Critics in the suburbs of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rowlett </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Coppell </PERSON> say the authority has taken too long already and that their bus service is not commensurate with the tax dollars they contribute to DART. They say widening roads and adding tollways would be cheaper than a rail system. `` There is a great mistrust of DART,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON>, who has worked against the rail plan. `` People feel there have been expenditures that have not been wise.'' `` Of course, we've always had our own cars and we like to drive up to our own spots. That kind of philosophy has been in place in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for years,'' <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> said. But that philosophy creates rush-hour gridlock on <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> freeways. Of more than 974,000 area residents, about 150,000 ride DART buses daily. DART estimates 214,000 riders will use the transit system once it is complete. DART spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> fears even more congested freeways if suburban bus service ends. `` You're going to put about 20,000 more drivers back on the roads,'' he said. `` That's scary.'' In 1983, voters approved a 1-cent sales tax to finance a $ 5.5 billion regional bus and rail network. A sagging economy forced the authority to scale back plans and ask voters last year to approve the issue of $ 1 billion in bonds to start rail construction. Voters in the 16 cities served by <PERSON> DART </PERSON> said no. Now DART officials see the Aug. 12 suburban referendums as crucial for the area's growth. `` This is not a vote on <PERSON> DART </PERSON>, it's a vote on regional transportation,'' said board member <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenne </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>. He believes corporations wo n't move to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> unless they're assured of regional transit. `` Maybe we can get by without mass transit for a couple of years,'' <PERSON> Clack </PERSON> said. `` But a little down the line, we're going to need one. You ca n't just snap your fingers and have it appear. You have to start now.''

 A bomb blast at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> today caused minor damage but no casualties, police said. The blast came at a time when the justice minister, <PERSON> Oltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sungurlu </PERSON>, has come under criticism from the opposition and press because of a 42-day-old hunger strike by 200 leftist inmates. No group claimed immediate responsibility for the bombing. Investigators said the explosive device was placed inside a garbage can in the ladies' room on the first floor of the ministry. The semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Anatolia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported police detained one person, but the report was not immediately confirmed. The explosion came a week after two leftist inmates died due to what officials said was dehydration from the hunger strike. Newspapers and other inmates said the men were beaten to death. The deaths came after they were transferred along with 280 fasting prisoners from <LOCATION> Eskisehir </LOCATION> province to a prison in <LOCATION> Aydin </LOCATION>, 300 miles west. The two inmates belonged to the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, a guerrilla group that is fighting for an independent state in the southeastern parts of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The inmates began a hunger strike at <LOCATION> Eskisehir </LOCATION> prison on June 28 to protest restrictions imposed by prison authorities after it was discovered that the inmates were trying to tunnel to freedom.

 The city's new daily newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to hit the streets Sept. 25, its owner says. `` We're right on budget and right on schedule,'' <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, the newspaper's chairman and editor in chief, said at a news conference Tuesday in the Sun's downtown newsroom overlooking the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and the Gateway Arch. The Sun, a morning tabloid, will cost 25 cents every day except Saturday when it will publish an expanded weekend edition that will sell for $ 1 and include two glossy magazines and advertising supplements. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, a newspaper owned by affiliates of the South Korean-based <ORGANIZATION> Unification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> headed by Rev. <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, was the last major metropolitan newspaper to be started in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It began in 1982. <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION>, N.J.-based <ORGANIZATION> Ingersoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said the Sun hopes to lead the way in the newspaper industry with its expanded Saturday edition. `` Changing lifestyles and workplace habits convince us that Saturday morning will continue to increase in importance as the prime time for weekend newspaper publication,'' he said. Ingersoll's publishing company owns 40 daily and 150 non-daily newpapers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and also publishes 14 papers in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The company employs 11,000 people. It also operates a chain of suburban newspapers in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area, which <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said has helped the Sun get started. The Sun will compete with the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Post-Dispatch </LOCATION>, which has operated alone in the city since 1986 when its longtime rival, the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Globe-Democrat </LOCATION>, folded. The <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> has a circulation of 371,000 during the week and 551,000 on Sunday.

He said he's not looking to pass the <PERSON> Post-Dispatch </PERSON> in circulation numbers. The new newspaper has hired about a third of its editorial staff and has trained its display advertising staff, which will begin selling ads soon, <PERSON> Ingersoll </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will refuse to start negotiations for a hostage or prisoner swap until it receives `` signs of life'' about three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held captive in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. `` As long as we do n't know who is alive and who is n't, we will discuss no other details,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said Tuesday night at a meeting of his <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier Tuesday, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told reporters after meeting <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> that confirming the Israelis were alive must be a first stage in contacts with <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> radicals believed to hold the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and most of the 16 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. As a second step, <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> added, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would provide the Shiites with information on the whereabouts of an estimated 300 of their followers imprisoned by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` Only then will we negotiate the terms for the exchange,'' he said. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> considers the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to be `` the most suitable'' channel for negotiating a swap with the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> movement, an umbrella organization for <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> fundamentalist groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> today claimed responsibility for a suicide car bomb attack in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that injured five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and a Lebanese militiaman. The two suicide car bombers died in the blast five miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> indicated there had been little progress made so far in resolving the hostage crisis, by saying, `` Unfortunately until this moment no Lebanese organization turned to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> with any proposal.'' `` Whoever wants real business, it's better to turn to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> with whatever terms he has in mind,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> after shuttling between <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> on the hostage situation, said his meeting with <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> focused on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> demands that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> release a Moslem cleric kidnapped by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> commandos from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on July 28. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> rejected the demand saying 33-year-old Sheikh <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> would be freed only as part of a swap for <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leader also differed with <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>'s assertion that <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s capture `` does not help'' efforts to free hostages. `` I believe the fact it was done provides a bigger chance to return the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers missing and the captives home,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. The three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers believed to be held by <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Rahamim </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alsheikh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Fink </PERSON>, who were captured in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in February 1986, and an air navigator, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, shot down while on a bombing mission near <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> in October 1986. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Alsheikh </PERSON>, the father of one of the Israeli prisoners held by the Shiites, was quoted today by the <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> daily as saying he learned 10 days ago `` for the first time that he -LRB- his son, Rahamim -RRB- is alive.'' `` That's what we were told.

 Scientists are hoping the microbes they tinkered with will vanish quickly after the nation's first open-air field test of a pesticide made of genetically engineered virus. Weather permitting, scientists from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Boyce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thompson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> intended to spray the virus today on a field of cabbage at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Agricultural Experiment Station. The test is designed to see if a genetically disabled virus will disappear from the environment quickly after attacking the insects it is aimed at destroying, rather than lingering in the field, said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, the virologist who will direct the test. `` It's a hurdle in terms of the genetic engineering of viruses and quite a significant step if it's successful,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` It would be a big step for biological control.'' The test could provide new ways to fight plant diseases and pests while lessening dependence on pesticides. About 3 billion pounds of pesticides are used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year. Scientists are aiming their test at the cabbage looper, a pale green caterpillar that attacks more than a dozen kinds of vegetables, including cabbage, beets, broccoli and cauliflower. The virus they are using is identical to naturally occurring strains known as baculoviruses, which can cause viral epidemics in many agricultural and forest insect pests. Researchers will remove a gene that provides a protective protein coat from the virus. Scientists eventually hope to splice a new gene into the virus, one that would make it more deadly to pests, <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. The new, more virulent virus could be sprayed onto plants, where it would kill pests and then die quickly. The field test will be conducted on a two-acre, doughnut-shaped plot containing 20,000 cabbage plants, of which 2,500 plants in the center will be sprayed with the virus. The plot will be monitored through 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> approved the field test in July after determining it posed no environmental or human health hazards. Several genetically altered bacteria have been tested before, but this is the first altered viral insecticide tested in the field, said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Betz </PERSON>, a biologist at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

Police and <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents said <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> has no apparent motive for stalking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He admitted that at some point he started hearing voices and that he has been following the president around the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> in an effort to get close enough to kill him,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON>, a robbery investigator with the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Authorities said <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> has a history of psychological problems and was investigated several years ago in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> after making threats against then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON>, believed to be from <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, said during interviews with authorities that he was in a crowd of about 4,000 people that attended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> enclave of <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> on April 17. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced economic incentives for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during the speech. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Huse </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> claimed he had been in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> the night before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech. `` He told agents he had picked out the perfect spot to shoot from but could n't reach it on speech day because of metal detectors,'' <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> said. `` He then ran to several areas trying to get close enough for a shot but before he could shoot, the president finished and left the podium.'' <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> had spoken of carrying guns including a .22 - caliber automatic pistol and a .380 - caliber automatic handgun, but it was n't clear what gun <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> had $ 1,400 when he was arrested Friday for robbing Gateway Savings in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> said. Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police said <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> said he needed the money to `` go back east and kill the president.'' <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> also told investigators he committed a spree of bank heists dating back to November 1986, beginning with a bank in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> said the other banks <PERSON> Daughetee </PERSON> admitted to robbing were in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Two of the banks, <ORGANIZATION> Gibraltar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, both in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, were robbed Friday before Gateway Savings.

<HEAD>U.N. Sources Say One Killed in Ammunition Dump Explosion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One man died after a rocket hit an ammunition dump, triggering explosions that lasted more than 3 -LCB- hours, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources said today. Relief workers said eight people were injured. The man, who lived about 500 yards from the dump in the <LOCATION> Khair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khana </LOCATION> district of northwest <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, was running from his house after the rocket hit at dusk Tuesday and ammunition and rockets in the dump started to explode, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said he expected to have information on the death later today. The Avicina emergency hospital, which acts as a coordinating center for casualties, reported five Tuesday after the dump started exploding. But today, doctors there said they knew of no dead or injured and that casualties might have been taken to military hospitals. Relief workers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said eight people suffered serious injuries in rocket attacks citywide Tuesday night, some in the <LOCATION> Khair </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khana </LOCATION> district. After intense rocket attacks on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> for four days, the city had been relatively quiet until about half a dozen rockets hit the hillside dump. Clouds of black smoke billowed over the northwestern part of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, flames danced in the night sky and explosions boomed across the city, several rocking buildings. At one point, all the lights in the city went out for 20 minutes in a power outage. But this morning the <PERSON> Khair </PERSON> <PERSON> Khana </PERSON> district was bustling again, including the streets just below the hillside dump, which looked like a burned field. In some houses the windows were broken and the floors were covered with ash, but otherwise the area looked untouched by the explosions. The government blames Moslem guerrillas for rockets that have slammed into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> almost daily since late June. More than 115 rockets have hit the city since Saturday. More than 40 hit the capital Monday, the worst day of the recent blitz. Eight people were reported killed. The U.S.-backed guerrillas fighting to oust the Soviet-allied government have tried repeatedly with little success to hit military targets in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Most of the rockets since late June have struck civilian areas. At least 281 people have been killed and 745 injured in the attacks, and a car bombing July 15 killed 19 and wounded 56, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources. A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Afghan army recently moved a large amount of ammunition from the city's airport to the depot. In a report quoting the official Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> news agency, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said government forces seized 300 artillery shells and hundreds of mines in Monday's operations. The report gave no other details. The government announced Tuesday that three men had been captured in connection with the car bombing. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the men belonged to `` counterrevolutionary organizations'' based in the Pakistani city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>. He said they had admitted masterminding the explosion. The most powerful guerrilla forces are based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said police were searching for other conspirators identified by the three men.

<HEAD>Savannah River Workers Drank Contaminated Water</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 100 <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> Site employees drank water contaminated with a carcinogenic solvent for 15 months, but an official from the nuclear weapons plant says they were not harmed. The incident occurred after a drinking water supply line was mistakenly connected to a system carrying tainted process water, said <PERSON> Becky </PERSON> <PERSON> Apter </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the plant for the government. None of the workers have shown symptoms of illness associated with trichloroethylene, or <ORGANIZATION> TCE </ORGANIZATION>, a potent degreaser and solvent that was found in the water, she said. `` The health effects are nonexistent,'' Ms. <PERSON> Apter </PERSON> said. `` What our doctors told us was the level of exposure they consumed was so low that there would be minimal health effects.'' Reactors at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the nation's sole source of tritium for nuclear weapons, have been closed for more than a year because of maintenance and safety problems. The mistake occurred in March 1988, when a water line was being installed to a new building. Du Pont, which built the facility and operated it for about 30 years, was plant operator at the time and the work was performed by a subcontractor Ms. <PERSON> Apter </PERSON> would not identify. A <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> engineer who was responsible for the job certified it had been done correctly, Ms. <PERSON> Apter </PERSON> said. But state officials said the engineer was working from an erroneous blueprint. Ms. <PERSON> Apter </PERSON> declined to identify the engineer, who she said was still employed at the facility. Medical records for all the employees were checked after the contamination was discovered, and physicians found no related health problems, she said. The contaminated water was found in only one building, officials said after testing water in all buildings in the administration area. `` Although federal drinking water standards were exceeded, the levels monitored in the service water are well below what would be considered dangerous,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> physician. `` However, we will continue to assess any possible health effects as part of the annual medical examination program.'' Samples from the building with the contaminated water showed levels of <ORGANIZATION> TCE </ORGANIZATION> averaged 26 parts per billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> considers 5 parts per billion a safe level. TCE has caused cancer in laboratory animals and is suspected of doing so in humans. The chemical also has been shown to cause damage to the liver and other organs, as well as sterility, developmental problems in children and damage to the nervous system, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. The mixup in the water systems was discovered last month when repairs were made to the system, Ms. <PERSON> Apter </PERSON> said. When workers were unable to turn off the water they realized the two systems were connected.

 The Martin Luther King Jr.. Center for <ORGANIZATION> Non-Violent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Change </ORGANIZATION> has refused to confirm or deny reports that the civil rights leader's 28-year-old son is resigning as center president A source within the civil rights community, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that differences over how the center should be managed prompted <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and executive director <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams-Skinner </PERSON> to decide to resign. The source did not say what those differences were. <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> was named president in January and officially took office April 4, the anniversary of his father's assassination, saying he wanted to place the center on a solid financial base and cut its dependency on donations. Messages seeking comment from King at his entertainment company, <ORGANIZATION> Visionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and his home were not returned, nor were calls to at least six King Center board members. The board said it would issue `` a definitive statement at an appropriate time.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Constitution </ORGANIZATION> reported that Ms. <PERSON> Williams-Skinner </PERSON> was said to have clashed with <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s aunt, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Farris </PERSON>, who controls the center's finances, over budgetary and program proposals. The newspaper also quoted Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> as characterizing the reported resignation as a family dispute fueled by normal tension between generations. <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, is the center's chief executive officer. Young, a lieutenant of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> during the 1960s, was among board members of the center who received copies of a letter of <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s resignation, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, another former King lieutenant, said the center recently had placed itself in competition with the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> founded, for leadership of the civil rights movement. `` The center's purpose was to perpetuate the legacy of Dr. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, but not to carry on the whole movement,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` When they started talking about leading the movement, freeing black folk, they started competing, and both got hurt.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said center staff members told him of conflict and asked for his help in resolving it, `` but I told them I was n't in a position to get involved, because people would interpret that as I was anti-Mrs. King.''

 Two abortion-rights activists running in the first state election since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on abortion emerged the apparent winners in the eight-way race for an Assembly seat and will meet in a runoff Oct. 3. Tuesday's results occurred in a district known for its conservatism even by <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> standards. `` I believe the abortion issue was the deciding factor in this election,'' said <PERSON> Jeannine </PERSON> <PERSON> Correia </PERSON>, who was the top vote-getter among the two Democrats in the race. The big winner appeared to be <PERSON> Tricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, the only abortion-rights candidate among six Republicans, who made a late surge to edge past candidate <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> had 14,658 votes to 14,446 votes for <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON>. Some 500 absentee ballots will be counted later this week, said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiler </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's office. <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON> said he was optimistic the absentee votes would reverse the outcome. Voters in the sprawling district, which covers arid sections of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> counties, were picking a successor to GOP Assemblyman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who died of cancer June 1. Voters were free to pick from among six Republicans and two Democrats, who appeared on the same ballot. None of the candidates won 50 percent of the vote, forcing a runoff between the top vote-getter from each party. The district is largely Republican _ 54.2 percent to 32.7 percent Democrat _ making the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidate an overwhelming favorite. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>, 36 of <LOCATION> Bonita </LOCATION>, is a nurse and president of the state Board of Registered Nursing. Activists on both sides of the abortion issue regarded the election as a significant indicator of public opinion. It was the first election for a state office since the July 3 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in <ORGANIZATION> Webster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> vs. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which gave states more authority to limit abortions. `` If it had n't been for the $ 100,000 the nurses association put into <PERSON> Tricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s campaign, the abortion issue never would have gained prominence in this race because she never would have been seen as a viable candidate,'' said <PERSON> Lyles </PERSON>, a 42-year-old management consultant from <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION>. `` It certainly gained more attention than it would have if the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision had n't come down, but our research showed most of the voters were concerned about other issues like water and education.'' <PERSON> Correia </PERSON>, an instructor for the developmentally disabled who lives in <LOCATION> Poway </LOCATION>, received 3,186 votes while the other Democrat on the ballot, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>, got 1,256 votes. <PERSON> Thorne </PERSON> also is pro-choice. The district has about 240,000 registered voters.

 Investigators today searched for five missing people and the cause of a blaze that killed at least three people at a rooming house whose landlord had been charged with failing to install an adequate sprinkler system. `` It's going to be a long and tedious job,'' said Deputy Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>. `` The building's not very stable and we're going to be taking it apart brick by brick. Authorities said building violations contributed to the still uncertain number of deaths and several injuries suffered among dozens of tenants who lowered themselves to safety on ropes after the fire broke out early Tuesday. Trooper <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> of the state fire marshal's office began inspecting the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crest </LOCATION> Plaza today and said he hoped to learn where the blaze began and whether the alarm system was working. `` We're just getting our feet wet,'' he said. The city previously had filed a criminal complaint against the building's owner for failing to install a proper sprinkler-alarm system. An attorney for the landlord said the sprinkler installation was to have begun next week. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Amero </PERSON>, 50, jumped to his death while trying to escape the fire shortly after it broke out about 12:30 a.m. Two other unidentified victims were recovered from the building's rubble. State Fire Marshal <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> said an adequate sprinkler-alarm system would have doused the hallways and alerted the fire department. Instead, he said, the system was substandard and residents, who claimed the building's fire alarm did n't sound, were left scrambling to safety. `` It went up like this,'' said tenant <PERSON> Dwayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 25, striking a match and shaking his head while watching it burn. `` Just like that, the whole building.'' <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonnell </PERSON>, 46, whose life was saved when <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> awoke him, made it to safety by clambering to an adjacent roof. Others were n't so lucky. `` I saw one guy start out the window, and then the smoke blocked the view,'' <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> said. `` And then when the smoke cleared, he was gone. I do n't know if he fell or went back in.'' Survivors said the screams of their neighbors pierced the night. `` It was n't screams of help,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, 19. `` It was more like screams of burning.'' The fire marshal and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> police disagreed on the number of guests on the night of the blaze, but early reports put the number at 37. By late in the day, officials said, five people were still unaccounted for. Extensive structural damage raised safety concerns and hampered Tuesday's investigation, said <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>. Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Decareau </PERSON>, head of <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>'s arson squad, said it was too soon to determine the fire's cause. <PERSON> Conway </PERSON> said city law allows climbing ropes in lieu of external fire escapes. But tenants and rescue workers claimed many of the ropes did n't reach the ground, so they were either left dangling or forced to jump to an adjacent building. `` We saw a couple of people that could n't reach the roof, and they got torched,'' said <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who tried to wake other tenants before escaping to an adjacent roof. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> DiVirgilio </PERSON>, mayor of this city of 80,000 on the seacoast five miles north of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said two criminal complaints were pending against the rooming house's owner. One involved the owner's failure to install a sprinkler system required under a 2-year-old city ordinance adopted after a 1984 rooming house fire that killed 15 people, the mayor said. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Allard </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Crest </PERSON>'s owner, has been battling the ordinance in court and refused to comment Tuesday. <PERSON> Allard </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, said his client and other rooming house owners were seeking reasonable time to install sprinkler systems

 The president of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, today was declared prime minister after an unprecedented parliamentary clash over who should have the job. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, became <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third prime minister in 10 weeks after sex and money scandals and a major loss in upper house elections forced his two predecessors to step down. `` There are many difficulties awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and I will try to work hard and express my frank feelings to the people,'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said after his selection by the lower house, where his party has a comfortable majority. The less powerful upper house supported <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>. It was the first time in 41 years that the two houses had clashed over who should head the government. Under the constitution, if the houses can not agree on a prime minister, the lower house decision prevails. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> was elected president of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which lost public support after the disclosure last year that the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate tried to buy political favors from leading politicians. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> has said he received about $ 110,000 in legal political donations over five years from the Recruit Co.. Two people he named today to top posts in the governing party also have Recruit links <PERSON> Ichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON>, the new party secretary-general, and <PERSON> Shunjiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Karasawa </PERSON>, the new chairman of the decision-making Executive Council, have acknowledged receiving legal donations from the company. <PERSON> Hajime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamura </PERSON>, speaker of the lower house, declared <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> prime minister in a brief announcement. Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> said she was not discouraged. `` Today, the door was only half opened, but I am determined to continue to work to fully open this door some day,'' she said. `` Aug. 9 surely reflects the beginning of the end of the long rule by the <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>.'' The general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>'s upper house victory `` proved we will be seeing a very unstable political situation'' in coming months. `` For the first time in 41 years the wheels of history have shifted,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` Formally, the lower house choice prevails, but politically the upper house vote has proven that this administration is only half an administration, and <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is only half a prime minister.'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> said the delay caused by the disagreement between the houses was a `` severe consequence of our election defeat,'' a reference to July 23 elections for half the seats in the upper house. In that vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost their majority in the upper house for the first time in their 34-year history. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is succeeding <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who resigned after the July vote. He lasted only 69 days in office, losing support because of reports he kept a paid mistress. Earlier today, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s Cabinet resigned en masse, clearing the way for <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> to form a new government. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who resigned because of the Recruit scandal, which tainted most of the top figures in the governing party. The tarnished reputations of top <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> figures made it possible for <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> to vault into the party leadership, even though he has little personal clout as a member of a minor party faction and has not served in top party or government offices. But <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> brings a more youthful image to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s highest office and has credentials as a reformer. He was a member of the party's reform committee and an aide to the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Miki </PERSON> when <PERSON> Miki </PERSON> was trying to clean up Japanese politics in the 1970s In addition to <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karasawa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> today appointed <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON> to be head of his party's <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, the outgoing foreign minister, has said he did not have any connections to the Recruit Co.. Japanese newspapers gave mixed early notices to <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s The liberal-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes `` he will not stumble badly,'' and it called on <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> `` to work for genuine changes in his own party.'' The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>'s editorial applauded the debate that accompanied the election for party leader. `` After the Cabinet is formed, -LRB- <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s -RRB- first task should be to carry out political reform to regain public trust. The very fact that <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is not a faction leader demonstrates the acceptance of the need for reform,'' <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The former top aide to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy and agreed to testify against the evangelist. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney said the deal was suspect because the aide had sold his soul. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> on Tuesday also refused to delay <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s trial, turning down complaints from defense attorneys' about pretrial publicity. `` Whether this case is tried in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Ottumwa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, two years from now, there is going to be pretrial publicity. It is one of the prices that we all must pay for a free press,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. Jury selection is scheduled to begin Aug. 21 with opening arguments a week later. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>, former executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud, one of wire fraud by telephone, one of wire fraud by television and one of conspiracy, according to one of his attorneys, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON>. `` Beyond that, we have no comment,'' <PERSON> Calloway </PERSON> said. A plea agreement calls for <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> to cooperate with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in `` whatever form'' requested, including `` sworn testimony in court and documentary materials.'' `` <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> will become the key witness against <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON>, who represents convicted former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> aides <PERSON> David </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>. `` Having pleaded to conspiracy _ with <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> being the alleged co-conspirator _ it will be very difficult for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to convince the jury that at least on the charge of conspiracy he's innocent,'' <PERSON> Cotten </PERSON> said He also said the Taggarts would consider testifying against <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney, said he was not surprised by the plea agreement and said <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>'s testimony has `` got to have some effect.'' `` These kind of deals are somewhat suspect from the very nature of the animal because it is not uncommon for people to sell their souls if necessary to save their bodies,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. Under the agreement, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> could face a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. Prosecutors agreed to ask the presiding judge at sentencing to dismiss the remaining 20 charges against <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>. The agreement also specifies that <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> could be asked to make restitution. <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> had tried unsuccessfully to have his trial separated from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. The two men were charged in a 24-count indictment with diverting more than $ 4 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to their own benefit. A federal grand jury indicted them on eight counts each of mail fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could face 120 years in prison and more than $ 5 million in fines on the charges. The case stemmed from a 16-month investigation into the televangelism empire under <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s leadership. The grand jury heard from more than 100 witnesses, reviewed thousands of documents and watched tapes of old `` <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'' shows. Tuesday's agreement came on the heels of the July 25 tax evasion convictions of the Taggarts. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s personal aide, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, his former interior designer, are scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 25 by Judge <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>. They each face 25 years in prison and more than $ 1 million in fines.

 The Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said today that efforts to free Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> suffered `` their greatest setback'' as a result of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A statement released by the party's information center said the July 28 kidnapping of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and two relatives was a `` terrorist crime of piracy.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to trade <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and all Shiite prisoners it holds for three Israeli servicemen and the 16 Western hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The Zionist enemy has suffered a bitter dismay because of his failure to achieve his objectives from the crime of abducting <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemy after this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release the Israeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked,'' it said. `` Moreover, the refusal of the enemy to release <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and his two relatives, and his linkage of the problem of the Zionist POWs with that of the hostages might hurt the West and further complicate the hostage issue,'' the statement added. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s main ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, is believed to be the umbrella group for extremist factions holding most of the hostages. `` We contend that past efforts for the release of the Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is passing through the greatest setback because of the foolhardiness committed by the racist Zionists, who appear perfectly willing to sacrfice all others for their selfish interests,'' the statement said. It repeated its urging that the West pressure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. Israeli officials have said <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> admitted under interrogation that he took part in planning terrorist attacks, including the abduction of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> Feb. 17, 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is lying about the reported confessions.

<TEXT>
 Anti-government rebels armed with axes, machetes and clubs massacred 54 civilians near the southern coastal town of <LOCATION> Xai-Xai </LOCATION>, the official news agency AIM said today. The report said most of the victims were kidnapped by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> and marched to <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> village, just outside <LOCATION> Xai-Xai </LOCATION> and 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, the capital. The civilians were hacked or beaten to death on Monday, AIM said, quoting a report in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>'s Noticias daily newspaper. The report said the fatalities included 13 women and eight children and that 17 people were injured. The attack occurred while rebel leaders and government representatives were meeting in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> in a bid to settle this country's 12-year-old civil war. Mozambican churchmen, acting on behalf of their government, met with rebel representatives Tuesday, but no major breakthroughs were reported. No explanation was provided of why the civilians were killed. However, the rebels, who have been accused of many civilian atrocities, sometimes take civilians prisoner to carry their equipment and then kill them afterward. No government acknowledges supporting the guerrillas. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> openly supported them until 1984, and some reports say it continues to do so. However, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> says it is now abiding by a non-aggression pact with neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> says he accepts <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s word. However, officials in <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> still believe the rebels receive help from non-governmental groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The war has killed 600,000 people, created more than a million refugees, and left nearly half the country's 14.7 million people dependent on food aid.

 The aircraft carrier <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was reported today to have resumed patrol off the coast of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, putting another powerful military force at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s disposal in the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> hostage crisis The nine-ship battle group was in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, nearly 4,000 miles away, when the crisis arose July 31 with the reported hanging of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> by his <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> captors and a death threat against a second American hostage. The <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> cut short its port visit by four days to return to its assigned duty station in the north <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, a voyage requiring nearly a week. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials refused, as a matter of policy, to discuss ship movements, but <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the carrier was headed for the `` north end of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>.'' A convoy located in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, or further south in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, could steam north through the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION> and enter the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said on Tuesday that the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was `` conducting routine operations'' in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> but would not say where. Other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was resuming normal duties in the north <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The battle group was deployed in June to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION>, the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surface fleet operating within striking distance of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The force also includes 10 ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The 79,000-ton <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s port call at <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> had been scheduled well in advance, and a military source called it `` just the breaks'' that the hostage crisis arose during its absence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf region have operated at reduced alert status and spent more time in port since <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> agreed last year to a cease-fire in their eight-year war. Administration sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have been quoted as saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had opted for a military reprisal if any more hostages were killed. They said he would probably use planes from the carrier USS Coral Sea in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> to strike suspected terrorist strongholds in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. However, the sources have not ruled out an attack on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is considered to wield great influence over Shiite Moslem groups holding Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In that event, the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and its more than 80 combat aircraft would be the probable choice. Military analysts agreed that the most logical target for military action against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be its big oil terminal at <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 500 miles northwest of the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, the gulf outlet to the Arabian Sea. For the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes, it would mean dodging the terminal's anti-aircraft defenses that downed a number of Iraqi planes during the war The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the gulf are designed mainly for missile war against aircraft, ships and submarines. Their 5-inch and 76-mm guns would be hard put to inflict more than token damage on a sprawling complex like <LOCATION> Kharg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. Military sources ruled out any use of the <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, noting that its planes would have to make a 3,000-mile round trip through the airspace of several countries.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> says he wants to establish an international unit in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> devoted mostly to curbing drug trafficking. `` Often more than 50 percent of my day is devoted to some matter relating to our international involvement in fighting drug trafficking, money laundering, international organized crime and business fraud, environmental depredations, terrorism or espionage,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a speech Tuesday at the American Bar Association convention. Outlining President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 1 billion crime-fighting package, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said he would seek congressional approval for an <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has endorsed the idea. A spokesman for the attorney general's office said existing money could be redirected to fund the unit. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s proposal to have an office that reports directly to him to coordinate <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> international law enforcement efforts comes at a time in which the federal battle against drugs is under great scrutiny. The president's drug policy coordinator, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, is preparing a congressionally mandated battle plan. As part of the effort <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys around the nation recently issued a report that placed heavy blame on international drug trafficking for the 30 percent increase in violent crime in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the past decade. Although violent crime is mainly the responsibility of state and local authorities, `` the federal law enforcement can not look the other way while violence, often drug-related, ravages many of our inner-city communities and subjects innocent citizens to the cross-fire of turf wars between urban terrorist gangs,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s crime package focused on increasing the penalties for the criminal use of guns, ending plea bargaining in such cases, hiring more investigators and prosecutors and doubling the space in federal prisons, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. `` Such a comprehensive approach, if replicated at the state and local level, can go a long way toward restoring much-needed credibility to the deterrent capacity of our criminal justice system,'' he said. Regarding drug use and trafficking in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the only way to win the `` war on drugs'' was to `` re-establish the values that make a drug-dependent lifestyle an inadmissible option in this great nation.'' He praised the military's mandatory drug testing program, saying it reduced the incidence of drug use from 27 percent in 1980 to 4.8 percent last year. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> urged more drug testing of American workers. Speaking to reporters after the speech, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s validation of drug-testing meant private and public-sector employers could begin `` reasonable'' drug-testing progams. `` I think private employers should examine the appropriateness of it in the workplace,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, a flamboyant lobbyist who has been a headline figure in the federal investigation of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> call-boy ring, is facing cocaine and gun possession charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, it was reported today. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, 48, was arrested July 31 along with a male prostitute at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. The Times said that in an eight-hour interview Monday, <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> disclosed that he discovered `` about three years ago'' that he had contracted AIDS and was threatening to commit suicide rather than die of the disease. `` I had the world at my house,'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said of parties where he played host to some prominent Washingtonians, `` and now they do n't know who I am. The Times said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> revealed that his apartment had been rigged with listening devices by `` friendly'' intelligence agents he refused to name. He said he had destroyed audio tapes and photographs by the time the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> raided his apartment in July, and all that was left was his anti-AIDS medication, AZT. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that when she arrived at <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s room in the Barbizon Hotel she heard crashing. `` This guy <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> comes running out of the room screaming that the other guy has a gun,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` We got the gun and it was n't loaded. We determined that it belonged to <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. There were drugs in the room also, cocaine and a crack pipe.'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> _ a dashing figure who represented Japanese clients at the height of his lobbying activities _ was released on his own recognizance several days later. He is scheduled for a court appearance Aug. 28, the newspapers said. Police said the 22-year-old male prostitute with <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> was charged with drug possession. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, a former television correspondent, was identified this summer by the Times as a major client of a homosexual escort service. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office are investigating that service for possible credit card fraud, authorities said. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> he never spent as much as $ 20,000 a month for call boy services, as reflected by credit card receipts obtained by the Times. He claimed charges were improperly inflated by an escort service manager. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> also has been linked to a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> guard who has said he accepted an expensive watch from <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> and gave him a piece of presidential china. The guard, <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> deGueldre </PERSON>, also reportedly allowed <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> and some friends to take midnight tours of White House public areas last year. The Secret Service has said the tours were unauthorized, but not a security breach. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> said that at his work level, `` <PERSON> Reggie </PERSON> could n't have arranged anything,'' and acknowledged the exchange of gifts.

 International judges are working quietly to resolve disputes between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> over billions of dollars of frozen assets, despite bitter differences between the two nations. The members of the <ORGANIZATION> Iran-U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, have remained isolated from day-to-day politics. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rejected a suggestion that American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> could be released if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> agreed to release frozen Iranian assets. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted a source saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would intercede to gain the release of the American hostages if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gave assurances it would release frozen Iranian assets. Eight American hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The questions of the assets have no connection ... whatsoever with the hostage issue,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. `` This is a legal process. It's a very technical process. And it's the business of the tribunal to work through the claims and the cases before them and to work them out.'' <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused to consider tying the hostages' fate to issues before the tribunal but is continuing its `` intensive diplomatic efforts'' to free the captives. However, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified senior administration official as saying there may be more room for maneuvering. `` And while we would not give a direct quid pro quo, we would offer some understanding or agreement that ` if you use your good offices to get the hostages,' we will look favorably on your desire to get the assets,'' this official was quoted as saying. The tribunal, established in 1981 after <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> freed American hostages held at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for 444 days, has done its work in a non-political environment. Since it was established, the tribunal _ composed of nine international judges _ has resolved billions of dollars worth of claims. Three judges are American, three are Iranian and three are from other countries. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nationals have been awarded about $ 1.2 billion, while Iranians have received about $ 118 million. The claims, made by banks, companies, individuals and governments, stem from the 1979 breakdown in diplomatic relations between the two nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze billions of dollars of Iranian assets, including hundreds of millions of dollars worth of military equipment bought by <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON> before his regime was toppled. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also seized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets. When the tribunal was established, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> transferred about $ 9.9 billion in frozen assets to escrow accounts and to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has little control over that money, the disposition of which is regulated by tribunal rulings. But the Iranians have filed separate claims, amounting to roughly $ 12 billion, for military equipment bought under the shah. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it does n't know how much the shah had already paid, but he had committed to buying $ 20 billion worth of hardware. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has generally followed the tribunal's decisions, making payments to claimants when ordered to do so, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said. Some American companies, however, have appealed the tribunal's decisions in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts, effectively delaying payments, they said.

 A Shiite Moslem clergyman on a suicide mission today detonated a bomb-laden truck near an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military convoy and wounded five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s army and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leader said the attacker was a `` comrade'' of <PERSON> Sheid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Shiite Moslem clergyman held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofaili </PERSON>, did not say if the attack was in retaliation for the abduction. The pickup truck blew up in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a joint Israeli-South <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> convoy was passing by. Israeli's army said five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and one of the allied Lebanese militiamen were wounded. One soldier suffered serious injuries and the others suffered light or moderate injuries. Two people in the truck were killed, the army said. <PERSON> Tofaili </PERSON> said there was only one attacker and identified him as <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Asaad </PERSON> <PERSON> Birro </PERSON>, a Shiite clergyman. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> also released a statement saying, `` The Mujahid -LRB- holy warrior -RRB- detonated the car he was driving as an enemy military convoy drove past.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the blast left a crater six feet deep, overturned an army vehicle and damaged nearby houses. The radio said the pickup was carrying 550 pounds of explosives. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, said the `` martyrdom operation'' was carried out at the entrance to the Christian village of <LOCATION> Qleiaa </LOCATION>, about two miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border, at 9:45 a.m. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, believed to be the umbrella for factions holding most of the 16 Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said in the statement that the attack was carried out to `` declare our loyalty to the course of Imam <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and his successor <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'' of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and allied militiamen put up roadblocks and were searching for suspects. It said a number of Lebanese residents had been detained. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> released a second statement today saying that efforts to free Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> suffered `` their greatest setback'' as a result of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> on July 28 from his home in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemy after this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release the Israeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked,'' the statement said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> says <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, an ally of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, was involved in the abduction of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> near this southern port on Feb. 17, 1988. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' kidnappers, the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said July 31 that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was hanged in retaliation for <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction Some reports have said he was killed months earlier, and his body has yet to be recovered. The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, another underground pro-Iranian faction, offered Sunday to release <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and 450 Arab prisoners and allowed 55 Palestinian deportees to return to the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, a 6-to-10-mile-wide strip, after withdrawing most of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985. Israeli army officials said the casualties could have been higher if the convoy had not been keeping large distances between each vehicle in the convoy of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> forces. The injured were taken to hospitals in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> by helicopter. Dr. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sattinger </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Rambam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>, said two soldiers suffered skull injuries and were undergoing operations. A third suffered an eye injury from shrapnel. The last suicide car bomb attack was Oct. 19, 1988, when eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers were killed and seven wounded 300 yards from the border. Shiite Moslem radicals in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> also claimed responsibility for that explosion. In March 1985, a car bomb attacker drove into a convoy of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> vehicles, killing 12 Israelis and wounding 14. The attack was claimed by the pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syrian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Prior to today's attack, the army said there were 43 car bomb attacks and attempts along the border since October 1982.

 Police discovered a playground stand where children operated a make-believe drug ring offering bags of grass clippings and sugar. `` We just lost the war on drugs,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Bernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. `` I do n't care what -LRB- President -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says, this is bad.'' Police discovered the stand last week and said children had recorded pretend drug transactions on a ledger and on scraps of colored notepaper. One note read `` Cocaine, small half-baggie, 55 cents, small baggies, $ 1,'' The Patriot newspaper of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> reported today. `` What you have to understand is I have no doubt -LRB- they -RRB- are copying their parents. They want to make a lot of money and not work,'' said Detective <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. Detective <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Capello </PERSON> said one of the worst days of his 11 years of police work came when a city resident handed him a fishing-tackle box containing the fake drugs, the ledger and a crudely written IOU The resident said the box came from a 7-year-old boy and a 9-year-old girl at the playground. `` It's a shame the kids ca n't use this kind of intelligence to better themselves,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLeo </PERSON>. `` These kids were intelligent to set something up like this.''

The chief said the victim and her husband were community and anti-drug activists who `` made a lot of enemies on the block.'' `` She tried to clean up the drug dealers,'' said a neighbor who would not give her name. A note slipped under the family's door said in Spanish, `` If you do n't back off, you'll be killed,'' <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said.

 A Romanian woman who was nine months pregnant fled her native country by floating across the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> in an inner tube and then hiked six miles before giving birth in a hospital, a <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> weekly reported. <PERSON> Camelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Popescu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorina </PERSON>, a 30-year-old teacher from <PERSON> Turn </PERSON> <PERSON> Severin </PERSON>, a town near the border, made the escape alone, <ORGANIZATION> Ilustrovana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> said in its edition published Tuesday. Her husband escaped separately to <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the report said. Mrs. <PERSON> Sorina </PERSON> reportedly took a taxi to a town near the border, telling the driver she was visiting relatives. At about 2:00 a.m. she inflated the inner tube, secured her documents and some food on her arm, and started across the river, the magazine said. According to the report, she reached the Yugoslav side of the river after about an hour and waited until morning before continuing her journey. After hiking six miles, Mrs. <PERSON> Sorina </PERSON> reached the town of <LOCATION> Kladovo </LOCATION> and boarded a bus for <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>. The woman went into labor during the ride and gave birth to a girl in a hospital in the town of <LOCATION> Negotin </LOCATION>, 65 miles south of <LOCATION> Kladovo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ilustrovana </PERSON> <PERSON> Politika </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is saying `` the right words'' but must `` turn on the music and dance'' by pushing policies that will help black Americans reach economic equality, civil rights leader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said today. `` We have already seen a friendlier <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a gentler White House, but now we must activate the kind of budget, the kind of job training opportunities, the kind of rectifying of the past few years of neglect ... to move from righteous ceremony to righteous sacrament,'' the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> addressed the league's annual conference on Tuesday, saying that his administration `` will not tolerate discrimination, bigotry or bias of any kind _ period.'' `` We have heard Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> say the right words; now he must turn on the music and dance with me ...,'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> said. `` Dance to the harmonious melodies of full employment, adequate wages, dance to the rhythm of affordable and available health care for all of the citizens of this country.'' <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> also called for action from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which he said `` has yet to demonstrate the advantage of the Democratic majority that we helped bring into being, particularly in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` What difference does it make whether it's a Democratic majority or Republican majority if they ca n't override a veto to keep the minimum wage'' at its present level, <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recently vetoed legislation to raise the minimum, and the veto was sustained in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Urban League President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said following <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address Tuesday, `` I am willing to concede that the first six to eight months is the rhetoric period'' in judging a new administration `` We will use the next 12 months to determine how well he does in carrying that out. His rhetoric is right. He is saying the right things. Now we have to find out whether he is willing to do the right things,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the first president to address an <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> conference since President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1979, received generous applause Tuesday. But <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokley </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I would have felt a lot more comfortable if the president had addressed the recent rulings of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, especially those that deal with affirmative action.'' Recent decisions of the court have held that state and local governments generally may not impose racial quotas for public works hiring, that minorities must meet higher statistical standards to prove they are being relegated to less desirable jobs, and that white workers not involved in an 8-year-old affirmative action ruling were nevertheless entitled to attack it in court. `` No matter what he says his moral and philosophical conviction is ... at this point I have n't heard him say anything about the laws in this country that were designed to protect blacks, women and other minorities,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tokley </PERSON> said. `` And until he does, I will not be convinced that he actually means what he says.'' <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> judge attending the conference, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s address `` was a very neutral talk as far as minorities were concerned.'' `` I do n't know that I expect him to be on our side,'' <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> said. `` I'd be happy if he is n't against us. And at least I did n't get the sense that he's against us, and that's a plus.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the delegates the gulf between white and black <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has narrowed, but has not been closed. `` Closing that gulf _ eliminating it for all time _ is the next chapter we must write in the unfolding history, the unfinished history, of civil rights,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He conceded that he and civil rights leaders have disagreed about how to accomplish that. `` We've argued _ society's argued _ about affirmative action, about quotas, goals and timetables, about set-asides,'' he said. But the most important point, the president said, is that `` bigotry and bias may take more subtle forms -LRB- than in the past -RRB- but they persist _ and as long as they do, our work is not over.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> organizer of underground tests of an experimental AIDS drug says he will accept a government invitation to discuss bringing the trials into the open. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>, co-director of the AIDS education group <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inform </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that he found the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s offer to discuss sanctioning the trials a positive development. `` We have said from the beginning we would like to do this in the open,'' <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said. The clandestine trial began in April when the drug began to be viewed by AIDS patients as a last hope. <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said he and others started the unauthorized testing to find out whether it worked before its uncontrolled use became widespread. Going through the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> would have taken too long, he said, but he also has said that he and others kept the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> apprised of the study. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> began investigating the underground trials of Compound Q in June after a patient died and two others had adverse reactions. <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said it was unclear whether Compound Q was related to the death. Compound Q is a protein from the root of a cucumber-like plant that has been used for centuries in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to induce abortions and treat certain tumors. <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON>'s group smuggled the drug into the country with the help of couriers. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> told <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> in a letter he received Tuesday to stop the trials, but offered to talk about conforming them to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations. `` While we can not condone the unapproved administration of trichosanthin -LRB- Compound Q -RRB-, we share your belief that important drug evaluation information may be generated by community-based organizations,'' said the letter, signed by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evaluation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` We therefore want to meet with you, and with other concerned parties, just as soon as possible, to discuss the possibility of your participation in a community-based trial ... that complies with existing law and regulations,'' the letter said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> has come to rely increasingly on community-based trials, a concept pioneered by AIDS activists in which local physicians administer experimental therapies to AIDS patients and keep detailed records as part of a safety and efficacy study. The underground study of 42 patients is nearly completed. Treatments with the drug have finished and analysis of the data is expected to be completed within the month, <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said. `` We will have enough data to make a reliable judgment to know whether this is a big deal'' and worth further testing, he said. `` After that everybody at <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> is going to have to scratch their heads and ask why it takes 3 -LCB- years under normal -LRB- FDA-approved -RRB- circumstances'' to make the same determination. If the drug is worth testing further, <PERSON> Delaney </PERSON> said he and others would bring the data to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and talk to <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials about opening FDA-sanctioned, community-based clinical trials. The only approved clinical trial of the drug for AIDS patients is being conducted at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. A highly purified form of trichosanthin developed at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Genelabs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> is being used in that trial. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> says its procedure for approving drugs, including several levels of clinical trials, is designed to determine reliably the safety and effectiveness of a drug as well as to protect those who volunteer to participate.

 An obituary on a living person does not harm the individual's reputation and thus is not libelous, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Death is a natural state and demeans no one,'' the court said Tuesday in a 6-0 decision affirming lower court rulings against a family that sued the <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> Packet for printing the obituary in 1985 of a woman who had not died.

 Rescuers extended their search today across the border into <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> in the hopes of finding <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 13 others who disappeared two days ago while flying to a refugee camp in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. Ethiopian authorities reported today that a plane had been heard flying Monday near <LOCATION> Mizan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teferi </LOCATION>, 50 miles south of the Fugnido refugee camp, where <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and his entourage were headed. The twin-engine plane carrying <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, 44, and the others vanished during bad weather near <LOCATION> Ethiopian-Sudanese </LOCATION> border, 480 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a Democratic from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, was in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> on a return visit because of his keen interest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s refugee problem.

Up to 10 small planes were being used in the search today, directed by <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> medical evacuation plane left <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this morning en route to <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> in case it was needed. The weather today was markedly better than Tuesday, when heavy clouds and poor visibility hampered planes coursing the cold plateau in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, political officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. Rescuers continue to focus on a region called <LOCATION> Dembidola </LOCATION>, about 75 miles north of <LOCATION> Fugnido </LOCATION> where Ethiopian authorities said a small plane reportedly was heard circling Monday, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> officials. The Dembidola region borders <PERSON> Mizan </PERSON> <PERSON> Teferi </PERSON>. Earlier, embassy officials said they were told the plane actually had been sighted near <LOCATION> Dembidola </LOCATION>, but today acknowledged they had been misinformed. Dembidola is in an accessible region of foothills between mountains that rise up to 12,000 feet and swampy plateaus stretching to the Sudanese border.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Aug. 2 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Light </LOCATION> on terrorism: No matter what option President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> selects to respond to the new terroristic activities in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, that option must not involve negotiation with the terrorists, under any circumstances. ... <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began weighing his options after the reported hanging of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force, by his Lebanese kidnappers, even as the terrorists threatened other murders. Our president made an urgent call for all parties holding hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to release them immediately, `` to begin to reverse the cycle of violence in that region.'' ... In <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy crisis over the new terroristic activities, he confronts the same problems his two presidential predecessors encountered in relation to <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> atrocities: An enemy in large part unseen, splintered into many religious factions with many different names, embracing a culture in which these splinter groups play by rules with which we are not familiar. ... It would be easy to invoke a knee-jerk reaction of an eye for an eye in relation to the activities of terrorists, but that kind of retaliation is not effective against such a mysterious enemy. A diffused target is difficult to hit. Because each situation of <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> terrorism is unique, it is difficult for this nation to establish one national policy to cover all. The no-negotiation policy, however, must be retained.

It could happen again. ... Unless President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his advisers handle the situation adroitly, they could find themselves doing nothing more than reacting to an agenda set by a group of terrorists in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. ... What the president must do, instead, is make clear American outrage over the murder of Lt.

 Aug. 8 <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on the hostage swap negotiations: What initially had been proferred as a more or less straightforward swap of a radical Lebanese Shiite cleric abducted by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> ... for three of its captured servicemen is ... showing signs of evolving into a multidimensional international bargaining session of great complexity and perhaps long duration. As <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, formerly one of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> experts so aptly put it over the weekend, `` the bazaar is open,'' and the offers, counteroffers, threats and ultimatums are starting to be heard from all sides. ... It could be encouraging if it means that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> are finally ready to use their influence _ which means apply pressure _ on <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, the radical Shiite group that holds the Western hostages. At the same time, the direct involvment of outside forces, each with its own priorities, promises to complicate any confidential negotiations aimed at pulling off a prisoner swap. ... Complicating things still further are the family ties that account for at least some of the hostage-taking in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Many of the 17 Shiites jailed in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for attacks on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French embassies, for example, are related to a single Lebanese hostage-taking clan, whose one demand from the beginning has been for their release. ... If indeed, behind-the-scenes efforts are under way to construct a grand exchange, a lot of countries and a lot of parties will have to be involved. It's going to be a hard and probably lengthy business, and given the disparate interests involved, the outcome can by no means be taken for granted.

The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, for example, is nearing approval of a bill to greatly increase the oil industry's liability for spills and to establish a $ 1 billion cleanup fund and disaster response teams along the nation's coast.

The study criticizes the single-bottom structure of the Exxon Valdez. Double bottoms, the study maintains, `` are effective in reducing the potential oil outflow from grounding.'' Tanker transportation may indeed require different safety precautions depending on the nature of the cargo and the sea to be sailed. Not debatable is the need for enforceable precautions. They should be a matter of law. The oil industry, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must work to agree on safety measures to protect the nation's waterways.

 Aug. 7 <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION> -LRB- Miss. -RRB- Evening Post on capital gains taxes: They laughed when <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigned last year in favor of lowering capital gains taxes. Democrats claimed it was just a way to feather the nests of the wealthy, and since they control both houses of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, that was supposedly it. But lo and behold, a majority of the key <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> lined up the other day in favor of a bill to reduce the tax people owe on the gains they make on the sale of stocks and other assets. Such capital gains are now taxed the same as ordinary income, at rates of 15 percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on total income. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed a top capital gains rate of 15 percent. He may not get that. Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., has introduced a bill that would have a maximum 20 percent rate for two years, and then a 28 percent rate A bare majority of the committee, 13 Republicans and six Democrats, support the <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> measure. Both proposals would lower taxes for about 7.9 million couples or individuals. Democratic leaders are accusing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of trying to dismantle the 1986 Tax Reform Law. This measure changed the favorable treatment of capital gains to make them conform with ordinary income. But the administration offers compelling arguments that giving taxpayers a break on such gains will boost the economy. It would encourage savings and reduce costs of investment for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION> business. It also would afford a hefty boost in revenues next year as investors moved to realize capital gains on assets that otherwise would remain untaxed. This would help ease the still-troubling deficit problems. ... Such factors, plus the definite boost to the economy, offer persuasive evidence on the need for more favorable treatment of capital gains.

 Aug. 6 Las Cruces -LRB- N.M. -RRB- Sun-News on savings by Americans: Americans do n't save enough, and that poses a serious and long-range problem. This fall the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration plans to begin a campaign to urge all of us to salt away more of our earnings. In 1987 the personal savings rate sank to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent. Last year saw only slight improvement. We predict an upturn in the savings rate regardless of the degree of success of the administration's urging. The Baby Boom generation is now moving into middle age. Middle age is the peak period for saving. Earnings are at a peak at the same time the need for saving grows increasingly apparent. Taking the long view, savings must be encouraged. If they are not, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will almost surely see its standing among the leading industrial nations further eroded. Savings means investment, investment means new businesses, and new businesses mean new jobs. But it's going to take some doing. It wo n't be easy to change Americans from big spenders to frugal penny-pinchers who have relearned the adage: `` A penny saved is a penny earned.''

 A Jewish settler mistook soldiers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for Palestinians about to attack and fired on the troops, provoking return fire that killed his infant son, the army and hospital officials said today. Also today, a 6-year-old Palestinian was reported killed when troops opened fire during disturbances at a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp, hospital officials said. Businesses in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> were closed today as Palestinians held a general strike to mark the end of the 20th month of their uprising against Israeli rule. The infant, <PERSON> Itai </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON>, 19 months, was shot in the head and died at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. The army said the soldiers opened fire when the father, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON>, 30, stopped his car Tuesday night and shot into a grove of trees at an army patrol. The father was shot in the chest and slightly wounded, and a second son, <PERSON> Ordan </PERSON>, 4, was slightly wounded, the army said. <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>, 6, was fatally shot in the chest by soldiers firing from a rooftop during clashes in the Shati refugee camp, according to an official at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The army said it was checking the report. Since the uprising began in December 1987, 531 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with soldiers or other Israelis. Thirty-eight Israelis have been slain. Also today, three Palestinian youths were shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers, two in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> and the third near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. A military spokesman said the army was checking the reports. Graffiti was sprayed across walls in the occupied lands calling for the intefadeh, or uprising, to continue. `` Children of the intefadeh _ their faces are furious, their games are stones,'' said one slogan signed by the uprising's PLO-backed Unified Leadership in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> The incident involving the Jewish settler occurred while <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON> was traveling to his home in the settlement of Ariel, an army announcement said. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON> noticed a light in a grove of trees and mistook the soldiers for Palestinians lighting a firebomb to throw at his car. <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON> backed up and fired into the trees, the radio said. It noted that news reports earlier Tuesday had reported a firebombing nearby. About 70,000 Jewish settlers live among 1.7 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The settlers have complained bitterly that the army has failed to protect them from stone and firebomb attacks during the uprising, and many carry arms. Also today, soldiers tore down two houses in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps that belonged to men who admitted killing four Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israeli authorities, the army said. The army identified the men as <PERSON> Tewfik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Naim </PERSON> of the Nusseirat refugee camp and <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Makdama </PERSON> of the Bureij camp.

 Non-Estonian factory and transit workers went on strike today in the Estonian capital to protest a new law adopted with nationalist support to tighten residency requirements for elections. `` The strike is against yesterday's decision, which the workers consider discriminatory,'' said <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>, an ethnic <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> and leader of Inter-movement. The group is championing the interests of Russians and other non-Estonians in this small Baltic republic. The law passed Tuesday by the republic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, requires residents to live in their district for two years or anywhere in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for five years before they are allowed to vote. Candidates for elective office must live in the same place for five years or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. The official Soviet news agency, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, said workers in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> were not unloading freight trains or airplanes and that some auto transport workers also were on strike. Air freight was paralyzed, it said. <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>, speaking in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, said the Elamo construction enterprise, the Dvigatel motor works, and the <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> electronics plant were on strike. He said workers had struck at least 17 sites, but he could not give a figure for how many people had walked off their jobs. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said workers at 19 sites were on strike. Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the population and pushed the law to protect themselves from an influx of other nationalities. But Russians, who make up about a third of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s 1.6 million people, charge that the law discriminates against non-Estonians because they tend to be more recent arrivals. `` The law guarantees general voting rights to practically all citizens of Estonian nationality and deprives tens of thousands of people of other nationalities,'' the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted a deputy identified as <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukoshkin </PERSON> telling the Estonian Supreme Soviet on Tuesday. Non-Estonian workers conducted a warning strike in late July but ended it when the government agreed to form a commission to look into their complaints. Now, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, the strikers want the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to set up a commission to look broadly into <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s drive for greater local control. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has adopted a series of measures to increase its local autonomy and protect ethnic Estonians. The republic has won approval from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to launch a new economic policy that Estonian leaders say will even allow the republic to issue its own currency.

 A bomb hidden in a plastic lunch box exploded today on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi-bound </LOCATION> bus, killing at least 12 people and injuring 35, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> and reporters at the scene said at least 15 people were killed. <ORGANIZATION> UNI </ORGANIZATION> said the explosion blew off the bus' roof and both sides. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the bombing, which occurred in <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> state near <LOCATION> Karnal </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION> police spokesman, Inspector <PERSON> Inder </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON>, said the dead included two children. Sixteen of the injured were in serious condition, he said. The bomb exploded about 1 p.m. while the bus was passing the <LOCATION> Karna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> tourist resort outside <LOCATION> Karnal </LOCATION>, 75 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> said. Karnal is midway between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, capital of both <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> states. The bus, operated by state-run <ORGANIZATION> Haryana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roadways </ORGANIZATION>, started its journey at the resort hill town of <LOCATION> Kasauli </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Himachal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state and stopped at <LOCATION> Ambala </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Punjab-Haryana </LOCATION> border. It was not immediately known how many people were on the bus, which normally carries at least 60 passengers. In June 1988, Sikh extremists planted a bomb that killed 18 people at a market in the <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Kurukshetra </LOCATION>. Sikh militants have waged a deadly campaign since 1982 for a separate state in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and periodically launch attacks in neighboring states and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. At least 1,116 people have been killed by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> radicals in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> so far this year, according to police reports. Sikh gunmen killed six people Tuesday night in <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, summer capital of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state. <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state, like <PERSON> Himachal </PERSON> <PERSON> Pradesh </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION>, borders <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 A father and daughter accused of trying to kill a younger, 360-pound daughter to put an end to the woman's medical bills bought a freezer to hold the body one day before the shooting, police say <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON>, 78, and his daughter <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> are charged with assault with intent to murder, accused of twice shooting 32-year-old <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> in the head Sunday. The woman was listed in serious condition today. The two suspects have told people `` they were going to put <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> in the freezer,'' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. An unidentified appliance salesman told today's <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that the two suspects bought a freezer Saturday. `` They came in here bopping around, and it was funny how fast they bought it,'' the salesman said. `` I asked him if he was a hunter. But he said he needed it because he wanted to store some extra meat.'' The Kwiatkowskis gave police a receipt for a 16-cubic-foot freezer chest to be delivered this week, authorities said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the purchase casts doubt on the father and daughter's reported claim to hospital staff that they planned suicide after shooting the woman. Authorities said the two, who were jailed on $ 50,000 bail, took Ms. <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON> two hours after the shooting. She was able to walk into the emergency room, staff said. Police said Ms. <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> was shot with a .32 - caliber handgun because of high medical bills run up by her asthma and her <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Torikian </PERSON>, a retired sheriff's detective who lives across the street in the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> suburb, said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwiatkowski </PERSON> feuded with neighbors and said the woman sometimes chased her father up the street while yelling obscenities. `` No, I guess it is n't a surprise,'' another neighbor, <PERSON> Evelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>, said of the shooting. `` The father and older sister wanted to keep her under their control.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to settle a suit _ the legal variety _ by tailoring its policy on alterations. The department store chain said Tuesday it will offer free alterations on skirts and dresses, as it does already on suits, blazers and slacks. The action settles a sex-discrimination suit filed by feminist attorney <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> on behalf of two women charged $ 40 each for alterations on dresses. The suit demanded <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> charge equally for altering men's and women's clothes. `` We are now adding several free alterations on dresses and skirts, and we will continue to review the policy for similar appropriate revisions,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to pay the plaintiffs nearly $ 25,000 in legal fees, <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> said. At the same time, the store chain insisted its previous policy was fair. <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> `` has never had a double standard so it ca n't agree to end one,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Acton </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, which has 45 stores nationwide. <PERSON> Acton </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> had charged for altering dresses and skirts because they involve more work than men's clothing. There was no charge for minor alterations to clothing considered `` unisex,'' such as blazers and slacks. <PERSON> Allred </PERSON> lauded <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> as `` sensitive to issues that affect women'' and said the stores' response to the suit `` could serve as a model for the industry.'' `` Women can not afford to pay more for alterations than men must pay,'' she said. `` Charging them more solely on account of their sex is economically damaging both to their bank accounts and to their dignity.''

 Rescue workers reached a snow-covered mountain today where a sightseeing plane crashed and reported that the four Americans, five Canadians and one New Zealander aboard all died. Nine bodies were recovered today and the workers were searching in deep snow for the 10th, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzharris </PERSON>, chief police inspector at <LOCATION> Dunedin </LOCATION>.

A New Zealander was piloting the twin-engine <PERSON> Britten </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Islander </PERSON> that went down Tuesday near Mount Aspiring, between <LOCATION> Milford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> and the town of <LOCATION> Wanaka </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, one of two main islands that make up <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Two alpine rescue dogs were used to help a team of 27 police and rescue personnel recover the bodies, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. It said the wreckage was scattered about 4,000 feet up a mountainside and that dogs were brought to help find bodies buried in snow. Police site controller <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dedlury </PERSON> said the crash had triggered a small avalanche that slid about 1,000 feet down the slope with the wrecked aircraft. To minimize vibrations that could cause an avalanche, rescuers used small Squirrel helicopters to carry the bodies away from the scene. Some bodies were found inside the fuselage, but others were scattered around the slope, <PERSON> Fitzharris </PERSON> said. The nine bodies were transferred to a mortuary in the southern city of <LOCATION> Invercargill </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here is the text of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>'s statement Wednesday on the Western hostages. It was translated from Arabic by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. In The Almighty's Name The Zionist enemy has suffered bitter dismay because of his failure to achieve his obectives from the crime of abducting <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and his relatives from the struggling town of Jibchit, the terrorist crime of piracy. It is clear that things have backfired on the enemy after his foolish crime. It has become impossible to release the Israeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked. Moreover, the refusal of the enemy to release <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and his two relatives, and his linkage to the problem of the Zionisventures over the last 58 years in the delightful <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> books. `` Babar: The Movie'' brings the exploits of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, their children and their friends to the screen. It is a tale within a tale: <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> tells his four children the story about how he, <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Zephir </ORGANIZATION> the monkey outwitted <PERSON> Rataxes </PERSON> who was trying to conquer the elephants. `` The rhinos do n't respect others. They just trust violence and force,'' said <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON>, who continues the series of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> books created by his father in 1931. `` <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> respects the other one, and always tries to find a clever way to solve a problem _ without using force. `` The film has a lot of action. In the book, it's a totally different way of looking or listening to the story. You can take your time and dream. In the film you're passive, so the action has to go on the screen more intensely.'' Dozens of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> books are in print, including `` The Travels of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>,'' `` <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> and the Professor'' and the one that started it all, `` The Story of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>,'' in which the young elephant is crowned king. <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>'s admirers even include many adults such as children's author <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Sendak </PERSON>, who once wrote, `` If he had come my way, how I would have welcomed that little elephant and smothered him with affection. `` I think every kid likes elephants,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> said in an interview. `` They may not like them in the same way as teddy bears or rabbits, but elephants are funny because of their trunks. To have this elephant living like a man is very, very funny. It's possible for the kid to assimilate himself to the elephant. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> does not avoid the darker side of life. <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> is an orphan -LRB- his mother was killed by a hunter in the first book -RRB- and, in the film, the rhinos capture the adult elephants, leaving their children behind, weeping. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> insisted that showing pain was essential. `` Children like to be in the middle of a drama,'' he said. `` It's not traumatic, they just react with emotion. As long as the good win and evil is the loser, I think it's fine. `` It's bad when it becomes sadistic. Otherwise, I think it's wrong that only sweetness is good for the kids. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON>, who grew up in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, was introduced to <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> the same way as most children: through a bedtime story. In 1931, when he was 6 years old, his mother told him about a little elephant. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> and his younger brother, <PERSON> Mathieu </PERSON>, were so taken in, they repeated the story to their father, a painter at the time. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> quickly filled in details, naming the elephant <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> and creating <PERSON> Celeste </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Zephir </ORGANIZATION> and the `` Old Lady'' who takes care of young <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> after his mother is killed. `` He did a book for us with pictures,'' <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> recalled. `` He enjoyed the story a lot and everybody in the family liked it, too. I happened to have two uncles in publishing, so the book was published and was a success. My father made a second and third book, and so on.'' But in 1937, <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> died of tuberculosis. At the urging of his uncles, 13-year-old <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> completed two books unfinished by his father and eventually devoted himself fulltime to <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>. `` After World War II, I was working as a painter,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunhoff </PERSON> said. `` The idea of making a book occurred to me because I loved <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>; he was my friend. The idea was appealing and I tried to get close to the style of my father.'' <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> eventually added some of his own touches, notably using his niece as the basis for one of <PERSON> Babar </PERSON>'s daughters. A resident of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> since 1985, de Brunhoff is at work on brand new <PERSON> Babar </PERSON> stories for an upcoming HBO series on cable-television. `` There are times when you have nothing to write about, but something always comes. You're traveling, in the countryside, fishing or meeting somebody you're interested in. Maybe someone tells a joke,'' he said. `` I have my studio in the house and a wall where I put some sketches when I'm working. I also have one or two posters in my study, but I do n't like to be overwhelmed.''

 In another confrontation between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian forces, <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> disarmed a group of Panamanian soldiers and civilians who followed the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> into an area the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> controls. The group of 29 Panamanians, including 10 military officers and lower-ranking soldiers, was briefly detained and then released after Tuesday's incident, said <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. She said the soldiers included Maj. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieiro </PERSON>, brother-in-law of <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the head of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s de facto leader. <PERSON> Sieiro </PERSON> commands the Chorrera military zone, where the incident occurred. A local mayor said the Panamanians began following the Americans after the Marines encountered an anti-American demonstration. The pro-government news media had called the American maneuvers a provocation. Ms. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the incident occurred west of this capital city when about 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines in armored vehicles were carrying out a reconnaissance exercise on roads leading to the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. She said the Panamanians `` ventured without authorization into a military zone'' reserved exclusively for American forces. Ms. <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> said the Panamanians were disarmed and held for about an hour and 15 minutes. She said their weapons, including machine guns and rifles, will be returned to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces. Five Panamanian journalists were in the detained group, but they refused comment. There was no report of any <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> resistance. A series of such minor incidents have been occurring since February 1988, when two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to use economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Most of the Panamanian-American incidents have involved exchange of a few shots during the night or the arrest of Americans accused of traffic violations.

 Non-Estonian factory and transit workers walked off their jobs in the Estonian capital of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> on Wednesday to protest a new law that tightens residency requirements for voting and holding elected office. `` The strike is against yesterday's decision, which the workers consider discriminatory,'' said <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>, an ethnic Russian and leader of the InterMovement group that is pushing the interests of Russians and other non-Estonians in the Baltic republic. `` I'm concerned about my children and grandchildren,'' said <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Chugunov </PERSON>, 42, one of those on strike at the <PERSON> Kalinin </PERSON> electronics factory. `` They started with a language law, and then it's something else, and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'' said <PERSON> Chugunov </PERSON>, a 33-year-resident of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>, who wo n't be affected by the tighter residency requirements. The strikers sent a committee of four to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to seek a meeting with Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chugunov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chugunov </PERSON>, a member of the strike committee, said thousands of workers were on strike at 20 enterprises in <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> Kokhtla-Jarve </LOCATION>, an industrial city east of <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION>. He could not give the total number of strikers, but he said that at some of the largest factories, 3,000 or more workers were off the job. Pickets blocked the entrances to the factories. <PERSON> Kogan </PERSON>, a deputy to the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies parliament, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> that in addition the Elamo construction enterprise, the Dvigatel motor works and the fishing port also were affected. <PERSON> Paab </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaala </PERSON>, an editor for official Estonian Radio, said he could not estimate the number of strikers, but said the strike committee overstated the number of strikers by several times when it conducted a warning strike in late July. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said workers were not unloading freight trains, and air freight was paralyzed. Many <LOCATION> Tallinn </LOCATION> bus drivers also walked out, but officials brought in buses from other cities and kept public transportation running. No disturbances or demonstrations were reported on the streets. <PERSON> Kaala </PERSON> said there were no appeals from the government for the workers to return to their jobs, or any other official statements about the strike. Non-Estonians were protesting passage of a law by the republic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, on Tuesday, requiring residents to live in their district for two years or anywhere in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for five years before they be allowed to vote Candidates for elective office must live in the same place for five years, or in <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> for 10 years. Ethnic Estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the population, and pushed the law to protect themselves from an influx of other nationalities. But Russians, who make up about a third of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s 1.6 million people, charge that the law discriminates against non-Estonians who tend to be recent arrivals. `` The law guarantees general voting rights to practically all citizens of Estonian nationality, and deprives tens of thousands of people of other nationalities,'' the national daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> quoted deputy <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukoshkin </PERSON> telling the Estonian Supreme Soviet on Tuesday. The warning strike in late July ended when the government agreed to form a commission to look into their complaints. Now, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, the strikers are demanding that the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> set up a commission to look broadly into <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>'s drive for greater local control. <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> has become a laboratory for reforms, and the republic has won approval from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to launch a new economic policy that Estonian leaders say will even allow it to issue its own currency.

 Light rain and cooler weather today led fire bosses to lift the `` red flag'' lightning warnings that went up over the weekend in the Northwest. Firefighters reported progress against dozens of mostly lightning-caused blazes in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` The temperatures have been lowering, the humidity has been coming up,'' said <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkhead </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's wildfire command post. `` That's really given us a handle on a lot of the fires.'' The fire center replaced its long-running forecast for dry lightning with a prediction of showers, lower temperatures and higher humidity across the West. Still, 23,000 firefighters were battling blazes on 160,000 acres of timber and range. More than 220,000 acres have been charred in mostly lightning-caused fires since July 26. Western and central <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> were still the hardest hit, with 15 major forest fires burning out of control over 104,000 acres. About 9,200 firefighters in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, including hundreds of military troops, cut fire lines in the rain. `` This by no means puts fires out, and it can give people a false sense of security,'' <ORGANIZATION> Payette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sonny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LaSalle </ORGANIZATION> said. `` But what it will do is give us the opportunity to get a lot of line built, get some mop-up done and increase the security around some of these fires.'' About one-third of an inch of rain was reported Tuesday at <LOCATION> Lowman </LOCATION>, a small mountain community 70 miles north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> virtually leveled by fire 10 days earlier. Several dozen residents were allowed to return home. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> and <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>'s house was spared but everything around it burned. `` The quietness and the peacefulness will come back, but the scenery is gone,'' said <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>. `` It hurts to see this happen, but it's happened and you ca n't do a thing about it.'' Progress was reported 30 miles to the north, where 2,400 firefighters, including 600 soldiers from <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, battled the 18,400-acre Warm Lake fire complex. With higher humidity clearing the air of dense smoke, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blackhawk </ORGANIZATION> helicopters supplemented <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> airpower on fires still threatening the small town of <LOCATION> Warren </LOCATION>, about 120 miles north of <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>. Resource losses in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> are estimated at more than $ 75 million since a July 26 lightning storm scored the state's backcountry with 40,000 strikes, which sparked hundreds of wildfires. The 10,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> Emmett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION> and the 7,000-acre Summit fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Hells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>, on the border with <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, should be contained by Thursday, said <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. About 3,500 lightning strikes across <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> started several fires in the <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> district in the southwest corner of the state, but rain limited their size The biggest fire in eastern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, the 23,350-acre Canal fire, was declared contained Tuesday evening, <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> said. Calmer, cooler weather helped firefighters contain <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s largest wildfire, a 2,500-acre blaze on the Colville Indian Reservation Crews by Tuesday had contained two southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> fires, the 15,300-acre <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> fire in <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> and the 7,500-acre <PERSON> Balch </PERSON> fire in <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Officials at the <LOCATION> Chalk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> fire, about 45 miles east of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, released half the crews mopping up the 1,700-acre blaze.

<HEAD>Latest Drug Tools: Carrier Pigeons, Gas Tanks, Corn Fields</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Things are not always what they seem in the drug trade, where a gas tank may also contain cocaine and a corn field may hide marijuana plants. The barest outlines of those and other dealers' methods of hiding drugs were listed in individual reports on drug trafficking presented by the nation's 93 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> councilman said Wednesday that constituents told him drug dealers were even using carrier pigeons to transport money and messages. <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said the birds had been spotted flying in and out of a bar known to area residents as a hotbed for drugs. `` When people begin talking in the community, they're probably right,'' Councilman <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It's too far-fetched to be made up.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys who presented the report last week often deleted details so the strategies could not be copied. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, told of cocaine or money carried from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> in a modified gas tank. `` This modification consisted of the construction of a baffle within the tank whereby the left side of the tank was a separate compartment from the main tank,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s report said. `` This compartment was accessible only by removing a plate attached to the top of the gas tank and was not visible from under the car.'' The fuel gauge operated normally, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, but the vehicle had to make more stops than usual for gas. Even fields of corn may not be quite what they appear. Marijuana plants are intentionally surrounded by corn plants in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, where a growing number of groups specialize `` in the cultivation and harvesting of higher grade marijuana,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, authorities last year found 190 pounds of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> heroin concealed in a bean sprout washing machine shipped from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> reported the seizure of more than 2,400 pounds of cocaine hidden inside a shipment of cartons labeled `` Anchovies in Salt Water.'' The cocaine was weighted and packaged `` so as to be virtually indistinguishable from the surrounding cans which actually contained anchovies,'' said a report by Philadelphia-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Baylson </PERSON>. Also popular with drug dealers is strapping drugs to carriers' bodies <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> gang members strap crack under their clothes or send it on Greyhound or <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parcel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for transport to <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s middle district. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, authorities found spare fuel tanks loaded with 250 pounds of heroin base on a trawler in 1984. The same Asian drug organization that used the fuel tanks also shipped heroin in ice buckets, wall plaques and in a shipment of T-shirts headed for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that was seized in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> in December 1986, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s eastern district. Tapes and records produced by <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> groups are sometimes used to transport contraband to North American record stores, said western <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. Drug dealers' `` increasingly clever ways to deliver drugs and collect money'' are forcing the authorities to change their approach, <PERSON> Baylson </PERSON> said this week in an interview. `` It's becoming increasingly difficult to find large caches of drugs because dealers are adept at spreading it around,'' he said.

 Though many people have a strong aversion to maggots, the parents of a 17-year-old girl say the centuries-old practice of allowing the fly larvae to eat decaying human tissue may have saved their daughter's legs. `` My husband said, ` Let's go for it,' and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> said ` Let's go for it,' so we did and it worked,'' <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON>, the patient's mother, said Tuesday <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON> became critically ill suddenly on May 10 and was taken from a clinic to <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the next day. Doctors there diagnosed her illness as <LOCATION> meningococcemia </LOCATION>, a blood-borne bacterial infection that caused heart failure, kidney problems and diseased skin, and eventually led to the amputation of part of one leg and the toes on the other foot. Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fields </PERSON> of the hospital staff said antibiotics used to kill the bacteria released a powerful toxin in <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON>'s circulatory system that caused blood clots, reducing the flow of blood to her legs Meanwhile, the bacteria continued its direct attack on her skin, rotting it from the inside out, said her father, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Poolesville </LOCATION> town commissioner. Once <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s doctors amputated her left leg below the knee and her toes on the right foot, they still were faced with cleaning the remaining skin so skin grafts could be done. Antibiotics did not work fast enough and paring the skin from her legs did not work well enough, her doctors said. `` With <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s tissue dying, they needed to do something,'' said <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON>. `` When they use surgery, they take the live tissue as well as the dead tissue, and they had taken so much that they wanted to avoid that at all cost. All of her skin from the waist down was dying.'' After a long search by the hospital and the Dillinghams, more than 1,500 fly larvae were located in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. On July 21, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> watched as the insects, so tiny she could barely seem them, were released onto her legs and secured with tape. `` At first, they tickled when they put them in. My nurse and I were laughing,'' she said. `` I could feel them moving everywhere.'' After 36 hours, doctors used a high-pressure hose to wash them away. By then, the maggots had grown from less than one-sixteenth inch in diameter to nearly as big around as the end of a little finger, her father said. `` It's a gruesome issue, but we know that it can work,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Provost </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dermatology </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's clinically well-known that maggots will eat the dead tissue while leaving healthy tissue intact.'' Maggots have been used for centuries to remove dead tissue from infected wounds, said Dr. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, assistant professor of internal medicine and history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>. `` When you have an infected wound, you'd rather have an animal, like a maggot, eat it up rather than letting -LRB- the infectious tissue -RRB- stay there,'' <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> said. `` It was probably used more before antibiotics, or when it was more difficult for people to get to surgery.'' Although the treatment has been used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since at least the Civil War, <PERSON> Provost </PERSON> said it has been used in modern times only as a last resort because of people's aversion to the maggots. `` It is really horrendous,'' Provost said, `` and most physicians are reluctant to do it because it tends to be sensationalized.'' But <PERSON> Dillingham </PERSON>, a former teacher of biology, physiology and anatomy, was familiar with the cleaning capabilities of the insects and encouraged his daughter to try it. `` I just wanted to get out of the hospital,'' said <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, who is senior class president and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Poolsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Junior-Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> track team. `` If the maggots meant I could get out sooner, then I wanted them to use them.'' <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>'s doctors are optimistic she will walk again with protheses. `` The grafts have taken a hundred percent,'' her mother said. `` We're on the home stretch now.''

<HEAD>Panel's First Task to Tackle Health Care Financing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of a Social Security advisory panel that starts work this week said Wednesday the council's first mission is to tackle the financing of a health care system that faces new strains with the aging of the Baby Boom generation. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION>, said the current health care system `` overlaps, duplicates, omits, confuses'' and leaves many needy people without adequate care. `` It is critical that we develop recommendations for a sound, sustainable health care financing system, one that delivers the benefits people need, at a price we can all afford,'' she said at a breakfast meeting with reporters. The 13-member advisory council holds its opening meeting on Thursday and Friday. Such a panel is appointed every four years to examine issues affecting the Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid programs. Ms. <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said the council hopes to issue a draft report on health care financing by July 1990 and recommendations on the financing and role of Social Security benefits by December 1990. A final report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> is due in January 1991. Ms. <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said the current <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> system `` is projected to be insolvent by early in the next century, before the Baby Boom has even begun to enter retirement.'' The smaller ranks of people in the generations following the Baby Boom will make it difficult for them to finance benefits for the bulge in retirees that precedes them, she said. Meanwhile, the current patchwork health care system and various proposals for reform leave patients `` in a wilderness of health care finance, trying to figure out what they're covered for, what they're not,'' she said. `` I think there's a growing consensus that we have followed the meandering path of health care financing just about as long as we can afford to,'' Ms. <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said. `` I personally believe you can not fix this system without starting over.'' Ms. <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON> said she is hopeful the panel will come up with new ideas on how to restructure the health care system, saying the council `` can be very radical'' as it searches for solutions. `` We can be the spurs in the side of the horse,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Steelman </PERSON>, a lawyer, was a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign adviser and is a former associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>.

 Alto saxophonist <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, playing and hearing his compositions at a concert on his 82nd birthday, told the audience he's `` looking forward to a whole lot more.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s alto saxophone style was elegant and tasteful at Tuesday night's concert in <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Tully </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>. It was the fourth concert of six in this year's Classical Jazz at Lincoln Center series. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s compositions, and arrangements for the <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> and Count Basie bands, were important in the development of big band swing. However, Tuesday's concert was uneven. Pianist <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, bassist <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and drummer <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Durham </PERSON> started tentatively, with `` Key Largo.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> joined them for `` Blues in My Heart.'' <PERSON> Ernestine </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who could n't get rid of a frog in her throat, sang a tune that sounded country-western and another that called for a bossa nova beat. The drums were too loud and the bass too soft. Every time the music began to capture a listener's attention, the master of ceremonies brought the audience back down with long, irrelevant remarks about the musicians. After intermission, <PERSON> Dizzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> joined the four, and some starch entered the evening. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> introduced `` <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gillespie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>,'' which he said they recorded in 1976. It included a pretty melody for their duet. `` Easy Money,'' which followed, swung. And it was about time. <PERSON> Sylvia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> sang three <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> songs, nicely swinging the first one, `` Blue Moonlight.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> played his lyrical `` Evening Star.'' The best part of the evening had <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> singing `` When Lights Are Low,'' `` Cow Cow Boogie'' and `` Doozy'' and <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON> and Company singing the arrangement <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> wrote for Basie of his sparkling `` Meetin' Time.'' The finale had everybody singing `` All That Jazz'' and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, saying he was overwhelmed, blowing out candles on a cake. Icing melted by the burning candles splashed onto <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s suit. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> whipped out his big handkerchief and played mopup.

 Two leading social scientists who tried in May to persuade Chinese legislators to oust Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> were expelled Wednesday from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and fired from their research posts. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON>, who fled to the West, and <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Zunxin </PERSON>, who is believed to have been arrested, are the first party members to be expelled in the crackdown on dissent that has followed the June 3-4 army attack on student pro-democracy protesters. Many other academics have been arrested or lost their jobs. But even party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who was ousted from his party posts, has been allowed for now to retain his party membership. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> `` were expelled because both had stubbornly clung to bourgeois liberalism over a long period of time.'' Bourgeois liberalism is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official phrase for Western-style liberalism. They also were fired from their research fellowships at the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. `` They joined in fanning and organizing the recent student unrest, turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. It accused <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, who recently helped organize a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students' group in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, of continuing to plot against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership from A warrant has been issued for <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>'s arrest. <PERSON> Xinhua </PERSON> did not comment on <PERSON> Bao </PERSON>'s whereabouts. Both are among 10 authors whose works can no longer be published or sold. Since January, they were prominent participants in an emergent democratic movement among intellectuals that was crushed when the army crushed the seven-week student protests. Both signed petitions for the release of political prisoners, and after the students began marching, both spoke out in support. They signed a May 17 declaration that said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was still ruled by an emperor, a reference to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, and published an article in a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper calling on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s legislature to oust <PERSON> Li </PERSON> In othere developments Wednesday: _ Foreign-language newspapers went back on sale at <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> hotels after being banned nearly a month ago. _ Chinese newspapers continued to harshly criticize <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, the ousted party chief, and said Western concepts of human rights were irrelevant in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. However, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruihuan </PERSON>, the party official in charge of press and cultural control said the party still wanted `` exploration in art and literature.'' Hotel managers in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said they did not know why the state-run <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> resumed delivering foreign newspapers this week. `` They came as silently as they left,'' said <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON>, manager of the Great Wall Sheraton. He said company officials told him `` things have been settled, but we never got a straight answer'' about what the problem was. The publications company halted its deliveries in mid-July and seized copies of newspapers and magazines already on hotel racks. Hotels in other tourist cities were not affected. Most of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s major hotels said newspaper delivery resumed on Monday or Tuesday, but they did not receive any magazines or Hong Kong-based Chinese-language newspapers. `` Maybe the magazines will come tomorrow, and maybe next week we'll get the television,'' <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> said. The government ordered hotels to cut their reception of foreign television, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, last month. Hotels are among the few places Chinese have access to foreign publications that provide alternatives to the official line on the protests and crackdown. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading newspaper, meanwhile, heaped more criticism on <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. In a front-page article, the People's Daily accused <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of using the pretext of `` adapting'' the party to new ideas to weaken its ideological stance. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily ran a commentary arguing that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s human rights policy is irrelevant because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> rejects Western definitions of human rights. `` They make human rights out to be independent of society,'' it said. `` Therefore, it is a sacrifice any time the authority of the society, race or country demands necessary limits on the authority of the individual. They cry out that this is an invasion of human rights.'' The commentary said that under Marxism, `` no human rights exist outside of or independent of society.''

<HEAD>Unions Accept Extra Pay Deal, Tell Drivers To Call Off Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Union leaders Wednesday accepted a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway management pay offer and told workers to abandon a 15th weekly strike planned for Thursday. <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodds </PERSON>, assistant general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railwaymen </ORGANIZATION>, and leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locomotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> and Firemen said they were pleased with the pay offer, although it represented about one-third of what <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground drivers had been seeking for operating trains alone under a planned phase-out of rear guards. Under the mediated offer, the Underground's 2,600 drivers will receive an extra $ 27.10 weekly, without having to boost productivity as management initially had demanded. Drivers had asked for an extra $ 104 a week. Guards will also receive a separate $ 9.70 a week raise in the deal. Union leaders said they were confident workers would be on their jobs Thursday. Most of the pay raise would be paid beginning Aug. 1, and the rest on Jan. 1, when drivers will earn $ 539 a week. A board appointed by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> last week mediated the agreement between management and unions as the 15th strike loomed. The subway strikes have been one of the longest-running stoppages during a summer of labor unrest, which also hit passport offices, railways, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s double-decker buses and other industries.

<TEXT>
 Civil rights leaders said Wednesday it was kind of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to come talk at their conference, but one added that it's now time to `` dance with me, Prexy.'' `` We set the clock yesterday when he started talking and we will run it until we get here next year,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at a news conference winding up a four-day convention here. The Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, struck a similar note in a concluding address. `` We heard Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> say the right words. Now he must turn on the music and dance with me, Prexy,'' he told delegates. `` Yesterday's meeting with the president would have been a lot different if he had some dependency on African American voters,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` The truth of the matter is that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was being kind when he came here yesterday. We did n't elect him and he knew that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in his speech committed his administration to combatting discrimination, but some delegates expressed disappointment that he did not comment on recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that have eroded affirmative action. `` We must call the administration to sacrament,'' said <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>. `` We must call it to deal realistically with the terrible problems we face today.'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said he believes Republicans are making modest inroads among black voters, but added, `` If the Republicans are really serious about attracting <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION>, they need to get some programs that deal with the problems, concerns and aspirations of the African American community.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the first president to participate in a national Urban League conference in a non-election year since <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in 1977. `` This president has at least said that he is willing to debate the issues and work with us,'' the Urban League president said. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said he believed the conference made headway in dealing with the issue of drugs, which was high on its agenda. `` I think this conference has made a major contribution through raising the consciousness level,'' he said, `` but also putting this organization on record as being at least one national organization that is African American that has publicly stated that it intends to wage war on drugs.'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said it was up to the government to stop drugs at the border and provide drug treatment programs, but, `` We can, in our own neighborhoods, help put the pushers in jail.''

<HEAD>Refugee Wants to be Deported, But Red Tape Stalls His Return</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A Nicaraguan refugee being held at an immigration detention facility is fighting to be deported to his homeland. Four months after a judge ruled that <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> should be sent back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, he remains at the <LOCATION> Krome </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> detention center. He's even willing to buy his own ticket back to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, the Nicaraguan capital. `` I ca n't stand it. I'm desperate to see my family,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 31. `` I want to go, but they do n't want to send me.'' Of the dozen or so Nicaraguans at <LOCATION> Krome </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> is the only one who wants to go back, he said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' case is bogged down in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where it is under review by the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Since 1987, it has been standard for Nicaraguans' deportation orders to be checked by <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officers to give asylum-seekers an extra level of review before they're forced out of the country, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON>, assistant director of deportation for the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> district of INS. `` I would have to admit it's bureaucracy,'' <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' situation. `` We've added additional steps to protect the rights of Nicaraguans going to back to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. This process is very cumbersome.'' But added Powers, `` It's ridiculous to have the system prevent a guy from going back.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> arrived March 15 at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> with a valid visa but without documentation as a cruise ship employee. He initially asked for asylum at the airport but dropped that by the time he had a hearing April 11. The INS ruled him excludable, and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> did n't appeal. At that point, <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said, even though it had been noted in <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' file that he wanted to be deported, his records were shipped to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> along with those of people fighting deportation.

 Nearly two weeks after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> defected to the Republicans, a facsimile machine belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was used to publicize a speech he was to make. `` I see a little humor in that,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said Wednesday. A news release sent by fax to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, identified in the release as a Republican, would speak Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. It said reporters could contact <PERSON> Kip </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> for more information and gave a telephone number. The number was for the headquarters of the state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> is executive director. He is also in charge of Rotary Club publicity. <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> confirmed Wednesday that he sent the release. `` It really is a real deal. It did come from us. I'm a member of that club and on the board and one of my responsibilities is advising the press. We asked Congressman <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> about three months ago to come and speak to us,'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> switched from Democrat to Republican on July 28, saying he was no longer comfortable as a conservative southerner in his old party. <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said he saw no problem with using a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fax machine to get news coverage for a Republican, and said he uses the machine to relay weekly releases about the <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>'s guest speakers to newsrooms in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. `` It was not like it was long distance,'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said, adding that there was no cost to the party for the local call. `` Certainly I appreciate the free publicity,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, `` but I do n't know if that will put him in good standing with the Democrats. I think it's a very kind gesture on their part to let people know about my speech by way of their fax machine.'' `` I like <PERSON> Kip </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> and I do n't have anything against <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. One day they will make the same decision I have made,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> was joshed by <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Coon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. `` We make mistakes ourselves sometimes. I guess <PERSON> Kip </PERSON> secretly wants to change,'' <PERSON> Coon </PERSON> said with a laugh Wednesday. `` I appreciate the publicity. We need all the help we can get.'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said he joked about <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> during last week's Rotary meeting. `` Tongue in cheek, I stood up and asked Mr. President whether it would be the honorable thing for the congressman to address us since we scheduled him when he was with one party and switched to another,'' he said. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was introduced to a meeting of civic clubs at <LOCATION> Benton </LOCATION> as: `` A Democrat, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> ...'' The man giving the introduction said the information came directly from a biography supplied by <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s office. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> replied with a grin: `` I will check with my staff when I get back to the office this afternoon about the bio they sent out.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today pledged to pursue every diplomatic channel to win the release of the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but vowed not to get involved in `` trading off or negotiating for hostages.'' `` I hope I am open-minded enough to talk and to exercise every diplomatic channel I can to free these Americans,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a brief question-and-answer session in the Oval Office. `` And no American is going to be content until these Americans are free.'' Promising to pursue every avenue to win the release of the hostages, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the lives of all of them are `` too precious for me to be sticking my head in the sand.'' The president said some parties who have been ambivalent or silent on the hostage issue are now willing to help because they are `` so infuriated or angered or repulsed'' by a videotape purporting to show an American hostage hanging from a rope, as well as by a death threat against another American. `` There is a common thread: this is too much, enough is enough,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about his policy on dealing with hostage takers in the wake of a comment in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> in which he said, `` We do not negotiate in any way that's going to jeopardize the lives of other Americans.'' The administration's policy has been that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will talk with anyone but will not negotiate for the release of the hostages. `` I do n't think there's any subtle change'' from the position he took in 1986 when he led a task force that wrote a report on terrorism, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I'm not going to do anything that would put some other American, perhaps in some other place at some other time, at risk,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And that means trading off or negotiating for hostages.'' Discussing his policy on dealing with kidnappers, particularly on whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might release billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would `` do nothing that will be seen a quid pro quo for hostages.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> answered questions while posing in the Oval Office with Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called on Americans to say a prayer this weekend for the hostages and their families, as well as for world peace. The president said he wanted to be alert to any possible opening to win the hostages' release. `` I do n't want to miss a signal,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been described by his spokesman as cautiously optimistic, but said in the Globe interview he had no reason to believe the hostage problem would be solved in the immediate future. He told reporters today, `` I've never felt that the hostages would be here tomorrow but I hope they will. I hope that something will happen.'' Earlier, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, while saying there was no new policy, acknowledged that the administration had come up with new language `` to give definition'' to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stand. In another development, the wife of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said she is praying for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s efforts to `` save the living'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, acknowledging that her husband almost certainly is dead. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, wearing her <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> uniform and speaking in a calm and steady voice, acknowledged for the first time Tuesday it is a `` virtual certainty'' her husband is dead. `` Now is not the time for anger and bitterness, for recrimination and blame. `` Now is the time for calm reflection. ... Now is the time to tell <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> that we love him and we miss him,'' she said. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was the commander of a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> when he was abducted on Feb. 17, 1988. His Shiite Moslem kidnappers released a 30-second videotape a week ago that purported to show him dangling by a rope, bound and gagged. The terrorists said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officer was hanged in retaliation for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s kidnapping of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a Moslem cleric. Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a Marine major, is on leave from her job as a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> public affairs officer. In her statement, she made no mention of the grisly videotape released by her husband's kidnappers. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> says it has concluded `` within a reasonable degree of medical certainty'' that the person depicted in the videotape was <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but it released no information about the time or cause of death. The bureau's analysis suggests <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was killed in some other manner before the videotape was made, according to an administration official who declined to be named publicly. Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, her hands shaking slightly as she read from her prepared text, said she had been `` advised ... of the virtual certainty that my husband ... is dead'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> commandant, Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. She also noted she had received calls from the president. `` I am also mindful of the fact that our president has agonized in a very profound and personal manner over my husband's fate,'' she said. `` He has my prayers and my support as he tries to save the living and end the suffering.'' In her statement, Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> lauded her husband as a man of tolerance and dignity who served as a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeper because of `` a profound sense of duty.'' `` Rich went to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the service of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> because he believed he could be useful, that he could help, that he was needed,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. `` He wrote in his high school yearbook that his goal was ` always to make my family proud of me,''' Mrs. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> said. `` He succeeded.''

 A woman was sentenced to six months in jail today for abandoning her newborn daughter in a jetliner bathroom. <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> pleaded no contest May 25 to felony child endangerment in a plea bargain promising her no more than a year in jail.

Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> turned herself in the next day.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military government has set up more regional military courts and extended martial law powers to junior army commanders, according to an official Burmese report. The report, issued Tuesday, came on the first anniversary of the beginning of a natiowide uprising for democracy, which Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> crushed in September after he took power. A July 18 order empowered the commanders of the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> region and northwestern and central areas to establish military courts to try martial law violators. These were already put into effect in the capital, <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. The new courts, which can impose sentences ranging from three years in prison to death, have now been set up in the northwestern and central military administrative districts, the official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday, quoting new orders dated Aug. 2. A transcript of the report was available Wednesday in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. The new orders also extended the authority to dispense martial law to junior commanders in both areas. On Aug. 8, 1988, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to protest a quarter century of harsh socialist rule. The following day, troops shot and killed hundreds of unarmed protesters. Although <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has promised to hold multiparty elections next year, martial law forbids open political dissent. However, Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> reported a number of small protests by students who braved martial law to commemorate last year's protests. One diplomat reached by telephone from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> on Wednesday quoted a witness who reported seeing a student clubbed on the head with a rifle butt Tuesday. Troops at the time were reportedly dispersing about 70 demonstrators and 200 bystanders in the center of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Five people were arrested, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The diplomat said there were also reports from the northern city of <LOCATION> Mandalay </LOCATION> that several thousand monks had mounted a protest Tuesday. He said groups of up to 300 monks walked in single file past heavy concentrations of troops brought into the city to ward off protests. The action was interpreted as `` a pointed protest showing the feeling of the monks against the regime,'' the diplomat said.

<HEAD>Tossed in a Storm of Sequels, `The Abyss' Surfaces as an Original</HEAD>

 `` The Abyss'' could well be this summer's most ambitious, most problematic and, finally, most fascinating movie. `` The Abyss'' features no major stars, and while the rest of the film season has unfolded nearly seamlessly, this $ 43 million project was a magnet for miscues. It missed its original release date by a month, and because its rough cut ran 40 minutes long, a number of important expository and spectacular effects scenes were cut. But 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>'s `` The Abyss'' finally arrived, opening Wednesday on 1,550 screens. The cast and crew of this technically uncompromising adventure movie endured 3 -LCB- months of principal filming, 40 percent of it underwater. It stars <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Right Stuff'' -RRB- and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastrantonio </PERSON> -LRB- `` January Man'' -RRB-. So elaborate is the film's look and sound that almost everyone from director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> to sound mixer <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Orloff </PERSON> labored seven days a week, every week, throughout the first half of 1989. The final print of `` The Abyss'' was completed just hours before its first media preview, on July 28. `` The ringing sound of hysteria was always just around the corner,'' said <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, the writer and director of such acclaimed and personal techno-thrillers as `` The Terminator'' and `` Aliens.'' `` It seems t cut is a crucial sequence explaining that the story's underwater aliens are worried about nuclear war. That's why the sub crashes, the hurricane suddenly materializes and a now deleted tidal-wave assault develops. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> had a huge story to tell,'' <PERSON> Mastrantonio </PERSON> said. `` And there's a whole lot that's been cut. But given the time limitations of any normal film ... I think that he's told it cohesively.'' <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> say, too, they have succeeded in assembling a persuasive and cautionary tale about common people facing uncommon circumstances. `` A film should always try to take somebody somewhere, whether it's emotionally or physically transporting one to another place,'' <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> said. `` I see this as much of an emotional journey as a physical one. `` The great thing about film is that you can really do anything. You can show the biggest, most spectacular thing in the world, and in the next split second you can focus down to the most microcosmic human moment. `` The ocean is for many people a great primal fear,'' the director said. `` It's a very powerful thing, it can be incredibly fickle _ weather and currents can turn on you instantly _ but it's also the source of life and a place of incredible wonder.

 A small earthquake centered in a remote southern section of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bernardino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> was barely felt in nearby desert resort communities Wednesday, authorities said. `` I did n't feel a thing and did n't hear about any telephone calls,'' said a police dispatcher in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, about 10 miles away from the epicenter. The 6:42 a.m. temblor measured 3.3 on the Richter scale, and its epicenter was pinpointed near the forest's southern boundary, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>.

Spokeswoman Sue <PERSON> Nava </PERSON> said the 9:28 a.m. MDT quake, measuring 3.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, was centered seven miles south-southeast of Beaver. On Tuesday, a strong earthquake struck the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, 400 miles north of the quake near <LOCATION> Anza </LOCATION>. That 1:13 a.m. temblor had a magnitude of 5.2. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude, or the height of quake-generated shock waves recorded on a seismograph. Some experts say the actual amount of energy released may be 30 times greater. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe damage.

 The mother of a Domino's Pizza driver who was killed when his truck crashed has made a video for Domino's franchise holders asking them to consider the hazards their drivers face trying to beat the clock `` It's really to make an impact on them, on the danger aspect and the safety aspect,'' <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> said Wednesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> said she agreed to make the video when she and the pizza-maker came to an understanding after they `` agreed to disagree'' about the company's 30-minute delivery guarantee that she has campaigned to have scrapped. The video was shot at her home last weekend in anticipation of the company's annual meeting of franchise owners in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> this week, but spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said it could not be edited in time. Instead, it will be used as part of training materials for the company based at <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, he said. The video evolved out of talks Mrs. <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> has had with company officials since the June 3 death of her son, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Colson </PERSON>, 17. His company-owned truck hit a utility pole along a wet highway near <LOCATION> Mooresville </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. He was delivering a pizza at the time, and his mother believes the pressure to get it to the customer on time contributed to the accident. `` Domino's contacted me and we sat down and had some discusssion,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON>, a resident of suburban <LOCATION> Plainfield </LOCATION>. `` They had mentioned that -LRB- the video -RRB- as a possibility, and would I be interested? I thought it was some way I could make a contribution. Mrs. <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> said the small amount she was paid for making the video would be used to buy a marker for her son's grave. She would not say how much she was paid. `` The people I have talked to are very sincere,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Boutros </PERSON> said. `` That was a big factor why I decided to go ahead and work with them.'' Domino's has started an advertising campaign in which 21 million box lids are printed with a safety message from company President <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. In his message, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> says a Domino's pizza is usually ready for delivery within 12 minutes of receipt of the order. That leaves drivers 18 minutes to get to a customer's home. Delivery areas average two miles or less, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> says. `` Incidentally, if for some reason we miss our 30-minute guarantee, we pay the $ 3 refund, never the delivery person,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> adds in the message. Domino's also asks its customers to call a toll-free number to report driving incidents involving company employees.

 The stock market's recent climb toward record highs is worrying some investors who wonder whether the elevation in stock prices will be followed by a plunge like the October 1987 crash. Nearly a third of the paper value of stocks was wiped out in the crash and the weeks preceding it. With the market on a path remarkably similar to the one it followed the months before the crash, comparisons to 1987 are being drawn. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.18 points on Tuesday to finish at 2,699.17, approaching the record 2,722.42 close of Aug. 25, 1987. Today the Dow was up 3.60 at 2,702.77 at 1:30 p.m. EDT. The current rally's apologists point to dissimilarities in market conditions between then and now that they contend should lead to a much happier outcome this time. `` The current financial environment bears little resemblance to the fall of 1987,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, an analyst at the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` At that time, long-term bond interest rates exceeded 10 percent and were rising. Today those rates are down near 8 percent and have been falling. `` In the fall of 1987 the dollar was plunging to new lows. So far this year the dollar has been rising.'' In addition, analysts say, improvements in corporate health in the past two years may make a sharp downturn less likely. Corporate profits, the traditional base on which stock prices rest, have increased by as much as 65 to 70 percent. In other words, stock prices, in relation to the earnings of the companies they represent, appear nowhere near as overextended as they were in 1987. The 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average traded at about 20 times earnings in August 1987. Lately this price-earnings ratio has been about 12-1, a much more moderate level by historical standards. Takeovers and buyouts of corporations, which gave investors a reason to put extra-high values on stocks before the crash, are as rampant as ever in the 1989 marketplace. Bids for companies using borrowed money continue to put a burden of debt on the economy that worries skeptics, who argue that many of the apparent lessons of the crash have been forgotten or ignored. Still, active investors who watch their holdings rise in value because of buyout news or rumors find it hard to see the takeover trend in a negative light. `` It seems there are n't as many stocks to go around as there used to be,'' observed <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Janus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of mutual funds in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, in a recent report to shareholders. `` What's left is worth more.'' Professional traders engaged in large-scale computer trading strategies, often painted as primary villains during the crash, also still are very much in evidence. As in the early stages of 1987, they lately have been credited on several occasions with helping to drive stock prices higher through their so-called index arbitrage activity. In a market downturn, their critics say, their presence could make things worse. However, one computerized strategy known as portfolio insurance has not made much of a comeback since the market collapse, when it failed to deliver all its promised benefits as a hedging method. `` That's the one good thing we could say about the crash,'' declared <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Legg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It helped get rid of the portfolio insurance people.'' Should another overwhelming selloff hit the markets now, a series of measures known as `` circuit breakers'' has been adopted since the crash that would provide for automatic trading halts at predetermined points. It remains unknown how well these would work in practice _ whether halts in trading would help restore order or perversely work to prolong the agony. Hardly anybody is especially eager to find out.

 About 260 American dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government personnel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who were evacuated from that country two months ago have been authorized to return, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today.

But she said the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is continuing to recommend that Americans defer non-essential travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> until further notice. The dependents were ordered home on June 7 in the wake of `` indiscriminate firing'' by Chinese troops on a compound for diplomats and other foreign residents.

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will help free Western hostages if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> releases an abducted Shiite Moslem cleric and if four Iranians missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, long thought to be dead, are located, a <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspaper said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Abrar </ORGANIZATION>, the Farsi-language paper, did not mention a condition set by the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday: freeing billions of dollars in Iranian assets the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> froze a decade ago. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Tuesday the assets, which include arms and military equipment ordered before the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> revolution, could not be linked to the hostage issue. Sixteen Western captives are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. <ORGANIZATION> Kayhan </ORGANIZATION>, another Iranian daily, said Wednesday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would rather `` wash its hands'' of its assets than compromise its `` ideological principles,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. It quoted <PERSON> Abrar </PERSON> as saying: `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has repeatedly announced its readiness to exert its influence ... to help solve the hostage issue in response to any sign of goodwill by the West.'' The four Iranians are believed to have been killed when they disappeared in 1982. President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> is seen as a pragmatist who wants improved relations with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as a means of getting help to rebuild from the eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. He is opposed by the radical faction of Interior Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohtashemi </PERSON>, to which compromise with the West is anathema.

<TEXT>
 As <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> work toward a joint space venture, two veteran pilots plan to link the two countries the old-fashioned way: by balloon. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, a record-breaking balloon pilot, said Wednesday he will team up with Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Gherman </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> for the 1,400-mile trip from <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, across the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, 53, was the backup man for <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagarin </PERSON>, the first man in space on April 12, 1961, and <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> became the world's first multiple-orbit astronaut by circling the Earth 17 times in the spaceship <ORGANIZATION> Vostok </ORGANIZATION> 2 on Aug. 6-7, 1961. `` We're not trying to give the world a political message for doing our flight,'' said <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, 50. `` It's just an interesting sporting objective. `` I'm one of the world's great cowards, so we have tried to remove as much of the risk as possible,'' he added. `` But it's quite a long flight, a lot of it over the sea. Depending on the weather, the flight will begin as early as the second week of September, and is expected to take four days. The two men will travel beneath the 60,000-cubic-foot hot air balloon in a bright yellow, 100-pound gondola bristling with satellite navigational equipment and radios to communicate with <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>'s home base in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, a Soviet base and air traffic controllers. <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, who at 25 was the youngest person in space, was selected by the Soviets from among 200 volunteers for the balloon flight. A similar process of weeding through volunteers was undertaken to select <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first cosmonaut for an eight-day mission to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space station Mir in 1991. Medical tests on 150 finalists began Monday. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> has yet to meet his copilot. `` <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> has a tremendous amount of experience in many things, but probably not ballooning,'' he said. `` I'll take over for the takeoff and landing, which are the tricky bits. Control in the air is fairly easy. `` I've been learning little scraps of Russian. I do n't know what <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>'s English is like, but I'm sure we'll get by.'' Non-stop gas balloon flights between <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> last took place around the turn of the century when Count <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaulx </PERSON> made several flights from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. In 1900, he smashed the long-distance balloon record by floating 1,193 miles from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Korosticheff </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> claims to be the first balloonist to cross the <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alps </LOCATION> in the early 1970s. He lost out on the first successful trans-Atlantic helium balloon crossing when his craft ditched 108 miles off the western French coast. Weeks later, in July 1978, an American team set the record. A balloon designer and manufacturer, <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> approached Soviet authorities two years ago and got the OK for his West-East adventure in July 1988. A balloon factory that has since opened in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> will begin turning out Cameron-designed balloons by the end of the year to be used to carry tourists on sightseeing trips over historical sites in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, he said. Later on Wednesday, a second British-Soviet balloon venture was announced by Thunder and Colt, a British balloon manufacturer. The company said it is building a hot air balloon for a flight from its headquarters at <LOCATION> Oswestry </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Shropshire </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Minsk </LOCATION>. No date has been set for the flight, which is still seeking financial sponsorship, said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, the company's marketing director. The Thunder and Colt balloon would be flown by two British businessmen, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, the company said.

 As grave robbers go, <PERSON> Grandison </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was pretty good. Purchased as a slave in 1852 by the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was a `` resurrection man,'' who dug up new graves in black cemeteries, cracked open the crude wooden coffins, bagged the contents and delivered them to the medical college for dissection by students. A century after a law change that made the craft obsolete, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' handiwork is coming to light as workers renovate the basement of the old medical college building. This week, about 40 boxes of bones from 19th century dissections were taken to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to be studied at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for insights on the health, nutrition and lifestyles of Georgians in the 1800s. Campus officials are unsure how many bodies are in the boxes. Student volunteers also collected coins, buttons, bottles, surgical instruments, test tubes and clothing from the earthen basement of the 1835 building. `` I can think of no other archaeological find in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> remotely like it,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> anthropologist. `` There may be other medical colleges that have things like this in their cellars, but they have n't been discovered.'' Records by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, dean of faculty at the college in the mid-1800s, indicate that grave-robbing was a booming business until 1887, when the laws changed. Grave-robbing was often the only way medical schools could get around laws that equated human dissection with desecration. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> bought 2,000 gallons of whiskey in the 1850s and made references to transactions such as, `` Joe for subject, $ 10.'' The `` subjects'' were preserved in <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>'s whiskey until the time came for them to provide medical students vital lessons on the basics of human anatomy. The bodies were mostly blacks because `` when you have a large population of a depressed class, you're going to have fewer problems robbing their graves than the mayor of <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moores </PERSON>, a hematologist and historian of the medical college. A manuscript on the resurrection man's career by the late <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a professor of anatomy at the college, recounts how <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> performed his job, digging into graves by moonlight, smashing the crude wooden coffins with an ax, removing the `` subject'' and placing it in a sack, which he carried to the college in a horse-drawn cart. Sometimes, on his return, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> would stop for a drink. One tale recounts how a student once removed the corpse while <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was in the saloon and climbed in the sack. He moaned in a ghostly voice when <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> came back to the cart: `` <PERSON> Grandison </PERSON>, I'm cold Buy me a drink.'' Legend says <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> replied: `` Get your own drink.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> continued to work for the college after the Civil War provided his freedom, at a salary of $ 10 to $ 15 a month. He retired as a janitor at the college in 1905 on a pension of $ 10 a month. <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> State researchers believe the bones `` will cover the entire period the medical college was in that building, from the 1830s to the early 1900s.'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said the remains eventually will be returned to the medical college, where they will be cremated next spring with the remains of current dissections and buried with them in an annual memorial service.

 A bomb blew apart a New Delhi-bound bus near this northern town Wednesday, killing at least 12 people and injuring 35, police said. No one took responsibility for the attack. However, Sikh militants trying to form an independent state have planted many such bombs in the past. Authorities said they believed a time bomb was used in the attack. The blast tore through the state-owned bus two miles outside Karnal in the northern state of <LOCATION> Haryana </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. `` I thought it was a head-on collision with another bus,'' said passenger O.P. <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, who was treated for shock. `` Then I saw doors and window blown apart.'' It was not known how many people were on the bus, which normally carries at least 60 passengers. Nine people were killed in the blast and three others died at a hospital in <LOCATION> Karnal </LOCATION>, said police inspector <PERSON> Rajinder </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. The Press Trust of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> said 18 people were killed. The bus, traveling from the resort town of <LOCATION> Kasauli </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, was just entering <PERSON> Karnal </PERSON>, about 95 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` If the explosion occurred five minutes later, the bus would have been in the middle of Karnal and scores of people would have died,'' said police inspector <PERSON> Mehar </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>. The bomb probably was put on board at <LOCATION> Ambala </LOCATION>, about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Karnal </LOCATION>, where the bus had stopped for a few minutes, he said. `` Four passengers got off there,'' he said. `` Also, the journey from <LOCATION> Ambala </LOCATION> -LRB- to Karnal -RRB- is about an hour, and most of these time bombs are set for 60 minutes,'' <PERSON> Lal </PERSON> said. Sikh militants launched a campaign in 1982 to set up an independent nation in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, where Sikhs hold a slight majority over Hindus. The violence has been largely concentrated there, but the militants have mounted periodic attacks in nearby states and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. At least 1,116 people have been killed by <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> radicals in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> so far this year, according to police reports. On Tuesday, three Sikh militants killed six people when they sprayed gunfire on a crowd leaving a movie theater in Jammy, a city in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> neighboring the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, authorities said. The army was called out as a precautionary measure Wednesday and an indefinite curfew imposed there, city commissioner <PERSON> Vijay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakaya </PERSON> said. Many Sikhs, who make up 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, say they have been discriminated against by the nation's 82 percent Hindu majority.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsett </PERSON>, a small-town principal who has paddled hundreds of kids for discipline in 24 years as an educator, was shocked when he opened a letter and read he is on <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s child abuser list. He will appeal, but if unsuccessful, his name will remain for 50 years on the state Child Abuse Registry, which is confidential but is used for state-required screenings of day-care employees and other child caretakers. `` I'm disappointed that something like this is happening,'' <PERSON> Winsett </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` I do n't think what I did was child abuse in any sense and when they say if a mark is left on 24 hours they're going to put you on the list ... that's nonsense.'' <PERSON> Winsett </PERSON> is among dozens of school administrators put on the abuser list in what an attorney contends is part of an unofficial effort by the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to stop paddling in schools. The list contains hundreds of thousands of names of child abusers and those suspected or accused of child abuse. Two unidentified middle school officials from <LOCATION> north </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Monday asked the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to review a lower court decision upholding the state decision to put them on the list because of paddlings administered in 1987. The court is in recess until Aug. 31. The lower court's 2-1 decision in April conflicts with comparable rulings elsewhere in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that a bruise alone is insufficient evidence that a paddling has degenerated into abuse, according to <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, general counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teaching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Profession-National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` But for the existence of a bruise -LRB- in the north <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cases -RRB- there would be no indication of excessive force,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said Tuesday. The state HRS department denies <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>'s allegation that it is singling out educators in its investigations. `` We do n't have a position on corporal punishment,'' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Konicki </PERSON>, an HRS spokesman, said. `` We do have a position on injury.'' Until this year, state statute required local school districts to include paddling as a disciplinary option. Earlier this spring, however, lawmakers agreed to leave the decision at the local level. Since Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> signed the legislation in late June, at least seven districts have banned paddling. <PERSON> Winsett </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Stambaugh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Auburndale </LOCATION> and an administrator for 16 years, said he has never been a strong advocate of paddling but that many parents in his area support it as a disciplinary measure. He said he has paddled hundreds of youngsters. A day or two after he paddled a teen-age boy who had gotten into trouble repeatedly, an HRS investigator asked <PERSON> Winsett </PERSON> if he had paddled the student and asked about bruises left on the student, <PERSON> Winsett </PERSON> said. Weeks later, <PERSON> Winsett </PERSON> received a certified letter in June and found out that his name had been added to the list of confirmed child abuse cases. `` That was ridiculous,'' he said. `` I just do n't understand how anybody can do that in this country ... without a trial or anything. `` I thought every man was innocent until proven guilty. I never had a hearing, but when I get the letter it says I'm a child abuser,'' <PERSON> Winsett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s school administrators are frightened by an HRS trend he says began in mid-1987. `` It's had a real chilling effect,'' he said. `` It's a severe penalty to be labeled a child abuser.'' But <PERSON> Konicki </PERSON> said that only educators who go too far have any need for concern. `` Teachers in general do n't feel under siege by HRS,'' he said. <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> estimated that 50 to 60 school employees throughout <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> are trying to remove their names from the registry. At least 10 exhausted administrative avenues and went to the courts. None of those cases was pursued by police, prosecutors or state licensing officials, he said. <PERSON> Konicki </PERSON> said bruising is only one indicator of excessive force and added that it's rare that a teacher is confirmed as a child abuser. In cases where it is confirmed, `` the bruises were not incidental but -LRB- were -RRB- severe deep bruises,'' he said. `` There are dozens and hundreds of teachers around this state that administer corporal punishment in a way that does not batter children,'' <PERSON> Konicki </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, senior human services specialist for HRS, agreed. `` Every child bruises differently than any other child,'' <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> said. `` What the investigator has to determine is whether or not that bruise is the result of excessive corporal punishment.''

 <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s career had fallen from the heights of <LOCATION> Beatlemania </LOCATION> to `` its lowest ebb'' when he asked producer <PERSON> Chips </PERSON> <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> to salvage it with an album the drummer now is trying to keep out of stores, <PERSON> Moman </PERSON>'s attorney says. <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> wants to put out the album, recorded more than two years ago but never released, to coincide with <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concert tour. The former Beatle says he's unhappy with his drumming on the recordings and the release could hurt his reputation. Release of the album was temporarily blocked last month by <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. A hearing on <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>'s suit against <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> and a College Park record company is scheduled Aug. 22. <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Moman </LOCATION> in 1987 to rescue his sagging career, according to a counterclaim filed this week by an attorney for the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, producer. The two agreed to make three albums, according to <PERSON> Moman </PERSON>. `` When plaintiff <PERSON> Starr </PERSON> sought out defendant <PERSON> Moman </PERSON>, plaintiff's career was at a standstill and at its lowest ebb,'' the counterclaim said `` Plaintiff, like others before him, sought out defendant to salvage his career as an artist. `` <PERSON> Moman </PERSON> agreed to help, but in return expected an album which would produce a profit,'' the document said. `` Moman is not now nor was he at the time of the fi everything else which is automated is working fine,'' he said.

 A suicide bomber attacked an Israeli convoy in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Wednesday, wounding six people in what the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> called a `` down payment'' for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of a Shiite Moslem cleric <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> clergyman drove the explosives-laden pickup truck. It also said the seizure of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> hampered efforts to free the 16 Western captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, eight of whom are Americans. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is believed to be an umbrella organization for groups holding most of the hostages. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to pursue every diplomatic channel to win freedom for te American hostages, but said there would be no `` trading off or negotiating.'' A <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> newspaper said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would help free hostages if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and if four Iranians missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1982, believed long dead, were located. On Tuesday, another <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> paper said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would help if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> released $ 2 billion in Iranian assets frozen a decade ago when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was seized. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, spiritual adviser of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, said of the bombing: `` We tell <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> this is a down payment. Much more will follow.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, whose name means <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION>, said the suicide bomber was <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Asaad </PERSON> <PERSON> Birro </PERSON>, a 24-year-old Lebanese Shiite cleric from the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said two people were in the pickup, which exploded at midmorning in the buffer zone the Israelis control just north of the border. Five Israeli soldiers and a member of the allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia were reported wounded. <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coordinator for south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Television </LOCATION> the Israelis would retaliate, but did not say when or how. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> as it deals with all the organizations which threaten the normal life of the security zone,'' he said. `` Violence has two edges and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will retaliate in one way or another ... in due time, in a place it will choose.'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tofaili </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> leader, said there would be more attacks and the seizure of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> would `` mushroom into an explosive volcano in the face of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.'' Israeli commandos abducted <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, 33, and two aides from the southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> village of Jibchit on July 28. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has offered to trade him and its estimated 300-400 Shiite prisoners for three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the Western hostages. A statement released by the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> information center described the seizure of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, who was affiliated with the organization, as a `` terrorist crime of piracy.'' It reiterated previous rejections of the Israeli exchange proposal. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has urged hostage-holding factions to negotiate a trade through the international <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. `` The Zionist enemy has suffered a bitter dismay because of his failure to achieve his objectives from the crime of abducting <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemy after this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release the Israeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked. `` Moreover, the refusal of the enemy to release <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and his two relatives, and his linkage of the problem of the Zionist POWs with that of the hostages, might hurt the West and further complicate the hostage issue.'' The statement said `` efforts for the release of the Western hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are passing through their greatest setback because of the foolhardiness committed by the racist Zionists who appear perfectly willing to sacrifice all others for their selfish interests.'' <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said the West should force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, and described <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s claims about statements the cleric made under interrogation as `` false and misleading.'' Officials in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> have said <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> confessed under interrogation to helping plan attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the abduction Feb. 17, 1988 of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> while he was on <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> duty in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' captors said they hanged the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer July 31 in retaliation for <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>'s abduction. His wife and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> say they believe <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> is dead, but the question of when he died has not been resolved. Some reports say he was killed last year. A police spokesman in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said the car bombing was reported at 9:30 a.m. -LRB- 2:30 a.m. EDT -RRB- on a road near the Christian towns of <LOCATION> Marjayoun </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Qleiaa </LOCATION>, both 5 miles north of the Israeli border. Israeli soldiers and the allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia, patrol the zone, which varies in depth from about 6 to 10 miles. Two jeeps, a tank, two armored personnel carriers and a halftrack made up the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> convoy, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said. It released a color photograph of a Birro, the suicide driver, behind a desk flanked by flags of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Behind him were a poster of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who became <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> died in June. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> said the attack was carried out to `` declare our loyalty to the path of Imam <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> and his successor <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Government Says Guerrillas Violating Moslem Ban on Killing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said Wednesday that Moslem guerrillas were violating Islamic law by killing civilians with rocket attacks during the current holy month. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> criticized the guerrillas for calling themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, while rocketing the capital during the month of <LOCATION> Muharram </LOCATION>. `` They claim to be the advocates of Islam and they pay no heed to these holy days, and they fire rockets on civilian targets and houses and they claim they are trying to kill communists,'' he said. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said Moslems mourning the death of a grandson of the prophet <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> during this month are not permitted to kill other Moslems. However, Moslems always are under a religious ban against killing other Moslems. Rockets have been crashing into <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> almost daily since late June. The Soviet-backed Marxist government blames the guerrillas for the attacks. Most of the rockets have struck civilian areas. At least 281 people have been killed and 745 injured in the rocket attacks and a car bombing, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources. On Wednesday, no rockets were reported to have hit <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Intermittent thuds from government artillery could be heard, however, and missiles heading for targets outside the capital could be seen flashing across the sky. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the guerrillas killed 16 civilians in a rocket barrage late Tuesday. One of 10 rockets hit a military weapons and ammunition depot in northwest <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, setting off a chain reaction of explosions that lasted for 3 -LCB- hours. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said one man who lived about 500 yards away was killed. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said 1,200 people were evacuated from the area, but he said the 16 casualties he reported were caused by rockets that hit elsewhere. In other military action over the previous 24 hours, air force planes destroyed a 1 -LCB- - mile guerrilla arms convoy in <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> province south of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said He said trucks that tried to return to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where the most powerful rebel forces are headquartered, were also destroyed. <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> had no further details, and the report could not be independently confirmed.

 City money wo n't go to groups other than health clinics serving illegal aliens in an effort to discourage the immigrants from coming to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> decided. The council agreed Tuesday to withhold funds from such groups as Boys and <ORGANIZATION> Girls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YMCA </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feedback </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Councilman <PERSON> Orville </PERSON> <PERSON> Amburgey </PERSON> said the city has become a mecca for illegal aliens taking advantage of the assistance programs. `` We did some checking and found out the ` coyotes' who guide illegal immigrants into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> are telling them that if they come to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> they can get employment, food, shelter and clothing,'' <PERSON> Amburgey </PERSON> said. The 3-2 vote for the measure drew immediate criticism. `` It is ill-advised, ill-conceived and very imprudent,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is really undue government interference into the affairs of voluntary agencies.

The city gave more than $ 266,000 in Community Development Block Grant funds and general revenue sharing funds to 30 organizations last year, the city manager's office said. Council member <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornbuckle </PERSON>, who voted against the decision, said many non-profit agencies' budgets leave little room for expenditures to screen clients. `` This will certainly create another headache,'' said attorney <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurado </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` It seems to be another tactic to get rid of illegal immigrants, and is clearly going to be discriminatory.''

<TEXT>
 Governing party leader <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> became prime minister Wednesday after an unprecedented battle in parliament, and he immediately began trying to build public support by naming two women to the Cabinet. Women voters, angry over a new sales tax and a sex scandal involving <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s predecessor, were seen as a major factor in the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s poor showing in parliamentary elections July 23. In that vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost their majority in the upper house for the first time in their 34-year history. The opposition Socialists delayed <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s election by supporting <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> on Wednesday. The Liberal Democrats hold a majority in the more powerful lower house, which chose <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>. Under the constitution, the lower house decision prevailed. It was the first time in 41 years the chambers had clashed over leadership of the government. `` Today, the door was only half opened, but I am determined to continue to work to fully open this door some day,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>. Socialist Secretary-General <PERSON> Tsuruo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that `` politically, the upper house vote has proven that this administration is only half an administration, and <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> is only half a prime minister.'' <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> told reporters the upper house's move was a `` severe consequence of our election defeat'' July 23. `` There are many difficulties awaiting the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and I will try to work hard and express my frank feelings to the people,'' he said. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> became <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s third prime minister in 10 weeks. <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resigned in June to take responsibility for an influence-peddling scandal involving the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> conglomerate. His replacement, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, stepped down after 69 days amid allegations he kept paid mistresses. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, 58, considered a reform-minded politician, was chosen to lead the party's rebuilding efforts because of his relative youth and non-involvement in the Recruit scandal, which tainted most senior leaders. He was chosen party leader Tuesday. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> has acknowledged receiving about $ 110,000 in political donations from Recruit but said they were legal. The company has been accused of giving political donations and selling bargain-priced stock to leading politicians in exchange for political favors. <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON> was elected only to fill the remaining three months of <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s original term. Whether he can keep the post after October depends on how well he can establish a power base and brighten the party's image. In addition to lacking his own power base in the party, <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, a former education minister, has little experience in the crucial areas of foreign affairs and finance. The 20-member Cabinet was carefully crafted to distribute posts among major party factions controlled by senior <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, despite <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>'s comment Tuesday that factions are `` an evil.'' His new Cabinet includes the first woman non-politician to serve as a government minister _ <PERSON> Sumiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Takahara </PERSON>, an economics specialist who became head of the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Another woman, lawmaker <PERSON> Mayumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriyama </PERSON>, will head the <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eiji </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employers </ORGANIZATION>' Associations, told <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> that two women in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> would contribute significantly to the revitalization of the party Homemakers were particularly incensed at the 3 percent sales tax passed in April. Five Cabinet posts went to the largest party faction, controlled by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, and four each to the next three largest factions. <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, most recently the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>' secretary-general, was named finance minister, while <PERSON> Hikaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, a former prosecutor, was given the important post of international trade minister <PERSON> Taro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakayama </PERSON>, a former doctor, was named foreign minister, and former <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Tokuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamashita </PERSON> was named chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary, the main government spokesman. <PERSON> Ichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozawa </PERSON> was named the new party secretary-general, and <PERSON> Shunjiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Karasawa </PERSON> became the new chairman of the party's decision-making Executive Council Both have acknowledged receiving legal donations from Recruit. Opposition politicians reveled in the upper house rejection of <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>, calling on the Liberal Democrats to dissolve the lower house for new elections and scrap the new sales tax. Business leaders, who traditionally support the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, urged the party to push forward with reforms.

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> has carried the mail for 31 years, and even his wife's illness could n't keep him away from a ceremony Wednesday for the centennial of the the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Letter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carriers </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, 56, and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> letter carrier <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Page </PERSON> delivered a 3-by-5-foot postcard to the ceremony outside the downtown post office. Stamps have been affixed at each of the 47 states where the postcard has been canceled, and it will be sent via Express Mail to the remaining states, ending up in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> on Aug. 30, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the postal workers' union in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>' wife of 40 years, <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, entered <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Wednesday for cancer treatment, but he said she insisted that he attend the ceremony. `` She did n't want me to miss it,'' <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said. `` I've been with her since she was 16.'' <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON>, whose route includes downtown <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, says one of the biggest changes since he began work has been the amount of mail. `` There's a lot more mail to be delivered _ I'd say at least triple,'' he said. `` There's heavier volume _ more magazines, more bulk business rate, which we have to have to stay alive. `` They told me 20 years ago it would be like this. That's why I never slowed down.'' The <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, native said he and seven of his eight brothers served in the armed forces and went to work for the federal government. `` I just love being in uniform,'' he said. He does n't even mind working in bad weather. `` I kind of enjoy it,'' he said. `` I get used to it _ even the rain. I put a cape on and look like <PERSON> Batman </PERSON>. People splash me, though. I think they want to see me duck under that cape.''

 To our great sorrow, another brutal attack was committed today close to our northern border.

 Israeli troops shot and killed a man and child in a Palestinian refugee camp Wednesday during demonstrations marking 20 months of the Arab rebellion, hospital officials said. A third <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was found dead, and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said he was killed by Israeli settlers. The deaths raised to 533 the number of Palestinians killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or settlers since the uprising began in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> in December 1987. Thirty-eight Israelis have died in the violence. Officials at <LOCATION> Shifa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> said 6-year-old <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazi </PERSON> <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON> and 23-year-old <PERSON> Ziad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Bannat </PERSON> were shot to death during daylong clashes in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Shati refugee camp. Hospital officials said <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON> was shot in the heart and quoted the boy's family as saying a soldier on a rooftop had fired at him. <PERSON> Bannat </PERSON> died later of gunshot wounds to the stomach and chest, the officials said. The army spokesman's office confirmed <PERSON> Salameh </PERSON>'s death but said he was 8. The office said <PERSON> Bannat </PERSON>'s body was taken from the hospital for burial before the army could confirm the cause of death and that it was checking further. Arab hospital reports said at least 19 Palestinians were wounded in Shati. Four other Palestianians were wounded elsewhere in the territories in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army confirmed five wounded and said it was checking other reports. The riots at Shati occurred as Palestinians throughout the occupied lands mounted a general strike to mark the end of the 20th month of their uprising against Israeli occupation. The territories were captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Shops and offices were closed, and public transportation was shut down. A nurse in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> said the body of 17-year-old <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesk </PERSON> was found on a major city thoroughfare near the Ansar Mosque. He had been shot twice in the head, the nurse said. Arab reporters said <PERSON> Mesk </PERSON> and several friends had been throwing stones at passing Israeli vehicles, including a state-run passenger bus and a car carrying Jewish settlers. Passengers from the bus opened fire as the youths fled, one of the youths told reporters. Also Wednesday, an Israeli infant died from wounds suffered in an exchange of gunfire between his father and soldiers, officials at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> said. The army said troops accidentally shot 19-month-old <PERSON> Itai </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON> on Tuesday night after his father, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Jewish settler, opened fire on an army patrol in a grove of trees. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said 30-year-old <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamtzani </PERSON> fired because he thought the soldiers were Palestinians lighting a firebomb. The father and a second son, 4-year-old <PERSON> Ordan </PERSON>, were wounded, the army said.

<HEAD>U.S. Economy Growing at Slower Pace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is still growing but at a slower pace, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a report economists interpreted as an indication the central bank had room to cut interest rates further. In a survey of economic conditions around the country, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> found that the `` nation's economy continues to grow slowly'' with weak auto sales, generally sluggish consumer spending and some declines in manufacturing output. The slowdown this year was caused in part by a yearlong battle waged by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to drive interest rates higher as a way of dampening demand and cooling off inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> switched course in June, however, and began nudging interest rates lower in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession. Many analysts interpreted the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s new economic survey as an indication that the central bank, while not overly worried about an imminent economic downturn, was ready to lower interest rates further if the economy showed continued weakness. `` This report says that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> believes the economy is slowing down but there is no imminent danger of a recession and inflation does n't look like as big a problem as it did a few months ago,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <PERSON> DRI-McGraw </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said that while the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> would ease interest rates further in coming months, `` they are not in a big hurry to do it.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm, noted that the bond market initially sagged when the report was released because traders had been anticipating a gloomier Fed assessment of growth prospects. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will still be pushing interest rates lower in coming months but only as inflationary pressures abate. `` The economic reports and this outlook suggest that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s soft landing has been achieved,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> The central bank has been trying to slow the economy enough to dampen inflationary pressures without toppling the country into a downturn. Fed interest rate decisions are made by the 12-member <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, composed of members of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board and the presidents of five of the 12 regional banks. The policy-makers meet eight times a year, with the next session scheduled for Aug. 22. To prepare for those meetings, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> surveys the regional banks about economic conditions in their areas. Wednesday's report, known inside the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> as the `` beige book,'' is the latest compilation of those views. The report said retail sales were generally sluggish nationwide, with auto sales below last year's levels everywhere except <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a state where car sales have increased sharply. About the only strength nationwide in consumer spending over the summer has come in sales of women's clothing, the report said. Manufacturing activity varied from region to region with <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> reporting sluggish growth in new orders. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> reported weakness in orders for electronic components, while the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> regions reported some layoffs and plant closings related to cutbacks in auto production. Lumber sales were being bolstered by foreign demand in the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> districts, but logging restrictions were hurting lumber producers in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and North Central regions. Farmers were expecting good harvests in many parts of the nation but weather conditions were causing scattered problems, such as excess rain hurting production in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and a drought in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> likely lowering wheat yields in that state, the report said.

Role</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> met Wednesday with a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> delegation and rejected a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role in resolving the Cambodian war until the world body stops backing the guerrilla resistance. The pro-Vietnamese leader and more than a dozen Cabinet ministers and military chiefs held two hours of talks with the team, sent by an international conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The team arrived Monday to gather technical information for the possible formation of an international body to monitor the Vietnamese troop withdrawal and a proposed truce. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has promised to pull all of its troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> by the end of September. After the talks, <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> told reporters his government was helping the team because it did not want to block the peace process. He said this did not mean his government had accepted a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role in the process. `` We can not accept the role of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> continues to accept the role -LRB- of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- in any political issue of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We shall study the role of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> if the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> leaves the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> seat vacant,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> is the largest group in the three-party guerrilla coalition that holds <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'s seat in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> said he rejected a guerrilla offer that the <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government share the seat with the guerrillas. `` I said that I can not sit on the bloodied seat of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, using the name of the resistance government. The <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> talks, which opened July 30, have not produced substantial progress because <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> rejects guerrilla demands that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> be included in a transitional government. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians before <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> invaded in late 1978, ousted it from power, and installed the current <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> government. The 15-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> team, led by Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Datset </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, is to visit about eight provinces during its weeklong tour. On Wednesday, the team visited northeastern <LOCATION> Stung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Treng </LOCATION> province. On Tuesday, it inspected what is expected to be a major route for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s pullout, Highway No. 1 from <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, formerly <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>. The team includes experts in aviation, communications, engineering and other fields. They said the task of monitoring the pullout and supervising the peace would be complex in such an undeveloped country. Wing Cmdr. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Weekes </PERSON>, an aviation expert from <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, noted <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> has few main highways and that many roads are impassable during the monsoon season. Another expert, who requested anonymity, said the scarcity of telephones and other communications would make it difficult to report truce violations. He said the monitoring body must be much larger than the several hundred members suggested by <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> if the predominantly jungle war is to be kept in check.

 A convicted killer said he was depressed when he won a reprieve from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair and `` can hardly wait'' for his execution. `` I do not have a death wish,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> said. `` I would say I do n't care about living as distinguished from I want to die.'' `` I can hardly wait to sit in Old Sparky -LRB- the electric chair -RRB-. I'm curious about it,'' <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON>, 60, said in an interview Tuesday with The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> State Prison. <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> was condemned for the 1984 shooting death of <PERSON> Laureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> during a robbery at her lingerie store. He was sentenced to death after firing his public defender and pleading guilty. He also admitted an earlier murder in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` I'm not the least bit concerned about electrocution. I think it's spiffy,'' <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> said. `` If you've got to go _ why not? It's better than AIDS, better than cancer of the colon, better than slipping into senility day by day. I can think of a lot more ways I'd rather not die,'' he said. <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> said he was `` let down'' when public defenders won an indefinite stay from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on July 18 just five hours before he was to be strapped into the electric chair. <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> denied he was legally insane or incompetent, as defense lawyers maintained. `` I might be wacko ... but within the legal definition, I'm completely confident I know what I'm doing,'' <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> said The inmate said he could commit suicide in his cell if he wanted to, but does n't want to. He said the problem with suicide is that people think the victim is unable to cope with life. `` I just do n't care to cope,'' he said. <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> served seven years in the Marines and saw combat duty in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> before he was dishonorably discharged in 1953. He was married and divorced and spent 20 years in prison on rape and burglary convictions before his release in 1978. <PERSON> Hamblen </PERSON> said he returned to crime in 1984 when he killed a woman he described as a `` beer-drinking buddy'' in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. He was fleeing the murder charge when he robbed Mrs. <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>' store.

 Panamanian military authorities arrested two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> on Wednesday but they were later released after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops then blocked the entrance to the area, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offiicals said. Army Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military policeman was detained by members of the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> around 11 a.m. in the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> area, where Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has offices. A second military policeman was also detained when he entered the building where the first soldier was being held, Ms. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. The action was in apparent retaliation for the detention by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities of 29 Panamanians, including nine military personnel, on Tuesday. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces secured the entry and exit to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>. ... Two PDF personnel on police duty at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>'s front gate were asked to surrender their weapons, and they did so. They were then taken into custody by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces,'' Ms. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> is a joint-use area that includes barracks for Panamanian troops, a building where <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has an office, several <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> offices, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval station and a golf course and clubs used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel. Sources said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, was not at his office in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> today.

<HEAD>Critics Charge VIP Riders Taking Money from Historical Programs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his family like riding government-owned horses at <ORGANIZATION> Manassas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battlefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, but such VIP privilege may harm the park's historical interpretive efforts, employees say <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his three children _ <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 15, <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON>, 12, and <PERSON> Corinne </PERSON>, 10 _ are regular visitors to the park, according to the vice president's office. The family is accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> agents and local law enforcement officials. They ride the park's nine horses _ normally used for park security patrols and not available for public use. `` You have the vice president riding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government horses at a park that is designed for historical preservation and in which the staff is trying to control recreational use,'' said former park historian <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON>, now with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Division of Parks. `` You have money going into maintaining these government horses ... while anyone can see the woeful condition of the rest of the operation. What type of message does that send to the public?'' Park Supervisor <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Apschnikat </PERSON> said that while the park's horses are not for public use, the visits by <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his family are `` a different situation'' and the use of national park facilities by members of the executive branch is common. Other guest riders have included <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who has been riding twice, according to park spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON>, the vice president's press secretary, said he was unaware of complaints about the Quayles' horseback riding. `` He enjoys it ... and says it's quite beautiful,'' <PERSON> Beckwith </PERSON> said. Some park staff members and <PERSON> Hennessey </PERSON>, an expert on the Civil War battles of First and <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manassas </ORGANIZATION>, see the VIP trail rides principally as a symptom of a horse program that's grown larger than needed _ thus draining resources from interpretive services and preservation activities. `` This is the worst year in the three years I've been here,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Raus </PERSON>, who heads the battlefield's interpretive staff. `` We do n't have the staff to operate the programs we once did. It definitely has been frustrating.'' The park, site of the two Bull Run battles in which more than 22,000 soldiers died, has had to scale back its interpretive programs. <PERSON> Raus </PERSON> said his department's budget has decreased from about 15 percent to 11 percent of the park's $ 933,000 budget this fiscal year. The department has laid off three employees since 1988 and suspended some bus tours and living history exhibits. New signs that tell the story of those who fought and died here in July 1861 and August 1862 sit in storage, while the old system of recorded messages that explained what occurred at specific sites is mute. `` People come in and say, ` we ca n't understand what went on,''' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Krick </PERSON>, a history major working this summer as a park interpreter. `` They ask, ` Where's the bus tour from last year, what happened to the voice boxes?''' In addition, battlefield sites are in need of repair. <PERSON> Apschnikat </PERSON> said the cutbacks stem from increases in the park's fixed operating costs, especially salaries, coupled with a 1,200-acre expansion during the past five years Park officials said it was impossible to determine the amount of time a specific ranger or other employee might spend on a horse-related project. `` You see the horse program growing and growing and growing, and everything else going down hill,'' said park administrative officer <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>. `` You see things falling apart, you must ask where is the money going.''

<HEAD>Bonn Urges East Germans to Leave Embassies in East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Wednesday appealed to East Germans hoping to obtain exit visas to stop occupying West German embassies in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. As many as 400 East Germans were reported to be holed up in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s embassies in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, and at the permanent mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The problem compelled <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to close its mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Tuesday. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, said relations between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have been improving in the past year and that the refugee situation `` is creating more problems than it is solving.'' A resolution of the problem has been complicated by the absence of many senior West German officials, who are on vacation, and by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s refusal to give exit visas to those occupying the embassies. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> pressed the West German view that East Germans wanting to emigrate should seek legal means of leaving the country to avoid damaging relations between the nations. He said the number of exit visas granted during the first six months of this year _ 46,434 _ exceeds the number allowed to emigrate in all of 1988. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> also said the number of East Germans granted visas for visits to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had increased by more than 9 percent this year. But he said West German officials recognized that `` the desire to leave will decrease only when democratic advancements and reforms are in place'' in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and he said no immediate efforts in that direction were visible. The West German appeal was issued after a special meeting of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s Cabinet early Wednesday. Only five of the 19 federal ministers were present. Many senior <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> officials, including <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, take their vacations in August. Due to the lack of a quorum, the Cabinet meeting was limited to advisory action. Inter-German Affairs Minister <PERSON> Dorothee </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilms </PERSON> has been criticized by West German newspapers for failing to return to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> to deal with the refugee problem. Her spokesman said Wednesday she was ending her vacation early and was heading back to the capital. East Germans began occupying the West German embassies nearly two weeks ago, apparently out of frustration over the outlook for emigrating through official channels. The East Germans, who numbered 131 at the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission when officials closed the premises, have said they will not leave until they are promised exit visas for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission would be reopened only when the federal government could ensure normal operations. The mission has functioned in place of a West German Embassy since diplomatic relations were established between the two German states in 1974. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> said those at the closed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> mission would be allowed to stay until they `` decide voluntarily to leave.'' Mission spokesman <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grashoff </PERSON> said that as of midday Wednesday, none had left.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday urged all American churches and other places of faith to offer `` a special prayer'' this weekend for the hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and for world peace. `` I just want to suggest that this weekend, each in our own way, that we say a prayer for the American hostages, for their family and indeed for world peace,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I believe in prayer,'' said the president, who delivered the plea at the outset of a private meeting with Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` So I would ask the churches and other places of faith to say a special prayer this weekend,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, an Episcopalian and regular church-goer. Law later called it `` a wonderful thing.'' The cardinal, a personal friend of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s, said he offered a prayer before the private lunch with the president, chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. Law said they discussed not only `` the terrible situation of the hostages,'' but `` the broader issue of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' `` The hostage situation has to be seen in the context of the question of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> as a whole,'' said Law, who expressed hope for a revival of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> efforts to end the factional strife and provide `` greater integrity of territory for the Lebanese.'' Law said that in the past, Christians and Moslems `` have been able to forge out a very unique kind of political experiment ... -LRB- and -RRB- live together in a political system that really was a model'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Law noted that large numbers of Christians are fleeing <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> because of the shelling there and said, `` if there is n't quickly some resolution to the Lebanese situation ... then one would despair of that Christian presence.'' Reporters asked the cardinal if he was optimistic about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s diplomatic efforts to end the hostage crisis `` I'm in the business of hope, I'm in the business of conversion, so I'm never ready to assume that the status quo is it,'' Law replied with a smile. Law said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had tentatively agreed to visit <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Sept. 23 to speak at a gathering of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> lawyers and judges. He said they also discussed events in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, a country Law has visited several times. Law said that despite recent arrests of human rights activists in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, he has seen progress in the communist island in the past five years toward wider freedom. `` It does seem to me that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, given its geographic location, very naturally ought to be in good relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said the cardinal.

 Espionage for communist countries accounted for nearly three-fourths of the 91 cases uncovered by Swiss authorities in 1980-88, a government report said Wednesday. The cases involved 141 spies, including 50 foreign diplomats. One hundred of the spies caught, or 71 percent, were from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc and other communist countries, the report by the Swiss Federal Prosecutor's Office said. However, it said the number of cases has fallen steadily after peaking at the start of the 1980s, when <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries resorted to economic espionage to counter a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ban on exports of high technology, imposed after the Soviet intervention of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The office provided no annual breakdown.

<TEXT>
 About 260 dependents of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government employees in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> who were evacuated in June have been authorized to return because of improved security conditions, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Department spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nonetheless is continuing to recommend to Americans that they defer non-essential travel to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She that the although the security situation has improved, it is still more unsettled than before the imposition of martial law in May. The dependents were ordered home three days after <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military forces routed demonstrators who had occupied <LOCATION> Tienanmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for weeks. As part of the disturbances, Chinese troops fired their weapons in the vicinity of a compound where diplomats and other foreign residents live. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>'s chief of security said bullets flew through a window into a room where his two children were watching television. The incident prompted a strong protest by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy to <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> was unable to say whether the issue was resolved to the satisfaction of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. At the time, officials said the shooting appeared to come from the indiscriminate firing of troops who were attempting to clear <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> civilians from the streets. The decision to send the dependents back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> contributed to the notion that U.S.-Chinese relations are gradually normalizing. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met late last month with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign minister during a visit to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Other officials, insisting on anonymity, said virtually all other foreign dependents who were evacuated in June have since returned to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. They also said that of the 350 American businessmen who departed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, about 150 have gone back. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> urged <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to take a number of precautions. It said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities have seized religious and political materials they deem objectionable and it urged that Americans refrain from going out after dark or photographing areas where disturbances have occurred.

<HEAD>Opposition Blasts Communists But Offers Cooperation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fledgling parliamentary opposition said Wednesday that said the Communists had destroyed Hungarian society in 42 years of rule, but it offered to cooperate with party reformers after free elections. Members of the opposition Hungarian Democratic Forum ruled out any coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> before general elections planned next year. But they said even a new government dominated by the forum and other opposition groups would likely include some Communist ministers. The forum counts among its members a tiny legislative caucus of three newly elected lawmakers. The country's one-chamber legislature has 370 members. `` We are trying to change a completely wrecked society to a new one,'' declared <PERSON> Istvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Csurka </PERSON>, a forum leader, speaking to reporters at his organization's headquarters in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. However, he did not present a program of change. Two of the front legislators complained of interference by local Communist officials during campaigning and voting in by-elections Saturday and on July 22. However, they suggested the irregularities were the work of overzealous individuals _ not part of a larger plan. While only a small fraction of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s electorate took part in the by-elections, opposition figures have viewed the results as an indication of Communist weakness during next year's general elections. Communist leaders, who endorsed a multiparty system in February, have sought to play down the defeat of their candidates, pointing to low turnouts and claiming their campaigns were low-key. <PERSON> Csurka </PERSON> was asked Wednesday if he or other top forum officials were ready to become prime minister if the opposition won next year's elections. `` We will find the right man from our ranks for any responsibility,'' he said. But he said `` there will be and there must be'' some Communists in the next Hungarian government, regardless of the election outcome. Forum spokesman <PERSON> Csaba </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiss </PERSON> put conditions on any post-election cooperation with the Communists. `` There can be no coalition if the key positions _ <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> _ are seized by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as in 1947,'' he told reporters. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> became a one-party state that year. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the opposition, led by the labor union Solidarity, has refused to join the ruling Communists in a coalition after Solidarity scored a sweeping victory in June elections.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The second and third liquor salesmen to take the stand at <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s tax evasion and extortion trial testified Wednesday that they, too, were forced to pay kickbacks on sales to Helmsley-owned hotels. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of Capital Liquors and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pursley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> both said they had to pay back 2 percent of their gross sales to four hotels _ the <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, the Palace, the New York <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moritz </LOCATION>. The salesmen testified that their commissions were generally 5 percent on gross sales. They testified the payments were arranged by Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>'s top aide, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>, and that the kickbacks were no longer required after <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> was fired in February 1986. The testimony was elicited by prosecutors to support the most serious charge Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> faces _ the allegation that she conspired with <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> to extort payoffs and goods from vendors doing business with Helmsley-owned companies. <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> is on trial with her. Last week, the first liquor salesman to testify, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, said he was forced to kick back the same percentage of his commission to keep his accounts at <LOCATION> Helmsley </LOCATION> hotels in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He said he gave about $ 10,000 in payoffs in 1984. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> testified that in addition he had to take on the task of acting as central purchasing agent for liquor for the hotels. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> decided to set up the arrangment after she was told certain employees within the company were taking kickbacks from liquor salesmen. <PERSON> Pursley </PERSON> said he took over the task after <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> left at the end of 1984. He testified that at a meeting in February 1985 with other liquor salesmen, <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> discussed where payments were going. `` He told us all that none of the money was going to him. It goes to Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Pursley </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> said he put the money in a special slush fund for Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON>. He quoted <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> as saying that Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> said that `` since we were so free with our money, she was going to take it.'' <PERSON> Pursley </PERSON> said he paid an average of $ 600 a month for one year beginning in February 1985. He delivered his cash payments in envelopes to <PERSON> Turco </PERSON>'s office, he said. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> testified that he kicked back about $ 9,000 over two years. He said that one of the <ORGANIZATION> Helmsleys </ORGANIZATION>' real estate companies would send him an invoice for consulting fees and that he would send a check for that amount. Mrs. <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> also is charged with tax evasion for allegedly disguising about $ 4 million in personal expenses as business expenses. <PERSON> Turco </PERSON> and another former aide, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licari </PERSON>, are charged with assisting in that scheme. All three are on trial on the tax charge. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum prison term of 20 years upon conviction. Penalties on the tax fraud charges range from three to five years.

 Analysts said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> may make a limited military response to Wednesday's suicide bombing by the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, despite the risk to diplomatic efforts aimed at ending the hostage crisis. The government did not mention retaliation in its response to statements from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> saying the suicide car bomb, which wounded five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and an allied militiaman, was a response to the abduction July 28 of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> spiritual leader. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> telephoned President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a way of `` achieving a better coordination between the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> positions on hostages and prisoners of war,'' said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s adviser, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> He described the 10-minute conversation as `` very good and friendly.'' He said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> repeated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position that it will free <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> only in exchange for the three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and `` all the hostages.'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> would not give details of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s replies. Sixteen Western hostages are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. An Israeli government statment after the bombing said: `` To our great sorrow, another brutal attack was committed today close to our northern border. This attack, for which <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> assumed responsibility, is another link in a long and bloody chain of attacks along this border which has been going on for many years. `` This is another horrible reminder of the constant security problem along our northern border which unfortunately places <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the frontline of the struggle against international terrorism.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s coordinator for south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Uri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubrani </PERSON>, said there would be retaliation eventually, but he did not say when or what form it would take. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> as it deals with all the organizations which threaten the normal life of the security zone,'' he said. `` Violence has two edges and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will retaliate in one way or another ... in due time, in a place it will choose.'' <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merari </PERSON>, a terrorism expert at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be viewed as weak unless it retaliated. `` An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> retaliation would disrupt negotiations no more than this car bombing. Unless this becomes a trend, a single Israeli retaliation would not change anything,'' he said. He suggested the military response should be measured so as not to provoke a cycle of attack and counterattack. `` I would recommend some type of strike or force in retaliation for this,'' he said. `` The only way to bring <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> to a -LRB- hostage -RRB- deal is to project force against force.'' Speaking on Israeli TV, military commentator <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Ishai </PERSON> said in the past <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had used air raids to respond to such attacks even when Israeli prisoners were threatened. `` When we had a car bomb attack last year, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> threatened that if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> reacted, it would harm Israeli prisoners of war. The army then made its calculations and the air force bombed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> command headquarters,'' he said. The suicide car bomb in October 1988 claimed the lives of eight <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and wounded seven others. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> responded with three air raids and a ground assault in which 16 Lebanese were killed and 40 wounded. <PERSON> Ben-Ishai </PERSON> also said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> risked being viewed as weak if it did not retaliate. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Levran </PERSON>, a retired brigadier general and a commentator on military affairs, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> response would be `` moderate'' if a military option was chosen to punish <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>. But he suggested <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> might refrain from any military activity so as `` not to agitate world public opinion'' after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticism over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s abduction of <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>. `` I would not be surprised if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will swallow hard and do nothing. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does not want to disrupt the process -LRB- of negotiations -RRB- which has begun with <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>,'' he said in an interview. `` If <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is going to punish <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> by launching reprisals it will be shooting itself in the foot. It will not facilitate the exchange of prisoners,'' he added. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> abducted the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> clergyman to try to prod <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> into agreeing to a prisoner exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> radicals aligned with the group are believed to be holding three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> servicemen captured in 1986. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> has offered to exchange <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> and several hundred other Shiite prisoners held in <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> jails for the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> airman and two soldiers. But <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> stressed Tuesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not start negotiations until they had some sign of life from the POWs.

<TEXT>
 If E.T. took a little ocean vacation with <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Verne </PERSON>, and dropped in for lunch with <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridges </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Flipper </PERSON>, maybe someone would make a movie out of it. Maybe it could even be called `` The Abyss.'' The $ 43 million 20th Century <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> summer spectacular is about as derivative as any movie can get. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, who wrote and directed, pulls a litany of movie formulas and gimmicks, including a few from `` Aliens,'' which he also wrote and directed. What redeems `` The Abyss'' from being an `` E.T.'' or `` Aliens'' rip-off are some spectacular special effects and camera work. <PERSON> Deepcore </PERSON>, a submersible oil rig, is working not far from where a submarine, armed with nuclear warheads, has crashed in a fantastically deep trough. The government commandeers the mother vessel, orders <PERSON> Deepcore </PERSON> to take on a group of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> SEALS and work with the divers to salvage the sub. At the same time, a hurricane rages above and an alien nation broods below. It seems the hurricane was a little something the aliens whipped up to protest nuclear weapons. The aliens, who move faster than a speeding bullet and who are definitely more powerful than any locomotive, also are responsible for the sub crash. Still, they are friendly, peace-loving little shards of light, vaguely reminiscent of the ethereal creatures in <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>'s `` Cocoon. <PERSON> Deepcore </PERSON>'s crew is a lovable bunch of hardcore riggers led by <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigman </PERSON> -LRB- Ed <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> -RRB-. His estranged wife, <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastrantonio </PERSON> -RRB-, designed the rig and brings down the SEALS for the salvage operation. The SEALS have a definite attitude problem, and their leader, Lt. <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Biehn </PERSON> -RRB-, is certifiable. The hurricane causes an above-water crane to crash down on <LOCATION> Deepcore </LOCATION>, and drags it the brink of the underwater trough. After communciation is severed with the mother ship, <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> goes solo and decides to arm one of the sub's nuclear warheads, terminate the aliens and kill <PERSON> Deepcore </PERSON>'s crew. Before his ultimate demise, <PERSON> Coffey </PERSON> manages to arm one of <PERSON> Deepcore </PERSON>'s mini sea <ORGANIZATION> Rovers </ORGANIZATION>, called Little Geek, with a nuclear warhead, aimed straight into the trough at the alien nation. The first two-thirds of `` The Abyss'' amount to a fairly good adventure-thriller, with lots of sparkling, hip dialogue, good character development and nonstop action. The last third is a joke. <PERSON> Brigman </PERSON> decides to don a dive suit and go into the trough to follow Little Geek. He uses a special, experimental <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> liquid mix as his breathing aparatus. Why does he go? Because it's a dirty little job and `` somebody has to do it,'' he says with a straight face. This and other cliches pop up with astonishing frequency as `` The Abyss'' begins its plunge into movie camp. There are odd moments: <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> drowning in freezing water and then being revived by <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> slapping her face and calling her names after adrenalin and shocks have failed; a syrupy and trite <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> confessing to all sorts of mistreatment to <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> as he almost loses conciousness at depths no human has ever gone. There are pure ripoffs: an alien finger resembling little E.T.'s spindly appendage reaching out and touching a human _ much the same way as in `` E.T. The Extraterrestrial,'' and <PERSON> Michaelangelo </PERSON>'s ceiling in the Sistine Chapel But <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mastrantonio </PERSON> are a good blend, and the Deepcore crew is an interesting lot, thanks in part to <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Feuer </PERSON>'s casting Still, it's a formula group: a strong woman who helps leads the crew from disaster; a black; a burly, football type; a comic who travels with his pet mouse; a laidback guy named <PERSON> Jammer </PERSON> who comes through when the going gets real rough. <PERSON> Mikael </PERSON> <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>'s photography is superb, and the original music by <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON> has just the right taste of suspense and promise. But in the end, `` The Abyss'' promises so much and delivers so little. Produced by <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, `` The Abyss'' is rated PG-13 for language and thrills.

<HEAD>Government Admits Controversial Groups to Its Charity Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Wednesday listed 389 charities, including several controversial ones, that will take part in a massive employee solicitation drive that raises about $ 160 million a year from federal workers. A homosexual group, the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund, is among 19 groups whose applications were included in the Combined Federal Campaign after initially being turned down. `` I assume, frankly, that there was simply a desire to keep Lambda out of the circle by virtue of its mission,'' defending homosexuals and homosexual rights in court, said executive director <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>. `` Frankly, it is a thrilling prospect for us,'' he said. `` Being listed helps fulfill our mission.'' He said his was the first overtly homosexual group to win the right to participate. He said he could not anticipate how much money would come to the group since designating it as a charitable recipience `` may be viewed by the employee as one degree of coming out.'' The fund, with a $ 1 million budget, was established in 1972. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Personnel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, said that after personally reviewing rejected applications, she approved 19 rejected organizations, gave qualified approval to eight, left six pending and denied approval to 55, of which 33 had not complied with requests for additional information. Those given qualified approval for one year spend more than 25 percent of their receipts on administrative and fund-raising costs, normally grounds for exclusion. Approval went to a range of causes, some potentially controversial. Among them are the <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Appeal </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executives </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Living </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Operation </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Anti-abortion groups, such as the National Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, and abortion rights groups, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> and Planned Parenthood-World Population, already were listed. So were such conservative groups as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and such liberal outfits as People for the American Way. Being listed can bring large amounts of money to an organization at virtually no cost _ or it can bring nothing if employees do not specifically designate the charity. The fund drive raises over $ 160 million from 4 million federal employees, including military people and postal workers, with the average giving $ 60.68. It is the largest employee solicitation in the country, <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> said, although Americans individually gave $ 87 billion to churches and charities in 1988, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund-Raising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Counsel </ORGANIZATION>. Federal employees may designate up to five charities from a list that, when local groups are included, in some instances numbers as many as 1,000. About 80 percent of the gifts are designated. Of the rest, about 82 percent goes to the local <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> campaign, 7 percent to a group of 33 international service agencies, 7 percent to national health agencies and 4 percent to local groups, according to OPM. Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> issued an executive order in 1983 restricting the federal drive to traditional health and welfare charities. But after protests and lawsuits by advocacy groups, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 enacted legislation broadening the grounds for admission but giving the <ORGANIZATION> OPM </ORGANIZATION> director discretion.

 T.C. `` Son'' Lansford, bass player for the Western swing group <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playboys </ORGANIZATION>, has died. He was 75. <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON>, who died Monday in a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> hospital, was one of the first musicians to use an electric bass guitar. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, one of the original members of the 1930s <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playboys </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON>'s death leaves <PERSON> Smokey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dacus </PERSON>, <PERSON> June </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamblin </PERSON> and himself as the only surviving original members. `` He was the first slap bass player I had ever seen and he could slap the devil out of that thing,'' <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said. `` We were chop bass players. We did n't have much finesse, we just tried to keep the rhythm the way <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> wanted it.' Lansford's sons told the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> that he picked up a fiddle when he was 10 years old and played a tune. <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>, his cousin, after the older musician had left the Light Crust Doughboys and gone to <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> in 1934 and formed his <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Playboys </ORGANIZATION>. To join the band, <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON> had to hop a freight train to get to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, then rode with <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>' parents to <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>. Lansford gave up the fiddle and began playing bass because <PERSON> Wills </PERSON> already handled the fiddling. Within two years of making the switch, he was voted by Variety magazine as one of the top two bass players in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. After marrying in 1936, <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON> left the Playboys and formed a band in <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION> called The Flying Dutchmen. But after a couple years, the band broke up and <PERSON> Lansford </PERSON> rejoined the Playboys. Lansford appeared in three movies with the Playboys. He also was a part-time barnstorming pilot and stunt flier. During World War II, he trained <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilots and some <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pilots in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> after unsuccessfully trying to join the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. Lansford had lived in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> since about 1951, the Star-Telegram said. He occasionally performed, but less frequently in recent years because of arthritis in his hands. He is survived by two daughters, one son, 10 grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren. Services will be Saturday in <LOCATION> Colleyville </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Lesbian Soldier Can't Re-Enlist in Army, Appeals Court Rules</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has barred an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> sergeant from re-enlisting because she is a lesbian, saying sexual orientation is important for maintaining discipline and the integrity of command. The 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reversed a lower court decision allowing <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>, to rejoin the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The Army had refused to allow her to re-enlist because of her professed homosexuality. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Berigan </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON>'s attorney, said she will appeal. `` It's our intent to keep up with the appeals and go as far as we can,'' he said from his home in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. Tuesday's ruling reversed a January decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON>'s First Amendment rights to freedom of speech were violated by an Army regulation barring homosexuals. Ruling on the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal, the three-judge appeals court panel found that while Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON>'s declaration of homosexuality is speech, it is also an acknowledgement of identification in a group. `` It is the identity that makes her ineligible for military service, not the speaking of it aloud,'' Judge <PERSON> Harlington </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> wrote in the decision. `` Thus, if the Army's regulation affects speech, it does so only incidentally, in the course of pursuing other legitimate goals.'' The appellate court agreed with the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that it needs to distinguish military personnel on the basis of sexual orientation to maintain discipline and preserve the integrity of rank and command. The court also found that Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON>'s 5th Amendment right to equal protection under the law had not been violated. Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON> was traveling in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and could not be reached for comment, said a friend, <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentle </PERSON>, contacted at Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyle </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorney who argued the case before the appellate court for the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment. Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON>, 40, was discharged from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 after she said she was a lesbian. After a series of court actions, she was reinstated in September 1987. Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON> applied to re-enlist for a six-year <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> term last August. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> ordered the Army to consider her re-enlistment without regard to her homosexuality. The Army refused to let her rejoin, but after <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> found the service in contempt of court in January, Ms. <PERSON> Ben-Shalom </PERSON> was allowed to re-enlist. The action was, however, made conditional on the outcome of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal to the circuit court.

<TEXT>
 A group that monitors children's television asked the government Wednesday to regulate paid telephone message services pitched to young viewers and said calls to such numbers can bring parents unexpectedly large telephone bills. Calling it a pocketbook issue rather than a free speech one, Action for Children's Television requested the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to restrict such 900-number services. Its petition asks the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to require <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to issue refunds on demand to parents for unauthorized calls made by their children, make a blocking device available to parents and itemize telephone bills `` for child services.'' The group's targets are the numbers advertised on children's programs shown on independent stations during weekday afternoon hours, when many `` latchkey'' children are at home but their parents are at work The 900 numbers invite children to talk to popular personalities and cartoon characters, such as the Tooth Fairy, Mighty Mouse or She-Ra and He-man, and often offer products such as posters, signs or shirts as enticements to call, according to the ACT petition. Although children are told they will `` talk to'' a character, they hear a recorded message instead, the petition says. In fact, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> says that any 900 service for which it consents to do the billing must be a recorded message. It must also say what the call will cost, tell children to ask for their parents' permission and allow no `` funny technology,'' such as the service that told children to hold the phone to the TV while it bleeped out tones A typical call to such a 900 number might cost $ 2.45 _ $ 2 for the first minute and 45 cents for each additional minute. <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s product marketing manager for 900 services, said the company does n't issue all 900 numbers although `` we have some sponsors that do provide programming with licensed characters.'' Licensed characters are those for whom the rights are owned by a company. West said customers can contest their bills although <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T has no blanket policy on granting refunds. She said regional phone company have the choice of offering itemized billing and in some instances do offer blocking devices. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> says it set its guidelines `` in concert with'' the regulatory guidelines of the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Council of Better Business Bureaus. The ACT petition calls the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T safeguards ineffective. ACT President <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Charren </PERSON> said that although <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T may not issue all the numbers, `` the ones they bill are the ones we are talking about.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> unit that oversees children's advertising says it does not `` encourage or endorse this form of advertising to children'' but is proposing guidelines <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorsch </PERSON>, president and founder of <ORGANIZATION> Teleline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beveraly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, one of the leading providers of such services, said research shows that an average call lasts less than two minutes, that children have asked their parents' permission and that children who do n't understand that the costs mount with the time they are on the phone probably could n't make a call in the first place. He said his company has worked closely with ACT and the business bureau to put out responsible programming.

 A group of children used a playground as headquarters for a make-believe drug ring, selling neatly packaged bags of sugar and grass clippings that looked like cocaine and marijuana, police said Wednesday. `` I think the whole thing is very tragic. Normally they play fireman or policeman. It's tragic when they want to grow up and be drug dealers,'' said city Councilman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Zug </PERSON>. Authorities speculated that the children _ who were believed to be 12 or younger _ were either emulating their parents or being trained for the drug business. `` I was shocked and depressed,'' said Detective <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Capello </PERSON>, looking through a tackle box stacked with bogus drugs and colored slips of paper detailing the group's transactions. `` I think they were doing this as a game with other kids, but it was a very serious game,'' <PERSON> Capello </PERSON> said. The tackle box was turned over to police last week after two children, ages 7 and 9, found it in a tree at the dilapidated downtown playground, which neighbors said had been closed for at least two years. The playground in the city east of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION> borders an area of the city known for drug use, officials said. Police had not interviewed any children in the case but said they had five names from reading ledger notes in the box and intended to speak with the youngsters Thursday. `` It was sophisticated packaging; they were maintaining a list of buyers, money spent and money owed. ... I was totally shocked,'' said Chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLeo </PERSON>. `` What concerns me is the age category we're dealing with. We must do something to save the next generation,'' he said. Also in the tackle box was 52 cents and detailed lists of product prices and sizes. On one slip, cocaine was misspelled `` cocain.'' A small bag of the bogus cocaine was priced at 55 cents. The small bags of grass clippings were priced at $ 1. Officials said the grass clipping and sugar were not illegal, but selling them under the pretense of being drugs would be. They said their primary concern was that the children receive counseling. `` There absolutely needs to be discussions with them to teach them about drugs and the tragedy that can come from drugs,'' <LOCATION> Zug </LOCATION> said.

<HEAD>Police Fire Tear Gas at Campus Protesters, Detain Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police fired tear gas at hundreds of black protesters marching from a university campus in defiance of emergency regulations Wednesday. Fifteen journalists were detained. At least 1,500 black students and other activists held a lunchtime rally at the mixed-race <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cape </ORGANIZATION> as part of a national campaign of defiance against emergency restrictions and apartheid laws. The protests, which have been marked by almost daily student-police clashes in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area, coincide with the campaign for Sept. 6 parliamentary elections. The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> excludes representatives of the black majority of 28 million. After the rally, police detained 15 reporters, photographers and cameramen for foreign and local news organizations for about four hours. They were placed in police vehicles and held outside the campus while police fired rounds of tear gas at the between 500 and 600 people who marched off the university grounds after the rally. The journalists were later taken to a police station and warned that they were under investigation for allegedly violating the 3-year-old emergency regulations that restrict press coverage of unrest. Enforcement of the press restrictions has not been comprehensive. `` About 20 policemen were firing tear gas at random as the marchers with placards came about a quarter of the way across the road, then moved back,'' said a journalist who watched the events. `` The police were firing tear gas over the cars passing on the road, then they went onto the campus and fired tear gas all over.'' It was not known whether any students were arrested or injured in the clash. The Argus, a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> newspaper, said in an editorial Wednesday that the defiance protests, which began a week ago with black patients seeking treatment at white hospitals, were gathering momentum. The paper said organizations and individuals restricted under the 1986 emergency were refusing to `` meekly acquiesce in their own repression.'' `` The government's response has been predictable,'' said The Argus. `` It has furiously denounced the organizations leading the defiance and ordered a tough police response _ no doubt sensing that such handling of the situation could boost its flagging fortunes in the general election campaign.'' The 924,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions is a leader of the defiance campaign, despite a government decree that bans the organization from engaging in political activity. The congress issued a statement Wednesday mocking Law and Order Minister <PERSON> Adriaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlok </PERSON>'s comment that he will investigate the labor federation's breaking of the emergency restrictions. `` What he will find is that the vast majority of right-thinking <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> have stopped observing the state of emergency long ago,'' the statement said. `` Not only are these regulations incomprehensible and unenforceable, but people do not regard themselves as bound by laws which they had no say in passing.''

 A man arrested after a bank robbery said he committed a string of heists around the country while trailing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because `` voices'' told him to kill the president, police said Wednesday. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON>, a 34-year-old transient, reportedly told investigators he robbed the bank because he needed money to carry out his assassination plan. `` He was going to get about $ 3,000 to buy a motorcycle and go east and assassinate the president or kill some children,'' said <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>. `` I believe with all my heart from talking to him, he would have done just that.'' <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> police that <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> fits the profile of someone capable of carrying out such an act. `` We had no idea what we had on our hands when we picked him up,'' said <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON>. `` As he started talking, we realized we had a very scary individual in our presence.'' During an interview with police and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> appeared `` very calm, relaxed and with very good recall.'' While an investigation continued to determine whether the alleged assassination plan may result in criminal charges, <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> remained jailed without bail in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> on one count of bank robbery. <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, the federal public defender appointed to represent <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON>, declined comment about his client. He said information about the <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> case and background will likely be revealed at a detention hearing scheduled in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. After he was arrested Friday for allegedly robbing Gateway Savings in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> `` readily admitted to the robbery of this bank and seven others across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON>. `` He also admitted he had been stalking or pursuing the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in an attempt to kill him.'' His assassination plan was attributed to voices that `` were telling him to do certain things, and if he did not do so, he would be poisoned,'' <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> said. `` These voices did not tell him why.'' <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> indicated his presidential death plan focused on `` the office, not the man ... he wants to assassinate the president.'' <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> also `` made some mention he had seen the TV news reports about the school children shootings in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, and at that point he heard very loud voices that said if he could n't kill the president, he should go after school children.'' On Jan. 17, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> opened fire with a semiautomatic AK-47 on a <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION> schoolyard, killing five children and wounding 29 students and a teacher. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henneman </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roudebush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> was admitted on Jan. 14, 1987, for a 30-day stay and again in April 1987 for 45 days. <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> was admitted on Feb. 10, but walked away from the hospital on March 20, he said. <PERSON> Henneman </PERSON> said he could not reveal what <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> was treated for, but said he is an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> veteran from <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> told him he had been treated at VA hospitals for mental problems, and that he had been interviewed by <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> authorities for alleged threats against ex-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. State and federal checks failed to show any criminal record for <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON>, he said. <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> said that `` on one occasion in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, he was somewhat close -LRB- to harming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB-, but because of security precautions, he was unable to carry out the threat,'' <PERSON> Maddux </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Huse </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> claimed he had been in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> the night before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s April 17 speech to a crowd of 4,000. <PERSON> Daughette </PERSON> apparently diagramed the area where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke, <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> said. `` He told agents he had picked out the perfect spot to shoot from but could n't reach it on speech day because of metal detectors,'' <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> said. `` He then ran to several areas trying to get close enough for a shot but before he could shoot, the president finished and left the podium.''

<HEAD>Firm Affiliated With Lucas Defends Apartments in Racial Discrimination
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> firm with which failed civil rights chief nominee <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is affiliated is defending an apartment building against racial discrimination suits, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The most recent lawsuit, filed Wednesday by the department's civil rights division, charged that <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> had engaged in a pattern of intentional racial discrimination against blacks <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, whom President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had nominated to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, has not been involved and will not participate in the law firm's handling of the case, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>. River House has been represented by <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Luptak </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> firm where <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> is listed as `` of counsel'' on a financial disclosure form he filed earlier this year. River House has already been the subject of a discrimination suit brought by private plaintiffs, said <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON>. The federal suit charges that the cooperative `` has engaged in a policy and practice of discrimination'' against blacks in violation of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the fair-housing provisions of the 1968 Civil Rights Act. In a statement, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markman </PERSON> said, `` It's long past time that such discrimination in housing is acceptable in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, 61, a former sheriff and chief executive of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights division was defeated last week by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Opponents charged that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> lacked professional qualifications to head the 150-lawyer division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. They also questioned his commitment to enforcing civil rights laws. Supporters said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>, who is black, was a victim of racism or was being penalized for his refusal to criticize recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that they say weaken affirmative action. The White House says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is still considering giving <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> a so-called recess appointment to the position, which would enable <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to serve without <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation through 1990. But such a move could anger Senators and create political difficulties for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had compiled a list of possible alternative candidates for the civil rights post. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> will be given a job within the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, possibly at the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. He ruled out the possibility that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> would be appointed to head the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, a position <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> had reportedly sought before the civil rights nomination.

 <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> asked for help in the search for a plane carrying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> and 13 companions and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> responded by sending a fleet of rescue aircraft Wednesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the disappearance a matter `` of great concern to us'' and said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> is `` going to get all the cooperation we can give them'' in the search, now in its third day. Sundown ended another day of the air and ground search with no trace of the <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Havilland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Otter </ORGANIZATION> plane, but <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge d'affairs in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, said, `` There are a lot of aspects that give us cause for hope.'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said the plane was a `` great bush aircraft'' capable of landing in close, rough terrain, and that the pilot, <PERSON> Assefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebre-Giorgis </PERSON>, was `` the best damn <PERSON> bush </PERSON> pilot in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Gebre-Giorgis </PERSON>, a former Ethiopian air force pilot, `` knows <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> like the back of his hand,'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, 44, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat who heads the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hunger </ORGANIZATION>, has taken a great interest in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s refugee problem and was flying to the Fugnido refugee camp near the border with <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, 480 miles southwest of the capital of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>. The congressman from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> arrived on Monday and hours later boarded the Twin Otter _ a high-winged, short takeoff and landing aircraft powered by two turboprop engines. With him were eight other Americans and five Ethiopians, including the pilot and co-pilot. The plane took off in bad weather for the camp. <PERSON> Gebre-Giorgis </PERSON> made his last radio contact 15 minutes out of <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> and the plane never arrived. Officials said nine or 10 Ethiopian search planes were in the air at any one time Wednesday, crisscrossing an area of about 24,000 square miles. Police, security officials and farmers have conducted ground searches. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters in the Oval Office that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> was `` trying to find what assets are available'' for the rescue effort. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adviser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scowcroft </ORGANIZATION> reported that `` the Ethiopians have asked for our help ... Well, they're getting it.. They're going to get all the cooperation we can give them.'' <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said that Marxist <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> `` agreed to an overflight of the area by a U-2 photo-reconnaissance plane. A C-21 aircraft will be sent to provide support for that overflight.'' She said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-141 Starlifter medical evacuation plane was sent from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s authority carrying a 20-member medical team and search and rescue, weather and communications personnel. `` Defense is sending a number of aircraft ... Two HC-130 aircraft will be deployed from ... -LRB- <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> -RRB- later today. ... -LRB- The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- is considering sending a C-5 cargo plane carrying five UH-60 helicopters.'' <PERSON> Houdek </PERSON> said one cause for hope was `` that we have n't found any wreckage'' in the rugged mountains and high plateaus along the intended flight path. The search area was expanded Wednesday to parts of <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> south of the Fugnido camp. `` They're putting more resources into the area around <PERSON> Mizan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tefer </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Guraferda </LOCATION>, southeast of Fugnido,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> political and economics officer. <LOCATION> Guraferda </LOCATION> is near an area where people reported hearing a light plane circling a dirt landing strip Monday, <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> said, and `` we have to reiterate that these areas are so isolated they could have put down anyplace.'' He described the region as `` without any communication, virtually no roads and sparsely populated.'' The plane carried an emergency first aid kit, he said, and `` we just have to keep hoping they're OK.'' <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON> conceded that the Twin Otter could have hit one of the many mountains along its path, some of which reach heights of more than 12,000 feet Also on the plane were three congressional staff members; a friend; four Americans, including one man's wife, from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, and five Ethiopians: three government officials, the pilot and co-pilot. <PERSON> Fugnido </PERSON>, one of four refugee camps in southwestern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> run by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, houses more than 300,000 Sudanese who have fled famine and civil war.

 A chemical company's chief executive entered a guilty plea for his company Wednesday before a federal judge who demanded to see the `` top man'' before allowing it to plead guilty to polluting a waterway. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> told <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive and chairman, that he wanted to send a message that companies and the people who run them must be accountable when they damage the environment. When natural resources `` are gone, they are gone,'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said. `` I'm one of those judges who wants to get someone's attention, from someone who can do something about it. That's why you're here. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON>, who calmly and politely answered <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s questions, apologized for the accident and said his company has spent millions of dollars to improve environmental protection and safety at its <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> plant since the January 1985 spill. He said he was confident the accident would not be repeated. <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, a Philadelphia-based chemical company, is merging with the French petrochemical company <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquitaine </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> said while there was no way the court could monitor <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Elf </ORGANIZATION>'s future performance, he believed <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> was sincere in promising the company would do better. `` I assure you it will,'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> replied. Environmentalists and legal experts have said that by requiring <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> to appear in person, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> could set a precedent for punishing corporate negligence. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, prosecutor in the case, said he thought <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>'s actions would serve as a strong deterrent `` I'm sure Mr. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> is not experienced in standing up before a federal judge,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. `` For him to have to come here and answer the judge's questions, I'm sure it got his attention.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> was charged after a tank spilled at least 75,000 gallons of bleach into <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>'s Hylebos Waterway, which empties into Puget Sound. The bleach, sodium dichromate, contained hexavalent chromium, which can cause cancer when inhaled in a dry form. In court Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said `` there was a negligent failure to test the tank for structural integrity.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> has since moved its caustic chemical tanks away from the waterway and surrounded them with a dike. In May, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> agreed to plead guilty to five misdemeanor counts after criminal charges against four company officials, including three executives, were dropped. <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> was not charged. The company also agreed to pay a $ 500,000 fine and to create a $ 600,000 trust fund to pay for environmental improvements in the <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> area. The plea agreement covered two counts of negligently failing to maintain adequate storage tanks, two of discharging pollutants and one of failing to promptly report the spill to the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. Twice, however, <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> refused to accept guilty pleas from attorneys and lower ranking executives of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION>, demanding instead that the `` top man'' appear before him. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> has said the case is among the first in which the government based its prosecution on corporate negligence rather than deliberate wrongdoing. It may also be the first instance in which a corporate executive has been ordered to plead the guilt of the corporation, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skover </PERSON>, professor of civil procedure and constitutional law at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Puget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. After the hearing, <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> declined to speculate on whether leaders of other companies might find themselves in a similar situation. `` The decision to come out here was not dictated by legal considerations,'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said. `` We just thought that this was the best way to bring this situation in <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> to a satisfactory conclusion. How other companies or other CEOs are going to react I really have no way of knowing.'' <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> repeatedly asked <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> who would be accountable for the spill and for preventing a recurrence. `` I'm here to tell you that as chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> that I'm here to represent <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> and say that <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> is responsible,'' <PERSON> Tuttle </PERSON> said.

 Cupcake, the pony whose errant hoof disrupted service on the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rail </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, now has another tale of whoa. <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> officials are demanding a $ 2,625 payment for the buses it was forced to hire to get commuters to their destinations when the pony's hoof was stuck between train tracks in December, setting off a two-hour delay. Railroad officials said in a letter this week to Cupcake's owner that if she did not pay the expenses within 30 days they would take her to court. The iron horse can wait until the cows come home, said owner <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amagansett </LOCATION>. She's not paying. `` I think this is a very high and mighty way to handle what happened,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON> who owns two other ponies. `` This is outrageous.'' Cupcake, 19, escaped during the night from the barn in the Eggers' backyard. `` We had just built a new barn and apparently the latch was faulty,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>. Cupcake trotted over to the railroad tracks, a few miles away, where his hoof got stuck. The Eggers were called early in the morning and told their horse was stalling train traffic. `` When we got there Cupcake looked so sad,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>. `` His head was slumped down and he looked like he had just given up any chance of ever being free again.'' A veterinarian injected the horse with a sedative. Rescue workers then picked him up by his tail, lifting him uninjured from the railroad ties. `` What happened was not our fault, not Cupcake's fault,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Eggers </PERSON>. `` There is just no way we are going to pay for this.'' `` We think Cupcake is getting a bad rap,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> LIRR </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said he regrets what happened to Cupcake, but the owner should have kept him on her property. `` This is a unique case'' because there is a horse involved, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> said. He said the railroad often seeks payment from people who disrupt service, such as motorists who damage crossing gates by driving through them.

 A Mennonite who voluntarily confessed to fellow worshipers that he had molested several children was fatally shot by his 24-year-old son, state police said. The body of <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>, 47, was found in his living room Tuesday morning with a single wound to the head-neck area, police said. Hours later state police arrested <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> of Gap. The son was arraigned before District Justice <PERSON> Arden </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopp </PERSON> on a charge of homicide and jailed without bail. Police would not comment Wednesday on a motive or on any criminal investigation of the father. A mother of two children who allegedly were molested said a state trooper was investigating the reports last week. <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>'s employer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Glick </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Atglen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Engel </PERSON>'s youngest son, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON>, 12, telephoned him Tuesday morning. `` He said, ` Dad wo n't be at work today.' I asked him if his father was sick. Finally he told me that someone had shot his father. `` He said he had n't called an ambulance or the police. So I dialed the 911 number and asked for an ambulance,'' <PERSON> Glick </PERSON> said. In the arrest warrant affidavit, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> told state police that his brother, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, arrived at the home Tuesday morning, shotgun in hand. The 12-year-old told police that as he walked out of the living room _ leaving <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> alone _ the shooting occurred. A unidentified church leader was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Lancaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Era </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Wednesday as saying that about three weeks ago, <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> voluntarily confessed to sexually molesting several children. <PERSON> Engel </PERSON> was excommunicated, the church leader said, and taken later to a psychiatrist.

<TEXT>
 Forty-one members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday sent a letter asking President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to intervene in a long-running dispute over the fate of nine research monkeys. The `` Silver Spring monkeys,'' named after the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> suburb where the primates were confiscated by police from a research laboratory in 1981, currently are being held in a <LOCATION> Covington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, research center. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to direct the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to transfer the monkeys to a primate sanctuary. The department includes the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, which has custody of the monkeys. Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, who circulated the letter, said he and others in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have worked unsuccessfully for three years on a compromise with animal-rights groups and <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION>. Although animal-rights groups agreed to a proposal for most of the monkeys to be sent to a santuary, <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> refused, he said. <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> says three of the monkeys have deteriorated to the point that `` human considerations dictate euthanasia.'' The three were scheduled for euthanasia last December, <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> said, but a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> state court issued a restraining order stopping the action at the request of animal-rights groups. People Protecting Primates, a coalition of 80 organizations, applauded the letter, calling the monkeys `` political prisoners, symbolic of the debate over animal testing.'' <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> had no comment, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreiber </PERSON>.

 Officials at two airports assessed millions of dollars in damage Wednesday after a storm packing winds of 99 miles per hour scattered private aircraft like toys. Sixty-four planes were damaged _ 42 at <LOCATION> McCarran </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> here and 22 at <LOCATION> Sky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> _ when hurricane-force wind ripped through the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on Tuesday evening. Ten aircraft were heavily damaged or destroyed at McCarran; 13 were destroyed at <LOCATION> Sky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. No commercial aircraft were damaged although some commercial flights were barred from taking off or landing until the storm passed, McCarran spokeswoman <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said. Damage was `` well into the millions'' and could reach as high as $ 14 million, Ms. <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said. Damage also was estimated in the millions at <LOCATION> Sky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Two aircraft used by <ORGANIZATION> Scenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for Grand Canyon tours were blown into each other. The roof of the Scenic terminal, on the northern edge of the sprawling McCarran field, suffered heavy damage. A hangar belonging to Circus Circus Enterprises was nearly demolished, with one private jet left resting atop another. One airplane was blown some 200 feet at McCarran, airport spokesman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingalls </PERSON> said. A number of aircraft were flipped, and two corporate hangars were destroyed, he added. A large door on a hangar housing a $ 1 million <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> jet belonging to entertainer <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was blown away but the jet was undamaged. `` We have no idea where the door went,'' one of <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>'s pilots, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotton </PERSON>, said Wednesday. Damage at the airports was the only significant loss reported. There was some minor flooding and downed power lines, police spokesman <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> said. About 35,000 homes and businesses were without power for a period. Some residents were rattled by the fierce wind and rain. `` It was out of control. We could not see out of the windows of our agency,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, who was working at <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION>. `` The winds were blowing so hard. All of our phones and electricity was out for about three hours.'' <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> instruments recorded winds up to 90 miles per hour before lightning knocked out service at about 6 p.m.. That is the highest windspeed recorded in the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlott </PERSON> of the weather service's airport office <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Feick </PERSON>, supervisor of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s control tower at McCarran, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> equipment registered one gust at 99 mph. `` I've been here a few years and that's the highest windspeed I've ever seen,'' <PERSON> Feick </PERSON> said. `` It was pretty nasty, the tower was swaying quite a bit.''

<HEAD>Police Say Woman Tried to Inject Cocaine Before Giving Birth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A woman was discovered trying to inject herself with cocaine in a delivery room minutes before giving birth to a premature boy, police said. <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> <PERSON> Turenne </PERSON>, 31, was charged Wednesday in a warrant with one count of possession of cocaine, said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON>. <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> police could not say whether she had been arrested by Wednesday night. `` The woman needs help. We hope we can do something about it,'' Singer said, adding that <PERSON> Turenne </PERSON> has been referred to <ORGANIZATION> Ramsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> for evaluation. She had been taken by ambulance to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> while in labor Saturday morning, police spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adelmann </PERSON> said. A nurse noticed her inserting a hypodermic syringe into her wrist and stopped her before the drug was injected, he said. Five minutes later, she delivered a five-week premature boy. <PERSON> Turenne </PERSON>, who has three other children, was discharged from the hospital Monday. Doctors had ordered a search of the woman's suitcase and purse, which yielded three packets of cocaine, a bag of marijuana and drug paraphernalia, police said. The baby remained hospitalized, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobart </PERSON> said, but she declined to comment on the child's condition. Under a state law that took effect Aug. 1, doctors are required to report to county child protection officials evidence of use of illegal drugs by pregnant women or the presence of drugs in the systems of newborn babies. The law defines a positive drug test of a newborn as proof of child neglect. Doctors say pregnant women who use cocaine place themselves at a greater risk of miscarriage and premature birth and their babies are more susceptible to sudden infant death syndrome and erratic and violent behavior as toddlers.

<TEXT>
 Indian and Pakistani border troops traded fire last week in a dispute about a new road on <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s side, and intermittent skirmishes have occurred since, officials said Wednesday. A Pakistani <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said he could not confirm the report, but added: `` It's a common occurrence, the exchange of fire along this border.'' P.C. <PERSON> Dogra </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, said there were no casualties on the Indian side. He said the initial skirmish in the <LOCATION> Ramgarh </LOCATION> sector of <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state, along the northern border, began Friday when <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> soldiers fired on Indian troops building the road. Rice paddies spread into both countries along that stretch of border, which is dotted with bunkers of the two armies. `` Now, no one is allowed to go within 100 meters of the border, not even the farmers who plow their fields up to the last inch of the Indian land during normal times,'' <PERSON> Dogra </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> have fought three wars since the subcontinent became independent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1947. Two of the wars, in 1965 and 1971, were over border disputes in <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state that still are unresolved. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> claims part of the state and the disputed territory begins about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Ramgarh </LOCATION>, where the road is being built. Residents said about 100 families totaling more than 700 people had left the area since the shooting began. Dhoru Ram of <PERSON> Dagh </PERSON> village said he sent his family to <LOCATION> Jammu </LOCATION>, 20 miles to the north, after his hut came under fire Sunday and his water buffalo was killed. `` I will stay here as long as my fields are here,'' he said. A bus driver named <PERSON> Bitta </PERSON> said he had not seen `` such fright and panic among the people of the area'' since the 1971 war. <PERSON> Bitta </PERSON> said he had made several trips from <PERSON> Dagh </PERSON> and neighboring <LOCATION> Narayanpur </LOCATION> <LOCATION> village </LOCATION>, transporting `` panicky families'' to the interior. He said about 100 families had left. A state government spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said the people of all 25 villages in the sector would be moved to safer areas if a serious conflict with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> began. He said under the contingency plan, each family would be given 10,000 rupees -LRB- $ 606 -RRB-, and free food and accommodation in schools and government buildings elsewhere.

The flyer had been `` brought in for display by this private sightseeing company and unfortunately was one of those things that slipped through,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> MacBean </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. In a letter to <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdaugh </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, borough President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> protested against the flyer `` on behalf of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, the Botanical Garden, the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> and the more than 1.2 million residents of the borough of parks and universities.'' He also expressed fear that the flyer could deter potential investors from continuing their rehabilitation efforts in parts of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> where housing was abandoned or burned down in the late 1970s and early 1980s. `` Are n't you aware,'' <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON> wrote, `` that more than 16,000 new units of housing are being created here, most of them in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>? And that unfortunate characterization of the 41st Police Precinct as Fort Apache is a wornout cliche that no longer holds true.'' <PERSON> Murdaugh </PERSON> apologized for the flyer and said the <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> promotes `` the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> in all of our publications in extremely positive terms.''

The three, who were not identified, were being held by <LOCATION> Nye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities on federal trespass charges, according to <PERSON> Darwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said the three apparently hiked several miles across the desert to Mercury. Nineteen protesters were arrested on misdemeanor trespass charges when they crossed a cattle guard on a road leading to Mercury. They were cited and released, <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said. They were part of a group of 34 protesters who gathered at the test site entrance shortly after dawn Wednesday to commemorate the <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> bombing Aug. 9, 1945. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> said the demonstration was `` peaceful and calm.'' In <LOCATION> Moorestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, 15 anti-nuclear activists also marked the <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> anniversary by staging a peaceful demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s weapons facility. There were no arrests. The <LOCATION> Swarthmore </LOCATION>, Pa.-based <ORGANIZATION> Brandywine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> held a `` litany of remembrance'' service in front of the company's <ORGANIZATION> Aegis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> building, which is often the target of protests. In Mercury, 52 demonstrators were arrested at the site Sunday in a similar demonstration marking the anniversary of the atomic bombing of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Desert Experience, a Las Vegas-based anti-nuclear group, holds demonstrations annually marking the anniversary of the bombing of the two Japanese cities _ an action that brought World War II to an end.

<HEAD>Greek Parliament To Probe Procurement of Military Planes, Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Parliament on Wednesday began action to investigate purported kickbacks during the Socialist administration of former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> in procuring 80 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and French jet fighter planes. It approved formation of a 12-member fact-finding commission to determine whether enough evidence exists to justify a full investigation by a parliamentary committee. The probe involves 40 F-16s and 40 French-made Mirage 2000s and 300 Magic II missiles. Conservatives proposed the investigation following allegations that Greek taxpayers paid many millions of dollars more than they should have. When <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> decided to buy the French and American built aircraft after first coming to power in 1981, negotiations began between the governments. The F-16s were to be bought through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military credits, and a letter of intent was signed in 1984. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> receives $ 500 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military credits a year. Negotiations broke down and the socialist government came into direct contact with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>. It later signed a contract for the F-16s following what was billed as a `` political decision'' by <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>. The Mirage deal was signed earlier after <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> announced he made the decision following direct negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> Dassault-Breguet </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said direct agreement with the manufacturer eliminated middlemen and helped keep the total price lower. The government-to-manufacturer negotiations raised questions at the time since the aircraft's unit price was reportedly much higher than what the same firms quoted to other countries. The government said the aircraft contained additional sophisticated electronics that greatly boosted the unit cost. <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said Tuesday in parliamentary debate that his party considered the purchase the `` biggest scandal'' in the socialists' eight-year administration and <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s `` biggest political mistake.'' The 70-year-old <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> is recuperating from a kidney ailment and is also honeymooning with his 35-year-old bride. He was not present in Parliament to reply to the charges. He has not appeared during debates on scandals in which his former government was allegedly involved before losing June 18 general elections. Government spokesman <PERSON> Athanasios </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanelopoulos </PERSON> said last week it was unlikely the parliamentary commission would seek information from the aircraft manufacturers during the probe. In March 1985, a spokesman for <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s government said $ 2 billion would be spent on the 80 jets. In January 1987, the purchase price of the 40 F-16s was given by <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> as $ 940 million.

<HEAD>Moscow Urges Accord On Nuclear Testing This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Soviet arms control negotiator on Wednesday called on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to monitoring measures for underground nuclear weapons testing by the end of the year. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s chief envoy to the superpower nuclear testing talks, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is moving `` too slowly'' on the issue and urged <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to respond to a Soviet proposal. He called for the talks to be wrapped up this year. A six-week round of negotiations that ended Tuesday produced agreement on some `` important technical aspects'' for possible inclusion in a testing accord, <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> told a news conference. The talks are to set verification provisions and secure <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval for two 1970s unratified superpower nuclear accords. But negotiations stalled over the monitoring techniques for atomic weapons tests, <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> has said `` high-level decisions'' in the two capitals will be needed during the recess to move them along. No date was set for resuming the testing talks. The next phase of negotiations will focus on a nuclear test ban. <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> said he hoped Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Scecretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> would discuss the testing accord at their Sept. 19-20 meeting in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Soviet proposal would allow use of both remote seismic or on-the-spot monitoring for `` any explosion starting from a certain threshold.'' He did not specify the threshold <PERSON> Palenykh </PERSON> said. `` We favor the idea of combining various methods of verification. Of course it will be the right of each side to use the methods in its own combination,'' he said. He said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants to use only an on-site method in which blasts are measured by a cable placed down a hole near the explosion site. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says its method is the most accurate. The Soviets say remote monitoring of the shock waves is precise enough, simpler and less expensive. The talks are to establish verification provisions for the unratified 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty for nuclear weapons tests and the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty on non-military blasts. Both limit the power of explosions to 150 kilotons, the equivalent of 150,000 tons of TNT. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> rejected the original accords, arguing they could not be enforced. Most military analysts agree, however, that both sides have generally abided by the limits.

 Police stood guard Wednesday at an apartment building where an anti-drug crusader was killed, and her husband spent the day testifying against a man she had accused of selling cocaine. Fearful neighbors said they would remain quiet because of violent drug dealers. `` You open your mouth and try to help out and see what happens,'' says one man, sitting on a stoop down the street from where the <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> family lives. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, a 34-year-old mother of three, was getting ready to go to work about 4:30 a.m. Tuesday when at least five shots were fired through the closed bedroom windows of her first-floor apartment in the <LOCATION> Bushwick </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. One of the bullets hit her in the head and she died a few hours later at <ORGANIZATION> Wyckoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Her husband, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, 33, testified Wednesday before a grand jury against his neighbor, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who allegedly stabbed him in the arm and threatened him with an Uzi machine gun last month after Mrs. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> of selling cocaine in front of their home. Neighbors say the couple often chased drug dealers off their property. The shots were fired through heavy drapes, but Chief of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Detectives <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> X. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he believed the shots were not meant as a warning. `` If you shoot into a lit residence when people are inside, I have to assume it was meant to hurt someone,'' he said. Asked Tuesday if he planned to stop his anti-drug efforts, <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said, `` Never.'' A patrol car had been driving past the three-story house about once an hour since Saturday because the family had received death threats from drug dealers. Detectives went door-to-door Wednesday, but a police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, said, `` They have n't narrowed it down to any specific suspects.'' `` She's trying to protect her neighborhood, her kids,'' said <PERSON> Marguerite </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, who lives around the corner and knew the family because their children were good friends. `` That woman never hurt anybody.'' She said she was angered by the drug dealers that plague the neighborhood, but is afraid to complain to police. `` On my block I see what goes on but I shut up,'' she said. `` I'm afraid for my life and my kids.'' While women with baby carriages and children congregated in front of the <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>'s apartment, a block away a half-dozen or more drug dealers impassively continued their trade, selling heroin under brand names like `` Terror'' and `` Steel Ball.'' A police cruiser stopped at the intersection and two officers bolted out, hands on their holsters, and headed toward a group of men huddled together. The men ran in all directions and the police nabbed only one, who had a pocketful of cash but no drugs, and so was let go. Less than an hour later, the heroin hawkers were back. `` It's wheeling, dealing over here,'' the man sitting on his stoop said. He declined to give his name, saying he was afraid the dealers would come after him, even though he lives in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and was only visiting relatives. `` If I can notice it, what's their problem?'' he asked, referring to the police. The two officers assigned to guard the home said they realize what's going on around them, just out of sight, but said they do n't have the answers `` Drugs is a way of life around here,'' one said, speaking on condition that his name not be used. `` This is an every day thing.'' `` The drug problem's one thing, but the violence has gotten worse, even toward police officers,'' his partner said.

 Hundreds of demonstrators threw stones at police Wednesday during a protest demanding that Union Carbide get out of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Police responded with tear gas, and 25 people were injured and 500 arrested. The protest took place outside the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>. Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary operated the <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> pesticide plant, where a gas leak in 1984 killed more than 3,400 people. The Union Carbide plant in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> has not opened since the gas leak, but the protesters demanded that the <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based multinational shut down its remaining Indian operations. They include a <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> plant that makes batteries. Gas victims, opposition politicians and activists had designated today the start of `` <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>'' week. Exactly 47 years ago, on Aug. 9, 1942, <PERSON> Mohandas </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> launched <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s campaign for independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> with a `` Quit India Day.'' <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> observed a general strike today called by opposition parties and activists to press demands for more compensation for survivors of the gas leak, the world's deadliest industrial disaster. Public transportation operated, but shops and businesses were closed. About 200 police were deployed outside the Union Carbide research center to keep out protesters. When some demonstrators threw stones, police responded by firing tear gas shells and lashing out with their lathis, long bamboo batons tipped with steel. Several people in the crowd received bloody noses, and some appeared to have broken bones. Police vans rushed many of the injured to hospitals. At least five policemen were among the injured. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Jabbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Bhopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tragedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, lost consciousness as police beat him with their bamboo batons <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> had said earlier the protesters would try to take over the research center. `` We want Union Carbide to be prohibited from continuing its business in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and all industries owned by the killer multinational to be handed over to the workers,'' he said. The protesters denounced the $ 470 million settlement reached in February between Union Carbide and the government as compensation for the gas leak. Opponents say it is not enough.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A teen-ager was reported killed by a police plastic bullet during a night of riots in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, but family and friends claimed Wednesday there was no rioting in that area. The riots marked the anniversary of a British policy, since abandoned, of detaining terrorism suspects without trial. British news reports said <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, 15, died after being struck by a plastic bullet fired by security forces trying to control young supporters of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Royal Ulster Constabulary, the province's police force, said Wednesday plastic bullets had been fired in self-defense, to protect property and curb rioters. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>'s family and friends denied there was rioting in the <LOCATION> Dawson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> neighborhood where he was hit. Police said crowds in Roman Catholic areas of west <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> threw stones and gasoline bombs, lit bonfires and burned <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> flags. They reported more than 20 arrests. `` While it must be emphasized that the circumstances of <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>'s death have yet to be established, the <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> nevertheless regrets this loss of young life,'' said police statement issued Wednesday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> RUC </ORGANIZATION> emphasizes once again they have no desire whatsoever to use plastic baton rounds. If there is no rioting, there will be no plastic baton rounds.'' <PERSON> Damien </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a 15-year-old friend of the victim, said they were walking along a street and saw no rioting. `` I heard a shot, looked back and <PERSON> Seamus </PERSON> was on the ground,'' he said. <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, the dead boy's father, accused police of `` opening fire for no reason at all.'' <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> defended use of the plastic bullets and said, `` There is no grounds for suggesting their use last night was other than in accordance with the law.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> party in the province, said plastic bullets were inaccurate, lethal weapons. `` Plastic bullets are not used as a last resort; in most cases in these circumstances they are used as the first resort,'' <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s government expressed `` deep concern'' about the boy's death The British news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> quoted an official source as saying <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> would request a report on the matter. Government figures show police fired 54,234 plastic rounds from the time they replaced rubber bullets in 1975 through June 14. <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said 16 people, half of them under age 16, had been killed by plastic bullets before <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> died. <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, issued a statement blaming the death on provocation by security forces.

 <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, won the right Wednesday to be the host for the 1990 World Chess Championship final. Delegates to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>'s annual conference were to have voted on bids submitted by <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zealand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, announced he was withdrawing the bid. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> acted after being called to the conference stage for a private discussion with the president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Florencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Campomanes </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. He said <PERSON> Campomanes </PERSON> suggested he withdraw <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s bid. `` He was implying very strongly withdrawal with grace or be thrown out,'' <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> said in an interview. Earlier, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, a member of the federation's executive council, questioned a stipulation by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> that its bid was conditional on the participation of world champion <PERSON> Garri </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> The 26-year-old Soviet has said privately he might not defend his title in a match organized solely by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, known by its French acronym FIDE. On Tuesday, conference delegates voted to deny players any say in the choice of venue for the chess final and gave FIDE the power to replace a player who refused to accept match conditions. The rule changes grew out of a power struggle between FIDE, the game's governing body, and the <ORGANIZATION> Grandmasters </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the player's organization headed by <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>, who is its president. <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Houser </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wellington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> accused FIDE officials of `` political manipulation'' in choosing the venue of the chess final _ a 24-game match scheduled for 10 weeks starting Oct. 7, 1990. `` I am extremely disappointed in the manner the bids were handled by FIDE,'' she said. `` We arrived in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and the rules were changed.'' <PERSON> Anderton </PERSON> had also complained that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> bid was not accompanied by a banker's draft. Ms. <PERSON> Houser </PERSON> said, however, that the bid was underwritten by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Spassky </PERSON>, a former Soviet world champion who now plays for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and represented the <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> bid, said that while he was pleased <LOCATION> Lyon </LOCATION> would be the host, he did not think any venue should be forced on the players. The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Grandmasters </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bessel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kok </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, had urged delegates to show more respect for the wishes of grandmasters and head off a possible rift. Canadian delegate <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Divinsky </PERSON> said failure to solicit the players' opinions on match conditions was like organizing a large wedding without consulting the bride and groom. <ORGANIZATION> Lyon </ORGANIZATION> offered $ 1.83 million in prize money, plus a winner's trophy encrusted with diamonds and gold and valued at about $ 93,000 <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> also offered a prize fund of $ 1.83 million, plus about $ 370,000 for the chess federation's fund to promote the game in developing countries. A bitter feud flared between <PERSON> Campomanes </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1985 when <PERSON> Campomanes </PERSON> halted <PERSON> Kasparov </PERSON>'s first title duel with <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> without result, but leaving <PERSON> Karpov </PERSON> the champion.

<TEXT>
 Moslem fundamentalists threw firebombs at Christian-owned shops in a provincial town to avenge an affair between a Moslem woman and a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> man, police said Wednesday. A police officer said on condition of anonymity that `` many people'' were injured and 35 were arrested after an unspecified number of Moslem fundamentalists went on a rampage in northern Mahmoudeya late Monday. He said he expected 65 more would be detained. No weapons other than the firebombs were used, and police did not clash with the attackers, the officer said. The identities of neither the Moslem woman nor the Christian man were released. The daily state-run <ORGANIZATION> Al-Akhbar </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday Moslem extremists set fire to an appliances store in the Nile Delta town 85 miles north of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. The paper said many of the 35 arrested came from neighboring towns. The police officer said the incident occurred after a Moslem woman reported her affair with a Christian man to police. Friends decided to avenge the woman, who was unable to marry the Christian man. Egyptian law says a Moslem woman can only marry someone of her own faith, and the man was apparently unwilling to convert to Islam to marry her. Although the woman consented to the relationship, she was afraid of her family's reation, the officer said. She asked for protection, he said. In rural areas, there have been reports of fathers killing daughters who have had sexual liaisons before marriage. It was the second incident this year of an attack on Christians who engage in liaisons with Moslem women. The first occured May 1 in southern <LOCATION> Assiut </LOCATION> when seven Moslem fundamentalists broke into the home of a Christian student, killing him and wounding another <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> man and two Moslem women in the house.

 The captain of a Greek-flagged tanker that ran aground and spilled 300,000 gallons of heating oil off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in June pleaded innocent Wednesday to two state felony counts. <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>, 43, was released on $ 20,000 personal recognizance by Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldarone </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON>, spokesman for the attorney general's office. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> was indicted by a state grand jury last month on charges of polluting coastal waters and failing to have a harbor pilot aboard the World Prodigy when approaching <PERSON> Narragansett </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>. He has admitted he erred by failing to wait for a pilot before his tanker grounded on <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on June 23. In a related development, a hearing was set for next week in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> on federal misdemeanor charges against <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>. Attorneys for <LOCATION> Georgudis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> declined to comment on whether the hearing before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Judge <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> next Wednesday would involved a plea bargain Almond outlined last week. `` That's up to the judge as to what comes up,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the World Prodigy. On Friday, <PERSON> Almond </PERSON> said a plea bargain was being discussed that would involve one misdemeanor charge each against the captain and <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION>, which has not been charged with anything. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> attended a closed conference Wednesday with the judge. Neither he, Almond nor <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBiase </PERSON>, would say what the session was about. <PERSON> DiBiase </PERSON> also declined Wednesday to comment on the plea agreement. Georgudis is free on $ 50,000 bail on two federal pollution charges. As a condition of that bail he was required to surrender his passport and remain in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Almond would not identify the penalties that the government planned on recommending in the federal plea. Each of the charges carries a potential one-year jail term and fines totaling twice the cleanup costs. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> faces a maximum of $ 20,000 in fines and 13 months in jail if convicted of the state charges.

<TEXT>
 About 24,000 people on Wednesday mourned the victims of the world's largest atom bomb used against humans and called for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to strengthen its ban on nuclear warheads. In <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>'s Peace Park, the crowd commemorated the day 44 years ago when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped an atom bomb on this western coastal city. The world's first atomic attack had been carried out three days earlier in <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, killing 140,000 people. The bomb that hit <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, dubbed `` Fat Man,'' was more powerful. But because of the city's many hills, the damage was contained and 70,000 died, more than half the population. The city's call for stepped-up enforcement of a national policy banning nuclear warheads, including those on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships at Japanese ports, may command the attention of the government now that the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have been weakened by a series of scandals and unpopular policies. Under the 1951 U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledges to notify <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> if it plans to bring nuclear arms into the country. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never consulted with it, and so it believes such weapons have not entered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Critics charge the government uses the agreement to avoid the question of whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships dock in the country with nuclear weapons aboard. `` It is a government's duty to its citizens to strive to shed light upon the truth, not to wait passively for prior explanations,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Hitoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Motoshima </PERSON>, an independent. <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> said recently that if a Socialist government were formed after the next election for the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, it would advocate checking all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ships that enter Japanese waters for nuclear weapons. In elections last month, the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> lost their majority in the upper house. The disclosure in May that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hydrogen bomb was lost near an island in southernmost <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> 24 years ago stirred anger among citizens and opposition politicians. After investigating, the government last month said the area had normal radiation levels and was safe.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, expressing concern that he might `` miss some subtlety'' in signals from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new leadership, said Wednesday he is determined to pursue every diplomatic avenue to free American hostages without `` trading off or negotiating.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a question and answer session with reporters, reminded <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of his Inauguration Day message that `` goodwill will beget goodwill'' and said he could send no `` clearer signal'' of his interest to win the release of American hostages and forge a new relationship with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The president said the lives of the hostages are `` too precious for me to be sticking my head in the sand and miss some subtlety in this highly complicated corner of the world.'' His comments were the latest turn in a series of remarks by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, both of whom have used public forums in recent days to discuss the international diplomatic stirrings aimed at freeing the western hostages held in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> indicated that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> would help obtain freedom for the hostages if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> released billions of dollars in Iranian assets impounded a decade ago. The administration has rejected linking the hostages and the assets, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` My view is to do nothing that will be seen as quid pro quo for hostages.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said there were mixed signals from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> about its intentions. As for himself, he recalled the rhetorical open hand he extended to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> on the day he took office. `` I'm not talking about terms, I'm talking about talking to get people out that are held against their will,'' he said. `` And I think I covered that pretty well in my inaugural address when I said goodwill will beget goodwill. And if ever there was a clearer signal, in my view that's it. `` So I repeat it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` And if there are changes taking place -LRB- in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> -RRB- and signals that are shifting, I do n't want to miss a signal.'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration was `` being very careful with our language, trying to keep the possibility of dialogue open. We want to be encouraging of improved relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s adviser, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said the prime minister repeated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s position that it will free Shiite Moslem cleric <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON> only in exchange for three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and `` all the hostages.'' Sixteen Western hostages are held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including eight Americans. The call was originiated by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, according to a senior <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official speaking on condition that he not be identified. He said <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> felt <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would `` appreciate the personal contact.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the president and other administration leaders denied that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was shifting its policy about the way it deals with terrorists and kidnappers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration _ and <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s before him _ had flatly ruled out any negotiations, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seemed to hint at some change in an interview Tuesday with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. He told the newspaper, `` We do not negotiate in any way that's going to jeopardize the lives of other Americans'' _ a statement that seemed to suggest that some form of negotiations would be acceptable <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there was no change in policy. He said the administration had come up with the new phrasing for the policy `` to give definition to it because everybody else has tried to do it for us.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in his meeting with reporters in the Oval Office, said, `` I do n't think there's any subtle change'' from the position of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I'm not going to do anything that would put some other American _ perhaps in some other place, at some other time _ at risk, and that means trading off or negotiating for hostages,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` I hope I'm open-minded enough to talk and to exercise every diplomatic channel I can to free these Americans. ... No American is going to be content until these people are free. And I would not be doing my job if I did n't approach it in that manner.'' The president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to press a diplomatic effort on the hostages' behalf, reaching out to as many countries as possible. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said some countries previously on the sidelines of the hostage crisis now are giving assistance to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they are `` infuriated or angered or repulsed'' by a videotape purporting to show the hanging of Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> and another videotape showing American hostage <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> urging the release of a Moslem cleric who was kidnapped by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` They've been so offended by that, regardless of their view on the politics of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or any other area, that we are finding more and more of a willingness to help,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. In his interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had described him as cautiously optimistic about the hostages but the president went on to add in the interview, `` I have no reason to say that I can see, in a short run, a total resolution of the holding of American-hostage problem.'' He said Wednesday, `` I'm conducting the foreign policy of this country in a prudent manner that I hope will get these people out of there. But the last thing I want to do is elevate the hopes of these families who have been disappointed over and over again to have those hopes dashed.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invited the press to the Oval Office as he posed for pictures with Cardinal <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Law </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leader from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged Americans to say a prayer this weekend for the hostages and their families.

<HEAD>15 Sri Lankans Sentenced for Attempted Coup in Maldives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The High Court in the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION> Wednesday sentenced 15 Sri Lankans to prison terms from 17 to 20 years each for participating in an attempted coup in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> archipelago, the Maldivian government said. On Tuesday, the court sentenced six Sri Lankans to death and ordered imprisonment of six others, according to statements telexed to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Maldivian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. Fifty-five Sri Lankans have so far been convicted for the Nov. 3 coup attempt, which left at least 17 people killed. Twelve have been given death sentences and the others were sentenced to prison from 17 to 38 years each. No dates have been set for the executions. Sentencing in the two-month trial began Sunday, the statement said. There is no higher court of appeal and only President <PERSON> Maumoon </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayoom </PERSON> can commute the sentences. The court has also fined the convicted men $ 14 million as compensation for deaths, injuries and damage to <LOCATION> Maldivian </LOCATION> property, the statement said. At least 68 Sri Lankans and seven Maldivians were arrested after Indian paratroopers landed in Male, the capital of the <LOCATION> Maldives </LOCATION>, to crush the attempted overthrow. The Maldivian government says the coup was led by a Sri Lanka-based Maldivian, <PERSON> Abdullah </PERSON> <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON>, who was aided by mercenaries belonging to the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, one of the several separatist groups that had participated in the war for an independent Tamil nation in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Luthufi </PERSON> is among the defendants still on trial. The Maldives are a string of 2,000 coral islands about 500 miles south of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and roughly the same distance southwest of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Only about 200 of the islands are inhabited.

<TEXT>
 Rebels seized dozens of villagers in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> and then massacred 54 of them with axes, clubs and machetes near the southern coastal town of <LOCATION> Xai-Xai </LOCATION>, the official news agency AIM said Wednesday. AIM said 13 women and eight children were among those slaughtered on Monday night by guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> and that 17 people were wounded, 15 of them seriously. The agency, citing a report in <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said most of the victims were kidnapped and forcibly marched to the <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> village, just outside <LOCATION> Xai-Xai </LOCATION> and about 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Maputo </LOCATION>, the capital. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s civil war has gone on for 12 years. It has resulted in an estimated 600,000 deaths, created more than a million refugees and left nearly half of the nation's 14.7 million people dependent on food aid. No government acknowledges supporting the insurrectionists. The attack came while rebel leaders and government representatives were in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION> trying to resolve the war. Mozambican churchmen, acting on behalf of the government, met the rebels Tuesday, but no major breakthroughs were reported. The guerrillas have been accused of widespread civilian atrocities in their battle to undermine <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s socialist government. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> openly supported the rebels until 1984, but says it since has abided by a mutual non-aggression pact with neighboring <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON> said recently he accepted South African statements that it no longer aids the rebels. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> still believes the rebels receive help from non-governmental groups in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, however.

<TEXT>
 The government announced Wednesday it would sell 14 state-run companies to the private sector among emergency measures to cut the public deficit and curb 1,000 percent annual inflation. The measures included selling off government shipping operations and official residences in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, according <PERSON> Ronaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> <PERSON> Couto </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s chief of staff.

He said the government would maintain strategic state companies, but he would not elaborate. On Thursday, congressional leaders urged economic reforms to aid <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s ailing economy, including boosting imports to increase industrial competition, and slashing state subsidies and tax breaks to the private sector. In a 30-point document, they also suggested <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> eliminate privileges enjoyed by high officials, including non-essential trips and state-funded publicity campaigns. Plagued by a $ 112 billion foreign debt _ the developing world's largest _ and negative economic growth, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> sorely needs new money to meet an interest payment of $ 3 billion due in September to private foreign banks The government is negotiating an economic agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> that would qualify the country for nearly $ 4 billion in fresh loans withheld by private banks and lending organizations. Creditors have refused to lend more money to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which has been unable to control inflation, monetary expansion or a ballooning public deficit, which is around 7 percent of the $ 300 billion gross national product.

 Two <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> mechanics have been suspended without pay for 90 days following a company investigation into the emergency landing of an airliner in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> last week, a company spokesman said Wednesday.

There were no injuries, and only the left engine was damaged. A <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday the initial investigation showed the two mechanics were responsible for the final check before the plane was turned over to the flight crew. Investigators found a 2 -LCB- foot rubber wheel chock, used to keep planes from rolling on the ground, jammed into the left wheel well, and they believe one in the right wheel well was shaken out. The plane was moved six times the night before the flight, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> has said. The investigators said ground crews sometimes stuff the chocks in the wheel wells when moving planes.

 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> attacked corruption at Housing and Urban Development during <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> administrations Wednesday and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> charged statehouse and congressional districts were `` rigged'' for Democrats. The two men rallied their party members at separate sessions at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislatures </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Republicans had been elected on a mandate to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in government but had instead raised misdeeds to `` a new art form.'' `` The more we turn over the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> record, the more slime oozes into the light,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> told a gathering of about 200 Democratic lawmakers. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, speaking to about 300 Republican legislators in an adjoining banquet hall, asked them to lead an assault on a Democrat-favoring system of statehouse and congressional districts during redistricting in 1991. `` Right now, most legislative and congressional districts are rigged in favor of Democrats,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` Republican candidates received nearly half the congressional vote in 1988, but only make up 40 percent of the seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We believe that the voters have a fundamental right to choose their representatives _ freely and fairly _ to the state legislature and to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They should n't have to go through vote-laundering Democrats in some smoke-filled room to make their opinions known.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said Republicans had used <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> as `` a dumping ground for unemployed Republican political hacks.'' He cited as <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> abuses the building of a housing project in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a country club in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and a swimming pool on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` And just down the road in <LOCATION> Stilwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, they built sewage treatment facilities to serve a single poultry processing plant, which has yet to be opened,'' he said. He said Republicans under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration gave the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> a blank check and `` looked the other way while contractors bribed <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees and gouged the government.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> accused President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of paying lip service to important issues such as the environment and the war on drugs. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also addressed redistricting, saying said there is no bigger priority for Democrats and that it is vital that Democrats maintain their majority status. `` What I mean is that the pen that draws those lines is in the hands of good Democrats,'' he said. `` We need to target our resources to make sure that we hold that pen. `` The Republicans have threatened to litigate us to death on redistricting plans and we expect them to do it.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said politics of the next decade will be shaped by what happens during redistricting. `` The political landscape of the nation over the next 10 years is going to be determined by whether we have a fair redistricting in 1991,'' he said. `` When Democrats look to the future, this rigged system of representation is about all they have left,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. `` We're the party of the future The Democrats are the party of the political machine.'' He said Republicans are within six seats of winning a majority in 20 state legislative chambers and `` fair redistricting is within our grasp.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces blockaded <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> for more than three hours Wednesday after two American soldiers were arrested, then withdrew after the troopers were exchanged for two arrested Panamanians. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> helicopters circled overhead during the confrontation, and Panamanian troops could be seen aiming anti-aircraft weapons at them. <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> is a shared area that includes barracks for Panamanian troops, a building where Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has an office, offices of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> offices, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval station and a golf course used by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> personnel. Sources said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces and the country's de facto ruler, was not at the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION> office Wednesday. Col. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said the incident began when a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military policeman was arrested near <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorillo </LOCATION>, where the Panamanian Defense Forces general staff has its headquarters. The soldier was taken to nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>, where another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military policeman was arrested when he tried to obtain his comrade's release, <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops then arrested two Panamanian military policemen at the gates to the fort and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and armored personnel carriers blockaded the entrance until the men were released. Arresting the Americans may have been retaliation for the brief detention by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities on Tuesday of 29 Panamanians, including <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s brother-in-law and eight other soldiers. Panamanian military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed <PERSON> Sconyers </PERSON>' account but gave no reason for the initial arrest. The Southern Command and the Defense Forces later accused each other of violating agreements relating to movements of their respective troops in the area. `` They are trying to humilitate us in our own house,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimaldo </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will not be trapped into provocation, in order not to respond to Yankee arrogance.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said the actions did not violate the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, under which `` the commander of a military area of coordination has responsibility for the security of his area.'' Civilians, including reporters, were allowed across the line during the blockade at <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>, but not Panamanian soldiers. Reporters watched about three hours later as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian officers met and exchanged the soldiers. The five armored personnel carriers withdrew and the entrance was reopened. The blockade delayed a Panamanian anti-terrorist unit that planned to hold an exercise at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>, a 15-story building in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, because the unit could not take trucks and other equipment out of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Amador </LOCATION>. A few dozen soldiers from the two countries lined a street that divides nearby <LOCATION> Quarry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> headquarters is located, from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said 29 Panamanians were detained 75 minutes Tuesday because they entered a joint-use military area without authorization. Among them were four military officers, including Maj. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s brother-in-law. Weapons taken from them included four automatic rifles, a machine gun, two grenades and seven pistols, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled debate for Friday on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s complaint that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to undermine it. Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last year on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. He denied the charges and fought off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to force him to quit, including economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fire Strikes Sled Maker Amid Foreclosure Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOUTH PARIS, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fire blamed on faulty wiring broke out Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's oldest manufacturer of wooden sleds and toboggans, but did n't interfere with a foreclosure auction. First Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> initially said fires which erupted in two separate painting booths in the wood-frame manufacturing plant appeared suspicious. But by midmorning, investigators from the state fire marshal's office had traced the blaze to an electrical problem. <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> said a frayed wire short-circuited and ignited one of the painting booths. Fueled by lacquer, the fire activated the sprinkler system and the sudden blast of water blew burning lacquer into the other booth, he said. Damage was confined largely to the painting booths. Wednesday was the second and final day of an auction closing the books on one of western <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s best-known industries. The sale was intended to clear the company's $ 1.8 million debt to <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, guaranteed by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. Tuesday's sale brought in $ 54,750 for a 27.3-acre site with saw mill, storage buildings and equipment, and an additional $ 27,000 for a nearby 22-acre tract. The remaining property auctioned Wednesday included the main manufacturing plant.

<HEAD>Thousands Of Jews Pray At Western Wall To Mourn Lost Temple</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Jews prayed Wednesday night at the sacred Western Wall in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to mourn the destruction of their temple by the Romans 1919 years ago. The nightlong prayer marked the start of <PERSON> Tisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Be-Av </PERSON>, or the ninth of the Jewish lunar month of Av, the greatest day of mourning in the Jewish calendar. The holiday this year was also marked by heavy security measures linked to the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and the annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and fears of a possible terror attack. Hundreds of police officers and paramilitary border policemen guarded the Western Wall square inside the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Police also erected a special electronic gate at the entrance to the Western Wall square and said no weapons would be allowed near the sacred stones. <PERSON> Tisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Be-Av </PERSON> commemorates the destruction of the First Temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> by the Babylonians in 586 B.C. and the destruction of the Second Temple by the Roman emperor <PERSON> Titus </PERSON> in 70 a.d. The Western Wall is the last remnant of that temple. The body of Jewish religious teachings lists other disasters said to have accurred on that day, such as the fall of <PERSON> Beitar </PERSON>, the last stronghold of anti-Roman Jewish rebels, in 135 A.D. and the creation of a Roman temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> a year later. During the ages, <PERSON> Tisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Be-Av </PERSON> had become a symbol of misfortune and persecution that befell the Jewish people. The expulsion of Jews from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> in 1492, during the period of the Inquisition, is also said to have occurred on that day. The mourning for past tragedies is marked by fasting and prayer. Near the Western Wall, religious Jews chant sections from the Scroll of Lamentations or the Book of Job, sitting on the ground or on low stools. <PERSON> Tisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Be-Av </PERSON> lasts from nightfall till afternoon on the next day. During that period, Jews are forbidden to eat, drink, and bathe. Although work is technically allowed, it is customary to abstain from it. Many Israeli businesses closed for 24 hours. Restaurants and movie houses also closed or faced a fine.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to name former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> national security adviser Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, a senior administration official said Wednesday. The four-star Army general would become the first black to hold the post as the nation's senior military officer. Upon confirmation by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the 52-year-old <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> would succeed Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who is to retire Sept. 30. The source, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said the White House is expected to make the announcement on Thursday. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> made the recommendation to the president and informed the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, said the official. The chairman is the principal military adviser to the president and the secretary of defense. Under a new management organization instituted by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, the chairman also wields greater influence over military budgets than in the past. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to name <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> means that the four-star Army general jumps into the position over several more senior officers. He would be the youngest to sit in the chairman's chair, and one of the few not to have attended one of the service academies. A leading candidate for the position has been <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Herres </PERSON>, vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> distinguished himself in the highly visible White House role and was well known to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his tenure as vice president. He has not hesitated to speak to groups of young blacks, warning them of their duty to help others and to protect the gains of the civil rights revolution. `` Do n't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved the way for you,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduates this spring. `` The greatest danger ... is complacency.'' President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tapped <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> for the White House post in November 1987 after <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> had worked 10 months as deputy to national security adviser <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to reform the scandal-wracked office in the days following the Iran-Contra affair. Currently, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McPherson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, where he has been in charge of keeping the 1 million active, reserve and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ready for combat. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also served as a chief aide to former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> in 1983-1986 and commanded the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 5th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for six months. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was born of Jamaican immigrant parents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and raised in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in 1958 after earning a bachelor's degree in geology at the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, and later earned a master's degree in business administration from <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. He served in the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> in 1972 during a term as a White House fellow. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1962 and again in 1968, and holds the Bronze Star for valor and a Purple Heart.

<HEAD>9 Top Contra Officers Request U.S. Asylum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nine top Contra military officers, including the rebel chief of staff, requested political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday and three were immediately approved, immigration officials said. The action came two days after five Central American presidents agreed on a plan to demobilize the Contras within four months. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galeano </LOCATION>, the rebel chief of staff known as <PERSON> Comandante </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, was among the officers filing claims at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The officers denied there was a connection between their applications and the accord signed Monday by five <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents in <LOCATION> Tela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, calling for the dismantling of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s anti-Sandinista forces. `` We're doing this errand to facilitate our struggle,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgadillo </PERSON>, a political adviser on the southern front who also was granted asylum. <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> said the Contra leaders have no plans to move to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, telling The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> that the officers sought nothing more than `` travel documents.'' `` Some of us have the need right now to mobilize in the international field,'' <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> said. `` There is a need to get documents to travel.'' <PERSON> Delgadillo </PERSON> admitted the action could be misinterpreted by the estimated 12,000 rebel troops languishing in border camps. `` It could be demoralizing to the troops if we were seen as retiring from the struggle,'' <PERSON> Delgadillo </PERSON> said. `` But the troops know that's not so. Our struggle continues.'' He voiced bitterness at the <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> agreement. `` We do n't want to live like slaves to the signature of the presidents,'' he said. `` We want to go on being rebels.'' Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> declared that the plan spells the death of the rebel movement. The Sandinista government agreed to democratic reforms leading up to national elections in return for the repatriation or resettlement of the Contras by Dec. 8. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which lobbied to keep the Contras intact as a fighting force until <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s February 1990 elections, has reluctantly embraced the five presidents' accord. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military aid to the rebels in February 1988. <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> vowed Wednesday to continue his fight with `` limitless human resources'' and return to the jungled mountains of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> if the Contras are kicked out of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. `` Each government has acted on nothing more than its own selfish interest,'' he said. `` We're the ones who are paying the price.'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said the claims were given `` special action'' status and reviewed immediately. `` Because of the nature of their positions and possible security problems, we ask that their cases be moved fast,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. A complete list of the nine commanders was not available Wednesday, but the names that were known included: <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, known as <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON>; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> `` Emmanuel'' <PERSON> Aguilar </PERSON>, a southern front commander; and Fremio `` <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leo </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamirano </PERSON>, a northern front commander.

 Well-wishers around the country lit up the telephones in Rep. <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s office Wednesday as his staff spent a third day waiting for word about the missing congressman. <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Democrat and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger, disappeared Monday after his twin-engine plane took off from <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> on its way to a refugee camp on <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>, about 480 miles away. `` We're still waiting, anxiously,'' legislative assistant <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told a caller. `` We're waiting for him to call us up and ask us for his messages.'' Inside <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s personal office at the <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building, spokeswoman <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> sat at his desk conducting a string of interviews that she said keeps her mind off the grim possibilities. `` Everything is in their favor at this point. The weather is temperate, it's not too hot or cold, and these planes do carry adequate provisions. They're not in any immediate danger on the ground,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s since their college days. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> stopped by the office and said a prayer for <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> with his staff, while <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON>, answered the phnes, paced the marble hallways and waited. `` There may be some concern that I'm not up here crying,'' Ms. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> told reporters. `` Congressman <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> is an exceptionally positive person. He does not want people who are not positive around him. ... I just absolutely have not heard anything that would cause alarm.'' `` We feel he's just landed, stranded and waiting to get in touch with us,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said between phone calls. Thirteen othrs were on the plane with <PERSON> Leland </PERSON>, including two of his staff members. The aircraft was last heard from 15 minutes after taking off Monday morning. As nightfall in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> ended the second day of an air and ground search with no word, Ms. <PERSON> Newsom </PERSON> said staff members were not letting themselves `` be anything but upbeat.'' Meanwhile, prayers and good wishes continued to pour in.

 Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, who is expected to be named the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, is described by colleagues as a `` soldier's soldier'' who does n't particularly like staff jobs. The four-star Army general, who became national security adviser in 1987 and heads the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Forces Command at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McPherson </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, would become the first black to serve as the nation's senior military officer The 52-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was highly regarded by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, succeeding <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser. `` He was the general who guided preparations for the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> following the Iran-Contra investigation, and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> itself,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. Those qualities were cited by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in calling <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> the `` antidote to <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>,'' the former <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> aide convicted in the Iran-Contra scandal. `` Colin gets mad at me when I say this, but I think he should go to the very top of the military establishment _ up to and including chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> has said. A senior administration official said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to name <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> to the position. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> took over <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Forces Command, or FORSCOM, in April, putting him in charge of troop readiness and deployment for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In interviews since then, he has emphasized he's proud of the accomplishments of the average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier over the years. In the old days, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said, soldiers would keep a pinball machine in a corner of their barracks. `` Today there's a computer there.'' On personal level, however, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> does n't always keep up with the times. You'd only know the 1972 Chrysler station wagon parked in the general's space each day was his by reading the four-star decal on its front. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> colleagues have described <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> as a `` soldier's soldier'' who does n't like staff jobs <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> says that <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> has always been reluctant to be a bureaucrat and that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> to accept the job of national security adviser after the general had turned <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> down several times. In his time off, he tells young blacks to spend their lives helping to open doors for minorities. `` Do n't squander the blood, sweat and tears of those who paved the way for you,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduates this spring. `` The greatest danger ... is complacency.'' He tells of his battles with racial discrimination, recalling the time an <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> state trooper pulled him over for speeding in the early 1960s. The trooper looked at the car, complete with <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> plates and an <ORGANIZATION> LBJ </ORGANIZATION> bumper sticker, and hissed, `` Boy, get out of here.'' On the job, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> emphasizes his commitment to obtaining resources for his troops, a task he said was top priority when he became FORSCOM commander. As leader of <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> is responsible for the training and preparedness of more than 1 million active, reserve and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>'s daily interests are more pressing: Keeping his troops ready for combat `` with the hope they will never be needed.'' And in that position, he keeps a close eye on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets are going through wrenching historic change, beginning with the irreversible acknowledgement that their system is broken and has to be changed,'' he said at his FORSCOM installation. But `` their FORSCOM is strong. We must be strong.''

<HEAD>Antarctica Expedition Sleds Crash; Reduced to 2{ Sleds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Explorers crossing <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> with dog sleds spent the past two days trying to salvage two of their three sleds, which were damaged when they crashed in a descent on ice, a spokeswoman said Wednesday night. The international team led by <PERSON> Minnesotan </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> tore down both damaged sleds and reconstructed them into one full-sized sled and a half-sized sled, said expedition spokeswoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMoll </PERSON>. `` We were careening down some steep blue ice. The two Komatek homestead sleds crashed together and rolled, splitting the runners lengthwise,'' <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> said in a fax received Wednesday at the expedition's headquarters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. `` It was a big mistake,'' he said. `` We should have been using ropes.'' Blue ice is hard, smooth ice that has been blown clear of snow. <PERSON> DeMoll </PERSON> said the accident occurred in an area with very low visibility, and the second sled could n't slow down on the incline. None of the six team members was injured, nor were any of the dogs. The team had been crossing its first piece of land, the <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Peninsula </PERSON>, rather than the flatter, smoother ice shelf, and have encountered what <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> called `` a minefield of crevasses, many of them deep _ very deep.'' The 36 dogs, which normally run 12 to a sled, will likely be resdistributed along with the team's load as the group continues its 4,000-mile journey, <PERSON> DeMoll </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steger </PERSON>'s group ruled out the expense of sending in a spare sled by plane, and instead hopes to make it until the scheduled resupply mission on Aug. 25. <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> and fellow International Trans-Antarctica Expedition members from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since last month have been making a first-ever attempt to cross <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> from west to east.

<TEXT>
 At least 23 people died in ethnic strife over the past 24 hours and Sinhalese extremists captured sophisticated weaponry in a raid on an air force base, the government said Wednesday. The government also said it would take control of the port of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. For two years, <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping troops have had virtual authority over the port, which is one of the world's largest natural harbors. On Wednesday, Sri Lankan industrialist <PERSON> Kanagasabai </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunaratnam </PERSON> was slain by two men on a motorcycle as he sat in his car in <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, a company spokesman said on condition of anonymity. Police said motives for the slaying of 72-year-old <PERSON> Gunaratnam </PERSON> were unclear, although they appeared related to the island nation's ethnic strife Among other victims were six members of a family in <LOCATION> Gampha </LOCATION>, 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. Military officials blamed the deaths on the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Sinhalese extremist group. It was not immediately clear how the other victims died. The front has targeted government officials and supporters, saying <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> has made too many concessions to the Tamil minority, who have been fighting since 1983 for a separate nation in northern and eastern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. Government troops searched Wednesday for Sinhalese extremists who raided an air force camp at <LOCATION> Vavuniya </LOCATION>, 135 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. The guerrillas escaped with a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, three rockets, and a Chinese light machine gun. A spokesman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy, said he was unaware of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s announcement. The Sinhalese majority controls the government, military and economy. Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of the island's 16 million people, say they are discriminated against in jobs, education and language. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> intervened in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s internal strife after the two nations signed a peace agreement in July 1987 to end the Tamil rebellion. Indian peacekeeping troops arrived in the nation's northeast to disarm the rebels, but the largest guerrilla faction reneged on the peace agreeement <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> now wants the Indian force out. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the port of <LOCATION> Trincomalee </LOCATION>, which harbors more than 100 ships, would be placed under control of the Sri Lankan navy. At its peak, the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping force numbered 70,000, but tapered off to 45,000 by February. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> resumed troop withdrawals on July 29, and the force now numbers about 43,000.

 Delegates to a summit meeting on trade among <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries said they were offended by a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Administration official's joke about <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women and his attack on Marxism. `` It was only a joke, but I do n't like the joke,'' said <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zu-wen </PERSON>, commercial consul for the Chinese Consulate in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` He's a joker.

Mimicking a stereotypical Chinese accent, <PERSON> Zeder </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> replied: `` Only one thing certain. <PERSON> Aristotle </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> would not have married Mrs. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 The federal government has dropped a lawsuit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> of falsifying tests on MX missile guidance devices and has agreed not to refile it, the aerospace company said Wednesday. Federal prosecutors could not immediately be reached to explain why they dropped the $ 3 million suit. It had alleged fraud and violations of the False Claims Act, saying tests on about 20 heat exchangers for the MX were never properly conducted. A lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> `` whistleblowers'' characterized the suit as just a tiny piece of a mosaic of multimillion-dollar civil and criminal cases filed by former and present <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employees and the government. `` Unfortunately for <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, our cases are alive and well and moving through both the civil and criminal courts,'' attorney <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> said. The company has denied the accusations of overcharges and falsifying tests, which involve the cruise missile and stealth bomber as well as the MX missile. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> said the heat exchanger suit, filed in federal court here in August 1987, was `` dismissed with prejudice'' by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> last week, meaning it can not be refiled. `` The government's action in dismissing the case with prejudice clearly establishes that none of these violations occurred,'' a company statement said. Heat exchangers remove heat generated by a guidance system component known as the inertial measurement unit, a basketball-sized device that guides nuclear missiles to their targets. The case arose when a heat exchanger component and a test stand exploded during testing in January 1986. As part of the dismissal of the case, <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay the government $ 45,045 for the damage to government equipment. <PERSON> Cantafio </PERSON> declined to describe what led up to the dismissal of the suit, which the company announced late in the day. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> referred calls to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s special civil litigation section in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which had closed for the day. <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON>, the lead attorney for several <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employees who have sued <PERSON> Northop </PERSON> under the False Claims Act, characterized the case as relatively insignificant. `` <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> is a hell of a lot better at issuing press releases than it is at building missiles,'' <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> said. `` That press release is designed to deceive the public and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> into believing that a small government case somehow affects our major cases and charges.'' The False Claims Act allows workers or executives who sue their employers for fraud against the government to recover as much as 30 percent of any damages awarded. The federal government has the option of joining such suits, but so far has not done so in an MX missile case <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> filed on behalf of several plaintiffs led by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> employee. The case accuses <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> of overcharging, falsifying tests and using faulty parts on the guidance system for the MX missile, and <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> said damages could run more than $ 100 million. The government has joined another of <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON>'s civil suits, a $ 30 million case involving allegations of faked tests on the guidance system for the cruise missile. A federal grand jury has issued a related criminal indictment accusing <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and five employees of fraud and conspiracy for allegedly falsifying tests on nuclear-armed cruise missiles and for supplying equipment that the government knew failed to meet specifications. Another <PERSON> Hafif </PERSON> lawsuit involves allegations that <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in overcharges and false tests on the stealth bomber. The government has so far declined to join that case.

 American-run assembly plants are asking the government to help end a wildcat strike now in its third week that has idled 2,000 workers along the U.S.-Mexico border, company officials said Wednesday. `` Everything is on hold. We're waiting to see what the government will do,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON>, vice president of the local industry assocation in <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, just south of <LOCATION> McAllen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The strike involves a dispute between two labor leaders vying for control of workers in <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> said. The strike is the worst to hit the border industries, which import raw materials and equipment duty-free, use cheap Mexican labor and then export the goods. It has idled 15 such plants since it began 16 days ago. Local industry has lost an estimated $ 500,000 daily said <PERSON> Osvaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, another business leader. `` This is a very critical situation for <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said. `` Both local and international investors must have guarantees of labor stability if they're going to risk their capital.'' The so-called `` maquiladora'' industry is one of the fastest-growing maanufacturing activities in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. About 1,400 plants are strung along the Mexican side of the border, employing 392,000 workers. In 1985 about 800 plants with 218,000 employees were operating. <PERSON> Gaffney </PERSON> said the strike was caused by a dispute among <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>'s three unions representing the maquiladora industry All three are affiliated with the Federation of Mexican Workers, the country's biggest labor organization <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, general secretary of one union and a leader of another, is trying to control all three labor organizations and many union members are resisting. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>' union put up strike banners across the gates of 11 plants July 25 and kept workers out.

 Thai pirates took pleading Vietnamese refugees from the hold of a boat one by one, beat them with sticks and iron rods and then hacked them to death, survivors told refugee officials Wednesday. The officials said 71 Vietnamese were reported dead. The pirates sank the refugees' boat by ramming it twice with their own boat and then systematically killed survivors swimming in the sea, they added. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhouri </PERSON>, chief representative in <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refugees </ORGANIZATION>, said 13 who survived were interviewed Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> refugee officials and gave this account: Their boat left <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on Thursday, Aug. 3, carrying 58 men, 15 women and 11 children. On Saturday night, two fishing boats intercepted them and towed them for some distance. Fishing crew boarded their boat and robbed them of their valuables. Some Vietnamese were transferred to the fishing boats. The rest were kept in the hold of the refugee boat. The fishermen-pirates then brought up men singly from the hold, clubbed them and then killed them with axes, the refugee officials said. The men cried and pleaded, but the pirates, whom they ascertained to be Thais because of their appearance and language, showed no mercy. `` In the panic that followed, others tried to storm out of the hold, but were contained by the pirates, who tied fishing nets over the opening. The trapped men then tried to cut their way through the nets without success,'' <PERSON> Fakhouri </PERSON> reported, quoting the survivors. He said the ramming, sinking and killing of Vietnamese in the water followed, but 13 survived by swimming to an oil rig, where workers rescued them. The rig, off <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Trengganu </LOCATION>, 180 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, was operated by <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of Exxon of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The latest incident brought to 271 the number of refugees reported killed by pirates in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> this year in four attacks.

 Backers of a plan to authorize casino gambling in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> conceded defeat Wednesday after failing in a last-minute push Wednesday to place a proposal on the Nov. 7 ballot, officials said. The casino advocates notified the state shortly before 10 p.m. that they had given up the effort to get enough petition signatures by a midnight deadline, said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Fought </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Secretary of State's office. Auto dealer <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, spokesman for the group and a potential casino owner, seemed to concede defeat at a news conference Wednesday afternoon and made plans for a similar effort for the 1990 ballot. The proposal got new life, however, when the Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s office agreed to accept the signatures until midnight, Fought said. The group needed 306,661 signatures, or 10 percent of the number of people who voted in the 1986 governor's election, to put the proposed constitutional amendment on the ballot. <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> LUV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ LUV stands for Let Us Vote _ collected between 250,000 and 275,000 signatures. <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>'s committee began petitions in June after the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, despite passage by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, rejected a bill authorizing a casino in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>. The ballot proposal would go further. It would permit casinos in seven so-called casino districts, generally surrounding and including <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s largest cities, subject to approval of voters in local elections. <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON>, whose family owns car dealerships throughout central and northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, says the plan would help create jobs and boost the economy. He has talked of building a $ 300 million to $ 400 million resort complex and casino in an abandoned shipyard in <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, saying it would breathe new life into the northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> steel city's economy. At a news conference, <PERSON> Spitzer </PERSON> blamed a late start on the petition drive and a lack of people needed to circulate petitions. `` Time and people _ we did n't have enough of either,'' he said.

 The stock market's recent climb toward record highs is worrying some investors who wonder whether the elevation in stock prices will be followed by a plunge like the October 1987 crash. Nearly a third of the paper value of stocks was wiped out in the crash and the weeks preceeding it. With the market on a path remarkably similar to the one it followed the months before the crash, comparisons to 1987 are being drawn. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.18 to finish at 2,699.17 Tuesday, approaching the record 2,722.42 close of Aug. 25, 1987. The current rally's apologists point to dissimilarities in market conditions between then and now that they contend should lead to a much happier outcome this time.

 <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Purchase </PERSON> spends most afternoons trading gossip with a slow parade of drug addicts on a gritty downtown sidewalk. But Purchase, a cheerful, engaging man, has something else to swap with the drug users he calls `` just folks'' and counts among his friends. `` How ya doin', pumpkin?'' he asks a woman with haunted eyes as he hands her a clean hypodermic needle for the used one she drops into a little red box sitting on a folding table. `` Not too bad,'' she says with a tired smile. `` That's great,'' Purchase booms. `` That's great.'' A woman with a headful of tiny black braids brings Purchase a pair of needles she had used to feed a heroin habit. She lingers in the feeble sunshine with fellow junkies to watch the action. Down the street, a squad car screeches to a stop and a policeman alights to drag a fallen-down drunk to the curb. `` I shoot heroin ... I'm a dope fiend,'' the woman with braids tells a visitor. `` But I come down here most every day for clean needles. I like the high, man, but I do n't want to die for it. I do n't want no AIDS.'' The 31-year-old woman, who gave her name only as <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON>, talks of enrolling in a treatment program to kick her 10-year habit. She points at Purchase. `` The rig man there _ he cares what happens to us.'' In this neighborhood of half-abandoned buildings, sagging fences, and weed-choked lots, Purchase and his crew of county health workers have built what is hailed as the nation's first successful program to reduce the number of dirty needles among drug addicts in an attempt to slow the spread of AIDS. The program, which swaps 1,500 clean needles for dirty ones a week, is being studied or at least partly duplicated in places like <LOCATION> Honululu </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Observers are impressed by an unexpected bonus: new access to elusive inner-city addicts and a chance to help break their habits. Critics include <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials who say backers of such programs have yet to show they slow the spread of AIDS. State lawmakers and some treatment experts say <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>'s program not only violates the state's drug paraphernelia law, but that it tacitly sanctions illegal drug use. `` To put up a little table to exchange needles like Mr. <PERSON> Purchase </PERSON> does is like Alcoholics Anonymous putting up a bar on the sidewalk and giving out free drinks while passing out pamphlets against drunk driving,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Tacoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> is just up the street from where Purchase hands out needles every afternoon but Sunday. Purchase has little patience for critics like <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>. `` You know what these people are really saying? They are saying, ` Let'em die.' Either that or they have n't seen the evidence that needle-sharing is spreading AIDS.'' Purchase, 49, a former drug counselor, won local government funding and staff in January after launching the program with his own money a year ago as a personal war on the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The $ 45,000 program's purpose is simple, he said. `` If you want to slow the spread of AIDS, you have to slow the spread through dirty needles.'' Homosexual contact has been surpassed by shared needles as a cause of AIDS' spread. Intravenous drug users account for 27 percent of all AIDS cases nationally; as of mid-July, 99,936 Americans had contracted the disease and 58,014 of those had died. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 1,383 had been diagnosed and 753 of them have died. Purchase's war on dirty needles has drawn applause in the sad underground of street addicts and among many health officials. But he is quick to note he'd be out of business if authorities decided to enforce a misdemeanor state law against delivering or possessing syringes without a prescription. <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> officials have permitted the program to continue because `` these people are not trying to commit criminal acts'' but rather are waging a war on AIDS, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Felnagle </PERSON>, chief criminal deputy prosecutor for <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Purchase, a drug counselor for 20 years, says he owes addicts a great deal. which is why he contracted with a medical supply house a year ago to distribute needles himself, no questions asked. `` I worked in the business since 1969. These people paid my mortgage, put food on my table; I mean I've been living off their misery for 20 years like any decent social worker. I decided to do something for them.'' County Health Director Dr. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, is excited at the new bridge to this industrial port city's most elusive underclass _ longtime IV drug users. `` You do have to go to people you might not feel comfortable with, on their terms, and be willing to wash their feet, so to speak, if you want to reach them.'' Working out of a van, Purchase and his crew also hand out condoms, little bottles of bleach to clean needles, and blueberry muffins. An outreach health worker is always with them, ready to offer counseling and other help. County officials say they have found a `` substantial decrease'' in needle sharing as a result of the program and have referred more than 150 addicts for treatment after Purchase and his crew cultivated a relationship with them. Opponents like <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> and state lawmaker <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> physician who failed this year to win legislation against needle exchange, note that backers have not demonstrated the program slows the spread of AIDS. Worse, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> asserts, the program is unnecessary because AIDS among local IV drug users is no where near as bad as in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and elsewhere. `` They are using East Coast statistics to justify the idea here,'' he said. He bristled at the suggestion that he would just as soon let AIDS victims die. `` We spend over $ 2 million a year on drug and alcohol programs. Does that sound like somebody who wants to let them die?'' Another heath department spokesman, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, said it's unfair to expect the program to demonstrate in less than several years that it slows the spread of AIDS. `` How can you demonstrate success a year after the program starts when the incubation period for the disease is about seven years?'' Purchase puts it another way: `` If we're wrong, then we wasted a few cents a needle. If we're right, we saved a lot of lives.'' As a steady stream of addicts stopped at Purchase's table, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> leaned against a wall and explained addicts' willingness to use the program: `` We do n't have to give our name. We do n't have to do nothin' but bring the rig man a dirty needle for a clean one and the cops do n't bother us It's easy, and I think it's workin'. Hey, dope fiends are n't sharin' their needles like they used to,'cause they can get clean ones without a lot of problems.''

<HEAD>Many Hispanic Catholics Shifting To Evangelical Congregations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Although most were reared in Roman Catholicism, Hispanics in growing numbers are switching to evangelical churches, pleasing those congregations but worrying <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders. Both seek to meet special needs of Spanish-descended Americans. Swelled by a modern tide of immigration, they now number nearly 20 million in this country, most of them Catholics. But studies indicate a heavy defection rate to Protestant churches of evangelical style. `` The movement of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanics to evangelical Protestantism is a historic event of great significance,'' says the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> <PERSON> Deck </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> specialist on Hispanic ministry. `` Protestantism is achieving a foothold in the Hispanic world, a massive presence, that it has never enjoyed before.'' Evidence of such evangelical inroads into Catholicism has turned up in many Latin American countries as well as in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Deck, of the <ORGANIZATION> Jesuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theology </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, says the success of the evangelicals `` is directly related to the heat, the passion, with which its adherents communicate their message.'' `` Hispanics generally like that,'' he writes in the national <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> weekly, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, but it's not the style of the typical orderly, reasoned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholic service, generally shunning emotionalism. Surveys by the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> indicate a steady increase during the last decade in the proportion of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Hispanics who are Protestants, now amounting to 23 percent. That is up from 16 percent in the l970's. In those years, 77 percent listed themselves as <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, and 7 percent other or no religion, but the l982-86 figures indicate only 71 percent remain <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. The Rev. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> sociologist, novelist and a senior associate at the research center, calculates Hispanic shifts from Catholicism to Protestantism at 60,000 a year _ nearly a million over the last 15 years. `` The Protestant segment of Americans of Hispanic origin is not only large, it is growing rapidly,'' he writes in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He notes that the defection rate is lower among Mexican-Americans, 15 percent, than among Puerto Ricans, 24 percent, and others, 26 percent, and lower in the West than in the East. Storefront evangelical churches attracting Hispanics have proliferated in major cities in the East and also on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. `` More than three-fourths of the Spanish-origin Protestants are either Baptists or fundamentalists,'' <PERSON> Greeley </PERSON> says. `` Hispanics have joined fervent <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> groups in which their religion provides them with intense activity and community support,'' he says, adding that Catholicism apparently fails to meet those `` emotional, communal needs.'' The same point is emphasized by <PERSON> Deck </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> Hispanic Theologians in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He says the fundamental problem for Catholicism is the `` inflexibility of the parish,'' whose operations are `` often out of gear with the dispositions and needs of Hispanics.'' `` The sense of being at home _ achieving an environment that is welcoming and familiar _ is extremely hard to attain in the large, urban, ethnically mixed parish,'' he says. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Catholicism is very uncomfortable with the cultural core of Hispanic Catholicsm: popular religiosity. It views all of that as at best quaint and at worst superstitious ... `` Enthusiastic religion and affective approaches are downplayed. ... Our liturgies are orderly and even elegant, our preaching calmly reasoned and conversational. Rhetoric and even eloquence are shunned. ...'' He says the evangelical <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> appeal to Hispanics stresses factors of `` personalism and community,'' small, hospitable congregations and ministers from the Hispanic community. To accomplish those characteristics, he suggests reviving the so-called national or ethnic parishes, popular in past periods of other <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> immigrants, now integrated into society, their special parishes outmoded. However, he says a new wave of immigrants indicates reviving such special arrangements to meet the need of Hispanics `` for a sense of acceptance,'' their `` own turf'' and ministers adapted to their language and customs. Such adaptations are applied in evangelical denominations such as Southern Baptists. It has 2,300 Hispanic pastors and a total of 2,612 Hispanic congregations, up 40 percent in this decade. Catholicism, although more than three times bigger, has fewer Hispanic priests _ estimated under 2,000. United Methodists are working to extend a National Plan for <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, developed in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops at their June meeting in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, took steps for implementing a plan for special efforts among Hispanics to cope with evangelical proselytism. A Catholic bishop criticized some of that proselytism as deceptive. This was disputed by a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> leader, who said Hispanics simply were being offered the Ggospel message of hope.

He took a chance on me.'' In all, <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> has starred in seven <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> movies, including a role as Olive Oyl in `` Popeye.'' She's produced two other series for Showtime. Her first was `` Faerie Tale Theatre'' and the second was `` <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>'s Tall Tales and Legends.'' Her longtime collaborator is <PERSON> Bridget </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, who's producing `` Dinner at Eight,'' starring <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON>, for <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>. Actually, the distance between fairy tales and horror stories is quite short. `` Fairy tales can be very scary,'' said <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON>. `` The Grimm tales particularly can be grim. Many of them were thinly disguised political commentary. When I selected the stories for ` Faerie Tale Theatre' I had to be very careful.'' <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> produced 26 episodes of `` Faerie Tale Theatre,'' which are now in syndication and are available on video cassette. She feels there is a much wider audience for the stories since only about six million people saw them on Showtime. She has also stopped production of `` Tall Tales,'' which is going into syndication and videos. `` When I pitched ` Nightmare Classics' I had the choice of doing that or continuing with ` Tall Tales,''' she said. `` I chose to start the new series. I had a body of work with ` Tall Tales' that I could take and sell elsewhere.'' <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> said she enjoys running her own production company and wants to produce all forms of entertainment. She's much too busy now getting her company started, but said she'd like to try her hand at directing, too.

<HEAD>Bush's Patient Approach Most Striking in a Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 From the outset, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his administration would work patiently, persistently _ but probably not very dramatically _ in the long, agonizing effort to gain freedom for Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. That applies even in time of crisis. It fits the restrained, low-key approach the president and his lieutenants are taking in the current situation, even toward the apparent killing of a kidnapped <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>. There is no lack of anger, outrage and frustration at the White House. But venting it with threats of retribution would do nothing to help the eight Americans still held captive of Shiite Moslem kidnappers. Indeed, the dilemma confronting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as it confronted his predecessors, is that reaction, even retaliation, serves the purposes of the terrorists who set out to create crisis in the first place. The options are few anyhow. When he was vice president, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> headed an administration task force on terrorism which observed in its report that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> principles do not permit random retaliation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was outraged beyond words when the captors of Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> claimed to have hanged him on July 31 in revenge for the kidnapping of Sheik <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> cleric, by Israeli commandos. The president's voice broke with emotion as he praised <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> on Monday, calling him `` one who stands as a symbol of the courage that burns in the breast of every American in uniform. ...'' Hours later, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said its experts had concluded that the man shown hanging in a videotape issued by the kidnappers probably was <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, but did not say how or when he died. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was taken hostage Feb. 17, 1988, while serving with a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping unit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' wife. He made no public statement on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report. The administration says it is actively pursuing diplomatic efforts to gain release of the remaining American hostages. At the same time, it has reinforced the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fleet in the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. On Aug. 1, with <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccipio </PERSON> under death threat, word was relayed to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> that if any more hostages were killed, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would hold <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> responsible. But the White House has been purposefully vague about what action might follow, saying only that there has been planning for every option. So, too, on speculation about possible ways out. `` There are a lot of ideas being floated, a lot of exchanges being made, but it's primarily a matter of talking and listening and not signaling your moves,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` We will be careful not to respond to every new development, new statement, new idea. ...'' He said there are going to be a lot of them. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> also said the administration does not expect a quick resolution of the hostage situation, which already is measured in years. Militant Moslem groups now hold at least 16 foreign hostages. The American held longest is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, now 41, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, seized in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on March 16, 1985. Before he was inaugurated, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would explore every path that might point to freedom for the hostages. He said he could foresee a day of better <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and that it could be hastened by Iranian steps to ease the hostage situation. But he said he did not expect a swift, dramatic breakthrough. Now his administration is trying to transform a crisis into a solution. Offering advice is easier. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted one resolution saying <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should determine whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can retaliate against the killers of <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> `` in a manner that would reduce the risk to Americans from terrorism.'' Then it adopted another asking the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and the Pentagon for a report by Sept. 1 on how best to locate and rescue the remaining American hostages. Neither is realistic but then, neither is binding.

<HEAD>Income Planning for Working Retirees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As they join the growing numbers of the `` working retired'' in this country, many people find themselves facing an unhappy tradeoff. It's common these days to regard retirement as a chance to start a second career, to keep working part time as a consultant, or to see if a longtime hobby can be turned into a legitimate livelihood. But the more money you can earn from such an endeavor, the more likely you are to forfeit some or all of your annual Social Security benefits. Under the rules prevailing this year, retirees aged 62 to 64 lose $ 1 in Social Security benefits for every $ 2 they earn above $ 6,480 in any given year. In the 65 to 69 age group, the cutoff point is $ 8,880. Next year, it's slated to rise to $ 9,360, beyond which $ 1 in benefits will be negated for every $ 3 earned. The restrictions do n't apply to anyone aged 70 or older. If you're drawing Social Security and working at a salaried job, there is n't much you can do about this situation _ other than lobby for, and hope for passage of, legislative proposals to make the limits more generous. But if you can set yourself up as an independent consultant working for yourself and selling your services to others, you may have more flexibility, says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, editor of the monthly Financial Planning Reporter published by the accounting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. In such circumstances, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says, you might consider postponing receipt of income from your work to future years in order to minimize the bite of the Social Security limits. With the notable exception of fees collected by people serving on boards of directors, `` self-employment earnings are only counted when received, not when ` earned,''' he points out. Thus, for example, a 64-year-old retiree doing free-lance carpentry work this fall might choose to delay sending out some bills until yearend, so that payment does n't count toward 1989 earnings. At age 69, the incentive to defer compensation would be especially strong, since earnings are subject to no limit in the following year. To do this sort of thing, of course, you need to be able to establish that you are truly self-employed, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> cautions. `` Providing consulting exclusively to your former employer probably wo n't work,'' he says. Beyond having more than one customer, he observes, `` the real test is the extent of your independence to make your own decisions and set your own schedule.'' There also could be some pitfalls awaiting people who are legally eligible to defer compensation, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> adds. The strategy could go awry if income tax rates are increased in future years. If payment is put off for a significant time, inflation may erode its value and it may not be available for you to invest it for interest, dividends or capital gains. There's also the question of how confident you are about the customer's ability and willingness to pay up when you eventually want to collect. As popular as deferral strategies may be, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> concludes, it is prudent to make sure beforehand that their disadvantages wo n't outweigh their benefits

<HEAD>Give Them Credit, But Not The Financial Kind</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumers have to be given some credit for the manner in which they have behaved in recent months, counting their money and retreating from high prices and borrowing costs. They beat the carmakers at their own game, declining to pay full price and forcing them to offer rebates and discounts in order to cut inventories. They have been slow to buy big-ticket appliances. They are cautious. They have slowed their acquisition of credit, in part because bank card borrowing comes at exorbitant rates these days and lenders refuse to come down in line with other rates. Consumer credit in June did rise, but the tendency to go into debt has receded over the past year. In May, the annual growth rate was 7.3 percent, but in June it dropped to 5.1 percent. The tendency of consumers to watch their dollars does seem contradicted by one area of credit: Bank card credit has continued to rise. However, the disinclination of banks to lower their rates _ 21.5 percent annual interest is n't uncommon _ that consumer resistance, so clear in other ways, seems almost certain. Buyers also slowed the rate of increase in home prices. By declining to chase the market, they've actually forced prices down in some areas, a rarity. Buyers now have the uupper hand in most of the country. They are showing their good sense in other ways too. Borrowing costs on homes are falling, and many homeowners are planning to refinance at lower rates. Again, it's a consumer's market: Banks are advertising for customers. Meanwhile, consumers have been strengthening their cash position. They have improved their savings; personal savings as a percentage of income in June rose to 5.9 percent from 5.4 percent in May and the total of $ 224.1 billion was the second highest ever. Personal income has been improving too. The improvement has n't been sharp but it has been healthy, especially since inflation has been relatively restrained Both, low inflation and rising income, reinforce higher savings. These and other factors, including an unusually strong employment situation, put the consumer in a strong position as the economy slows. In a sense, consumers are in a position to dictate in many areas of the economy. The situation is in stark contrast to conditions that prevailed in the 1970s, when the consumer was on the run. So desperate where buyers in that decade that they purchased in anticipation of price increases, and in so doing drove prices even higher. They were panicked, convinced that they could save by buying in advance of need. The situation today is reversed. Buyers are more inclined to sit and wait, convinced that waiting is the way to a better deal. They are patient rather than frantic. They are making the seller come to them. It is a rather rare situation, but it is one that might help to correct a slur on consumers _ that they are mere puppets manipulated by clever marketers. If they can hold their ground they might change some minds.

 <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> has been to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> a few times now, but the English director has n't stopped looking for <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> to appear whenever the clouds roll in. `` The first film I saw was ` Singing in the Rain,''' explained the 44-year-old director. `` What an introduction! I thought life was like that. When I'm in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, I still think that everybody goes to high school, everybody has a car, everybody's rich, everybody has wraparound teeth and everyone sings and dances so spontaneously.'' Hollywood musicals provided <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, a native of <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, with the perfect escape from his own unhappy life. The youngest of 10 children, his father was a violent man who terrorized the family. He died when <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> was 7. Over the years, his older siblings filled in details of their father's behavior. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> never forgot. `` When I was growing, I would get up and look at the house and go into the street and say, ` I must remember how it looks today.' I do n't know why, but I've got a very accurate visual and aural memory. I can remember conversations verbatim,'' he said. `` Distant Voices, Still Lives,'' his new film, represents just a fraction of those memories. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> recreates his childhood by showing the pain of a working class family in <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION> in the 1940s and'50s _ their hardship increased by a violent father. But like `` Singing in the Rain,'' or `` Meet Me in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' another favorite of <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, the characters of `` Distant Lives'' are sustained by music. At any time, someone is likely to break into song, maybe `` Bye-Bye Blackbird'' or `` Roll Out the Barrel.'' `` Pastoral Symphony'' and `` Hymn to the Virgin'' are heard in the film, too. `` The family would go to this pub and a few friends would be over and everyone would have a sing-song,'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said. `` They'd go back to the house and have another sing-song Everyone did it. `` I remember my sister was going to buy ` 10 Cents a Dance' from ` Love Me or Leave Me' -LRB- starring <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> -RRB-. I was agog for weeks on end. We were going to have <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> singing in our house!'' <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> new film shows how popular entertainment mixes with real life and how the lines get blurred. He recalled the bright smiles and lilting melodies of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> musicals enhancing the dim environment of his own city. `` When you came out of the cinema into the slums, you did n't think, ` Oh how we're terribly deprived. It transformed the way you looked at your life. You thought, ` Is n't it fabulous? Was n't Doris Day fabulous in that number?' You were on a high for three or four weeks. `` My sisters went all the time. I was absolutely thrilled with ` Meet Me in St. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>.' They lived on <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and we lived on <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. I was sure we were exactly alike. I was just sorry we did n't have <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ames </PERSON> as a father.'' He first wanted to act, appearing in amateur productions of `` Uncle Vanya,'' `` The Cherry Orchard'' and many other plays. In 1972, he went to Coventry Drama and stumbled upon a chance to direct. `` I had written a screenplay, ` Children,' which was the first part of the autobiographical trilogy that I made over a period of 10 years. No one would do it. `` But there was a series on televison called ` Cinema Now,' and it told how I could apply to the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for money. I sent a script in and a year later was asked to go to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> where I was told to direct.'' Life and fantasy again blurred. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, a complete novice at directing, was terrified on the set and remembered bitterly the crew's disrespectful treatment. Still, he fell in love with filmmaking. `` I realized when I looked down the camera the first time that this is what I wanted to do, even if I do it badly. You've captured a moment and there was magic between the filming of it and it actually taking place. It's still terribly exciting.'' By 1983, with the completion of `` <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and Child'' and `` Death and Transfiguration,'' the second and third parts of his trilogy, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> had learned his craft. Each shot for `` Distant Voices'' was planned before the start of filming, and he quickly cast <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Postlethwaite </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freda </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowie </PERSON> as his parents. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>' only concern was how his siblings would react to seeing their lives on screen. `` Their feelings were mixed,'' he said. `` It's opening up a lot of suffering, but they're also very proud I'm a film director and I go to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and have lunch at <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> -RRB-. I thought it was a homage to them, I did n't feel it was dirty laundry. They suffered so much I thought it had to be told.'' Still, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> is disappointed that directing has taken the magic out of his own movie-going experience. Reality has finally intruded on fantasy. `` As soon as you create something, you've lost your innocence. I miss going to the cinema and being absolutely transported by it. Now, I'm too critical.''

<HEAD>Quebec Separatist Issue Back in Canadian Politics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SOLL SUSSMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A public opinion poll has thrust the issue of Quebec independence back into the Canadian political arena, although Quebeckers rejected separatism in a referendum nearly a decade ago. The Gallup poll indicated that 28 percent of Canadians believe French-speaking <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> should become an independent country. According to Gallup, it was the strongest support for separatism nationally since the company's pollsters first asked the question more than 20 years ago. Perhaps the most startling finding of the poll of 1,034 Canadians was that 27 percent of English-speaking Canadians and 36 percent of French-speaking Canadians favored <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s becoming a separate nation. There long has been resentment in parts of English-speaking <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, especially in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, of what is perceived as favoritism or special treatment for Quebec. But the percentage of those who would just as soon see it separate from <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> had not been perceived to be as high as the poll indicated. Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, brushed the poll findings aside. `` The heartbeat of the nation is strong, it's vigorous and it's resolved to even greater unity,'' he said `` It's kind of silly to ask Canadians whether they want to divide their country or to strip their country. The answer, when you strip away the varnish, is absolutely ` no.''' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> conceded that some linguistic tensions exist in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> but said that always has been the case. Indeed, a focus in the Canadian news media on the national unity issue may be as much a result of a languid summer without much else attracting attention as to any concrete developments in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>. Premier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourassa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>, who opposes separatism, appears virtually certain to win the election expected in early fall, possibly with an even greater margin of victory for his provincial <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> than in 1985 when it won 99 of 122 seats in the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> legislature. The <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION>, which found success with its separatist message in the 1970s, has fallen on hard times, and the economic prosperity that has lasted in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> along with most of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> for seven years makes this an unlikely time for a comeback. Quebec, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s largest and second most populous province with 6.5 million people, is 81 percent French-speaking. No one is predicting a new surge of the separatist movement. The poll results were a reminder of how intractable the French-English issues are in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the difficulties of running a country in which nine provinces are majority English-speaking and one French-speaking. Among those expessing unease, however, was <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, the retiring leader of the naional <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which sits in opposition to <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Progressive Conservatives. `` I have, during the course of the last six or nine months, experienced and felt a deterioration in the mood of the country,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. `` I believe all those who share with me the view of a tolerant, bilingual federation working in equilibrium should be concerned.'' Quebec barely surfaced as an issue in the national election this past November when the big issue was the free trade agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s victory allowed the pact to take effect as scheduled Jan. 1, and <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> was a center of support for the agreement and its native son. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s Progressive Conservatives do not run in <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s provincial elections. But the <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> government's refusal last winter to remove its restrictions on bilingual signs despite a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> decision touched off resentment among the province's English minority and in English-speaking provinces. French is required throughout <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> as the only language on most outdoor signs. There also has been growing realization that the <ORGANIZATION> Meech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accord </ORGANIZATION>, a constitutional agreement recognizing <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> as a `` distinct society,'' may not make its deadline on June 23 for ratification by all 10 provinces. The <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast province of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Manitoba </LOCATION> in the West have yet to ratify the agreement, and threats have been made to reconsider ratification elsewhere before the deadline. The Meech Lake Accord developed because <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> had refused to join the nine other provinces in signing the national constitution at the outset of the decade. The constitution still applies to <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> even without its signature, but the impasse makes it more difficult for changes to be made on such national issues as native rights and the way the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> operates. <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> voters rejected sovereignty in a 1980 referendum after a dizzying decade in which power shifted from the English minority to the French majority. The <LOCATION> Parti </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quebecois </LOCATION> governed the province from 1976 to 1985 but lost its spirit after 60 percent of <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION>'s voters in the 1980 referendum rejected separation.

<HEAD>East Germans Fleeing to the West in Record Numbers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A sense of hopelessness has driven a record number of East Germans across newly porous borders to the West this year. Private and government agencies who help resettle refugees say they expect about 100,000 East Germans to make it to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by the end of the year. The number of despairing East Germans climbing, crawling and catapulting their way across the border has swelled to a rate unparalleled since the flood of escapees 30 years ago. That exodus was dammed by the construction of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> on Aug. 13, 1961. And those braving the heavily fortified borders are now joined by a new breed of escapees who obtain legal permission to travel abroad then refuse to return. `` It is a sense that grows stronger each day among East Germans that they have no hope, no perspectives for better days as long as the current regime is in power,'' said <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON>, director of the August 13th Society that aids East German refugees. `` The fact that 50 percent of those escaping now are under the age of 24 is testimony to the general despair felt there.'' About 10,000 East Germans with legal tourist visas have sought asylum in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> so far this year, and at least 70,000 legal emigres are expected by the end of the year. A West German official who spoke on condition of anonymity said at least 200 East Germans are seeking asylum at West German embassies in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` We advise against this method as there are continuing dangers involved, and there is simply no way to accommodate people at the representations,'' the official said. In <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where an estimated 130 East Germans are seeking refugee status and access to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, authorities have hinted that they may recognize a right to asylum, but no decisions have been made. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s deputy minister for Inter-German Relations, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Priesnitz </PERSON>, said recently that East Germans should not try to leave without proper documents through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which also has a communist government. In the course of democratic reform, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has dismantled nearly half of the 160-mile barbed-wire border separating it from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Officials in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> have been approached for help by 237 East Germans who fled across the border since the Hungarians began dismantling the barbed wire in May. But they estimate up to six times that number have gone directly to the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> after arriving via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Toth </PERSON>, the Hungarian <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official responsible for refugee affairs, has said a special refugee camp will be erected in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> for those seeking asylum. But until then, those seeking refuge at the West German Embassy now may be forced to return to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Detlef </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter-German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the West German government advises East Germans to seek legal means of emigrating, but he acknowledged that the majority of applicants must wait years. `` It is hopelessness that is driving so many here,'' <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON> said. `` There are no limits on the number of East Germans that we will take in. But we have no interest in depopulating <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.'' One East Berliner, who did not want his name used, said East Germans are turning to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as an escape route because the prospects for reform in their own nation seem ever dimmer as <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> remains the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. `` <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> is apparently a very healthy man, and as long as he is alive we will have the status quo,'' he said. `` But right now we have a terrible situation because nobody knows what the reality is. It is naivete and wishful thinking that makes people seek help in another socialist country.'' East German officials declined the discuss the isssue. `` These matters remain very sensitive, as you know,'' said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Thost </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> who deals with press relations. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> has told visiting West German officials his government has repealed long-standing orders to shoot those trying to escape, except in cases where other lives are threatened. No shootings have been reported since February despite a rising rate of escapes. The August 13th Society calculates that at least 189 East Germans were killed in failed escape attempts since the Berlin Wall was built. At least 350 escapes have been recorded this year up to mid-July over the wall and across the heavily fortified borders with the rest of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Philippines Land Reform Program Bogged Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARO CORTES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Once hailed as the showpiece of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government, the land reform program is so bogged down in corruption and red tape and crippled by loopholes that even the official responsible for it wants to change it. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> signed the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law in June, 1988, to redistribute land to nearly 4 million peasants and free rural Filipinos from what she called `` their ancient poverty.'' Land reform was widely hailed as essential to defeat the 20-year-old communist insurgency in the countryside and break the grip on power enjoyed by powerful landlords. Last year, the government distributed 150,000 land titles covering some 254,000 acres. Most of the titles were awarded to rice and corn farmers, making the effort merely an extension of the land reform program decreed by ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' program covered only corn and rice-producing lands but the Aquino plan encompasses all crop holdings. Critics claim the new law is so flawed that it stands little chance of achieving its goals and of being more successful than the dozen previous attempts at land reform since the 1930s. Under the program, expected to cost $ 10 billion, the government will pay landlords for their land. Those who then take possession must repay the government over 30 years at 6 percent annual interest. Militant farmer groups claim few can afford to repay and have proposed that peasants pay half a sack of rice per hectare -LRB- 2.47 acres -RRB- a year for three decades. Most critics also cite loopholes favoring landlords. Landowners can retain five hectares -LRB- 12.3 acres -RRB- plus three hectares -LRB- 7.4 acres -RRB- for each direct heir over age 15. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agrarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> acknowledges that it is uncertain how much of the 24 million acres of agricultural land has effectively been removed from the program by exemptions. Under the program, estates of more than 50 hectares -LRB- 123.5 acres -RRB- are to remain untouched until 1992. The program also gives landowners the option of establishing profit-sharing plans for workers in lieu of transferring titles. Among those who opted for this alternative was Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s family, the Cojuangcos, who established a stock plan for workers on their 12,350-acre sugarcane estate in central <LOCATION> Luzon </LOCATION> A review committee suspended the implementation of the profit sharing scheme after critics claimed Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s family grossly undervalued their property. `` If land reform means to set the peasant free from the political and economic domination of the landlord which is the essence of a genuine agricultural reform program then, on the whole, it failed to break land monopoly,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Tadeo </PERSON>, leader of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>. `` What it gave were just crumbs, a few leftovers.'' In an attempt to get more large estates for redistribution before 1992, the government offered landlords the option of selling their property now. But in several cases, the government paid far more for the land than it was found to be worth, triggering allegations of corruption. The most controversial case involved the proposed purchase of 4,666 acres in <LOCATION> Camarines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION> province for the peso equivalent of $ 2.9 million. The sale was blocked when investigators found the land was worth only about $ 143,000. `` Those scandals have given more ammunition to those attacking the program,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edsel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lagman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>' agrarian reform committee. `` Those supporting it are now wavering and the skeptical are slowly joining those who have been opposing it.'' The scandal led to the resignation of <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Juico </PERSON> as the agrarian reform secretary and suspension of a voluntary sales program pending a review of the more than 700 sale offers. <PERSON> Juico </PERSON> was replaced by Immigration Chairman <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Defensor </PERSON> <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON>, who recently told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> committee that the current law is `` a hodge-podge full of inconsistencies'' and should be amended. She said the provisions for establishing `` just compensation'' for landowners was too complicated and that the reform aspects of the program had been `` watered-down'' by landlord blocs in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Santiago </PERSON> also said the government lacks the money to purchase lands under the current system. The government had hoped to finance the program in part through the sale of assets recovered from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates. But so far, that effort has generated only $ 340 million. About $ 140 million in foreign aid is also available for land reform. Problems in the land reform program have given the rebel <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> a propaganda coup. It has announced its own `` land reform'' program in which it distributes to supporters property seized from landlords. The government estimates indicate the rebels have seized more than 76,500 acres nationwide, but rebel spokesmen claim to have handed out 111,000 acres in the central Visayas islands alone.

<HEAD>Soviet A.A. Termed ``Reconstruction of the Soul.'' ^With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As head of the first Soviet office promulgating the tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous, <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzmicheva </PERSON> says the approach makes for `` reconstruction of the soul.'' `` It offers not just recovery from alcoholism, but a program of spiritual recovery,'' she says. `` It brings out a completely new personality.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kuzmicheva </PERSON>, an attractive blonde Russian of 38 and coordinator of the newly opened <ORGANIZATION> Soviet-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, says the A.A. technique is being found as effective there as in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. After all, `` we are human beings, all of us,'' she said in an interview. `` Due to the changes being made in our country, we also have been able to acquire the movement.'' Among participants, she said, believers `` speak of God'' helping them overcome their addiction. `` Others speak of a higher power. They all recognize they need a higher power exerted to help them. `` As to what kind, they need time to understand it is God.'' Such religious terminology may seem unusual for a health-promoting agency in an officially atheist society, but millions of people there are devout believers. However, <PERSON> A.A. </PERSON> itself steers clear of overtly religious affirmations or criteria, acknowledging only that help of a `` higher power'' is essential in overcoming alcoholism, but leaving that aspect undefined. Individuals may interpret that power as the group and its mutually supportive associations, or may consider it the Judeo-Christian God who acts in human affairs, or both. Whichever involves a spiritual dimension. It is purposely kept vague, so as to take in all comers. `` God as you understand him,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kuzmicheva </PERSON> puts it, using a typical AA phrase, meaning that the power is whatever recovering alcoholics consider it. `` They had lost control over themselves and lost the very quality of being human when they drank,'' she said. `` When they see life with sober eyes, miracles happen in their lives. They grow spiritually. `` They regain their best spiritual selves.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kuzmicheva </PERSON>, a professional educator who served as a factory personnel director before taking the post at the new <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> center, recently completed a month-long <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour with three Soviet A.A. members. Accompanying them was the Rev. J.W. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Episcopal </LOCATION> priest who had established the new Soviet center, and who in 1987 had started the Soviet's first <LOCATION> A.A. </LOCATION> group called <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Beginners. He says Soviet authorities initially were dubious of the project, but their attitude has changed to `` cautious respect'' now that they are `` seeing alcoholics get a second chance at life.'' On the 16-city tour concluded in late June, the group had addressed school and church gatherings, met with numerous <LOCATION> A.A. </LOCATION> groups, usually in churches, but also with an atheist-agnostic <ORGANIZATION> A.A. </ORGANIZATION> group in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They also toured various health facilities and met with former Presidents <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and their wives, attending a Sunday school class taught by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> in his hometown of <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Kuzmicheva </PERSON> said the Scripture lesson, as <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> interpreted it, emphasized that when <PERSON> God </PERSON> gives his promises, they sooner or later are fulfilled `` This is very promising for our country,'' she said, adding that recent liberalizing developments there pointed toward a more fulfilling future. However, like <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the Soviet has immense problems with alcoholism. Soviet leader <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in 1985 launched a campaign against it, but popular resistance forced him to ease some of the restrictions. `` Unfortunately the problem is very acute in our country,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kuzmicheva </PERSON> said, estimating there are 10 to 15 million alcoholics in a population of 290 million. `` We have seen how strong and spiritual the A.A. movement is in this country and we hope to have the same success in our country,'' she said. `` It will work. It will work all over the world.'' On the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour, the Soviet A.A. members often gave their testimony in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> meetings, using only first names as customary in A.A. Two of them were atheists, one of them a believer. They told of families breaking up, being repeatedly hospitalized, but not being able to quit drinking until admitting they could n't without help of a higher power. <PERSON> Saha </PERSON>, 43, an engineer and a non-believer puts it this way: `` With alcoholism, you have to admit despair before you experience victory.'' Ms. <PERSON> Kuzmicheva </PERSON>, not an alcoholic herself, says she is a believer, but not a regular church-goer. `` Many did not believe in God when they drank, but when they become sober, they begin to believe.

<HEAD>Ford Ranger Changes from Work to Play</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto and LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A funny thing happened to the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION> on its way to becoming <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s compact pickup truck leader. It went from being a work truck to being a personal vehicle. The change was more than just semantics. It went below the sheet metal. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> increased the Ranger's horsepower, jazzed up the outside with two-tone paint and made the interior more car-like as the Ranger evolved over the decade and its sales rose to more than 300,000 a year. Today's 1989 Ford Ranger reaps the benefits of all the changes, with the automaker projecting at the close of the 1989 model year that the <ORGANIZATION> Ranger </ORGANIZATION> will retain its title as the top-selling compact pickup. The test vehicle was a 1989 Ranger XLT two-wheel-drive, the most popular Ranger model because it offers a number of optional features in one low-priced package. The XLT had such amenities as power steering, deluxe two-tone paint, a rear window that slides open and AM @ FM stereo cassette player with clock. Price out the door was $ 10,464. The test truck felt sturdy _ like a truck _ and easily maneuverable _ like a car. Its high profile offered a good view of traffic ahead, and its cloth bench seats with center armrest and easy-to-read instrument panel made for a comfortable interior. I did feel the jostling, shuddering of a truck-like suspension over big bumps but it was n't overly bothersome. There also was truck-like road noise. The all-terrain tires and rear antilock brakes gave surefooted confidence. The five-speed manual transmission was a bit notchy in its feel but it and the new-for -'89 four-cylinder engine with eight spark plugs performed <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> boosted the horsepower 10 percent this model year to 100 with the 2.3-iter, Twin Plug engine design that uses two spark plugs per cylinder. It helped give the Ranger a more peppy ride and more power for trailer towing. Fuel economy was commendable, with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> rating at 23 mpg in the city and 27 mpg on the highway. I would n't advise trying to seat three across in the Ranger XLT regular cab. The middle person would either have the gear shifter between the legs or would have to sit sideways with the legs dangling over to the other passenger's area. This year <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> added a column-mounted automatic transmission shift lever to help solve this problem. If you get the manual transmission and carry only two people in the regular cab as I did, the legroom seems decent and seating is adequate. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> also offers a Super Cab that has the largest rear seating package in the compact pickup truck segment. Length of the test Ranger pickup box was 76.3 inches, bringing total vehicle length to 175.6 inches. While that's considerably shorter than the more than 194 inches of overall length of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> F-150 full-size pickups, it's still sufficient room for hauling wood, furniture and the lawn mower, if the occasion arises. Men between 30 and 35 years of age are 85 percent of the Ranger buyers and they use the little pickup mostly for personal use, such as driving to work, according to <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Stajich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Division compact truck marketing plans manager. Sixty-five percent are married, but most do not have children. Many Ranger buyers are first-time truck buyers, he said, adding that two-thirds either trade in cars as they buy the Ranger or had a car as an alternative purchase. He called them middle of the roaders who are educated with somewhat upscale, contemporary lifestyles but are more entry-level in their purchases. `` They're looking for a good deal, a low purchase price,'' <PERSON> Stajich </PERSON> said. `` ... And they can customize -LRB- the Ranger -RRB-. It has high flexibility.'' He noted that when the Ranger first came out in 1981 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> saw the truck as something that would offer value to more traditional truck buyers _ older, married men who would want to get better fuel economy from their trucks. `` That was true for the first year,'' <PERSON> Stajich </PERSON> said. `` Then Toyota led the way, adding youthful appeal to their trucks ... In 1987, we revamped our marketing and made the Ranger sportier.'' Base price of $ 9,001 for the test Ranger is not the lowest among compact pickup trucks. A similar Chevrolet S10, for example, starts below $ 9,000. But <PERSON> Stajich </PERSON> said many of the features offered in the XLT package are separate options on other small pickups, such as those offered by <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, and thus could add up to a more expensive final price. Consumer Reports magazine rates the Ford Ranger two-wheel-drive with four-ylinder engine as average in its reports of trouble from owners of 1983-87 models.

 Each day, <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> wages a frustrating and sometimes futile battle to save the innocent victims of drug abuse and poor prenatal care. `` When you lose a child there's a feeling of defeat,'' says <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who as head of obstetrics at <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> is confronted by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s infant mortality rate, the worst in the nation. `` You've had every hope of saving this person and you suddenly feel hopeless.'' In the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, eight babies lie fighting for their lives. One is just 15 days old. He tests positive for the AIDS virus and has syphilis. His body is not producing red blood cells properly, causing his stomach to bloat. White swatches of cloth are bound around his tiny ankles, holding down his legs to keep him from hurting himself. He suffers from what doctors here call `` tremblisness.'' Adult drug addicts call it the shakes. At just two weeks of age, this unnamed baby is going through withrawal. His mother is a cocaine addict. Her name and whereabouts are unknown. Hospital officials do not expect her to return to claim the child. To varying degrees, this picture is repeated at urban hospitals across the country, hampering efforts to reduce a national infant mortality rate that already lags behind <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and most of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Each year, about 40,000 American babies die before their first birthday, for a national rate last year of 9.9 deaths per 1,000 births. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s rate of 23.2 per 1,000 births was more than double the already distressing national figure, substantially above the world average for developed nations of about 17, and far worse than rates for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, for example, the rate is 9.1 per 1,000 births; in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, 8.3; in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, 7.6; in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, 5.7; and in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 4.9. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s large black population is afflicted in particular with high infant mortality. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> says black infants nationwide are nearly four times more likely to die as a result of prematurity and low birthweight. Many of these babies suffer from seizures due to brain damage, cerebral hemmorhage, increased heart rate and stunted organ growth. Most of the 244 infants who died in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> last year were born to drug-addicted mothers, many of whom sought no prenatal health care at all, says <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON>, the city's health commissioner Under such circumstances, officials say, there is frequently little that doctors such as <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> can do. `` The reality is as tragic as we predicted,'' <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON> says. Prenatal care in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> costs an estimated $ 400 per mother, but the lifetime costs of caring for low birthweight infants can easily run into the tens of thousands of dollars, <PERSON> Tuckson </PERSON> says. `` If you went to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> or to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, you would see the same phenomenon,'' says <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, chairman of the neonatology department at D.C. General. `` Other cities say between 10 and 15 percent of babies there are born to drug addicted mothers.'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> says one pregnant woman he encountered went into labor prematurely while snorting or smoking cocaine, which can cause the uterus to contract and cut off oxygen to the baby. Of the children who do survive, many are abandoned. Hospital officials have termed them `` boarder'' babies. D.C. General had 11 boarder babies last month. They remain at the hospital an average of 124 days before they are adopted or placed in foster care. The cost to the hospital for boarder babies last year was $ 500,662, officials say. A commission of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> thinks a national plan to combat infant mortality may be one answer to the problem. `` Thirty years ago, we as a nation made a commitment to to care for the elderly,'' said <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Grad </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to Prevent Infant Mortality. `` The elderly can get Medicare and Social Security. We are saying that we as a nation have not made a commitment to children.''

 When cable TV pioneer and movie buff <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> bought the MGM movie library three years ago, he got `` The Wizard of Oz'' _ but he ca n't show it on his own stations until 1999. Under an agreement hammered out at the time of the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> purchase, the <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> gave up television rights to `` The Wizard of Oz,'' but obtained the rights to another classic, `` Gone With the Wind,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s favorite film. <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rhett </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> thus left <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> for <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Toto </PERSON> set up camp with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, which first showed `` The Wizard of Oz'' to television viewers on the night of Nov. 3, 1956. `` What happened was, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> traded,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicol </PERSON> of TBS. `` We had the TV rights to ` The Wizard of Oz,'' but <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> really wanted ` Gone With the Wind.''' Even though <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> ca n't show ` Oz' on its TBS SuperStation or on <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> _ <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, its feature entertainment channel _ that has n't stopped <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and his companies from marking the film's 50th anniversary. Under license from <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>, MGM-UA Home Video will release its `` Golden 50th Anniversary Collector's Edition'' videocassette of `` Oz,'' complete with a `` commemorative videotape package.'' Fancy packaging aside, the new version is being touted as a videophile's delight _ fully restored, and with two added sequences: a dance reprise of `` If I Only Had a Brain,'' performed by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolger </PERSON> as the Scarecrow, and another musical number, `` The Jitterbug.'' Both were cut from the film during editing. Missing from the home video version are the familiar black-and-white <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> sequences, before <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> crashes into Oz; that's because they are n't really supposed to be black and white. The film's first moments were originally filmed in sepia and white, for a softer transition to the Technicolor splendor of Oz. Later prints opted for the simpler black-and-white technique. `` It's a beautifully restored print, with the original Technicolor at its best,'' said TBS' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` And with the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> sequences, in the original sepia tone ... it's really beautiful.'' It's not as if the old videocassette did badly; released in 1980, it's sold 600,000 copies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the new videocassette, <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> also is releasing the restored film for special screenings in theaters across the country, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. A new release of the score is coming out on compact disc, including a recording <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON> made during his nine days as the <PERSON> Tin </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodman </PERSON>. According to `` Oz'' film chronicler <PERSON> Aljean </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmetz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ebsen </PERSON> suffered a debilitating allergic reaction to the aluminum dust the costumers dumped all over him and was hospitalized, leading to his replacement with <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>. And if seeing the movie and hearing the score are n't enough, `` Oz'' fans, under a `` worldwide licensing program'' of Turner Home Entertainment, can buy an oz-tentatious array of stuff: There's Oz clothing for the whole family, including maternity wear. Ties. Jewelry. Costumes of the Scarecrow, the Cowardly Lion and other characters. Greeting cards. Postcards. Buttons. Key chains. Calendars. `` Bendable toys.'' Giftwrap. Lunch boxes. Beach towels. All are for sale in `` The Turner Store,'' a souvenir stand in the lobby of <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s CNN Center building in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Also available: `` dental reminder cards,'' to send cowardly patients off to see the dentist _ which for some, can be as big an adventure as going off to see the Wizard.

<HEAD>`Bordertown' Filmed in Authentic Replica of Western Town</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Comar </PERSON> says the set built for `` Bordertown'' is so authentic a cowboy from the Old West could ride in and feel at home. An entire town was built on a ranch east of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, for the half-hour weekly Western series on the Family Channel. Sixty-five carpenters worked 5 -LCB- weeks to build the half-million dollar town. `` Every building is complete inside and out,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Comar </ORGANIZATION>, who stars as <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>. `` We film everything there, with no studio work at all. In the winter the streets are muddy. The prop people came in and _ in the general store, for instance _ they stocked every shelf and drawer. If you open the lace drawer there's lace in it. The saloon has antique bottles. The livery stable has period tack, and the saddles are a hundred years old.'' The show is set in a town that straddles the U.S.-Canadian border. <ORGANIZATION> Comar </ORGANIZATION> plays a gunfighter-turned-marshal, while <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> is <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, a Canadian Mountie who goes strictly by the book. French actress <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Barjac </PERSON> also co-stars as the town doctor. It is a joint Canadian-French production that will also be shown in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Comar </ORGANIZATION> said he compares <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> street cop and <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> bobby. <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON> is a functioning illiterate who is a pack rat and is terribly disorganized. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is very organized and a member of a semi-military organization. They have a bit of an `` Odd Couple'' relationship. `` The authentic town and props help us get the feeling of what the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was like,'' <ORGANIZATION> Comar </ORGANIZATION> said on a visit here. He was attired in his costume: chaps, a handmade gun belt, and a heavy-duty cotton shirt with a bib front that can be taken off when it gets dirty. `` <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>'s looking for a soft place to retire. He's a former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Ranger. He worked on a ranch near <LOCATION> Laredo </LOCATION> and killed a Mexican rancher's son while stealing horses in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. In retaliation they killed his son and daughter. That's when he went to <LOCATION> Bordertown </LOCATION> to ease the pain.'' The Western series has made a small comeback on the networks, which have two shows this year, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Paradise'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Young Riders.'' But the Western is thriving on the Family Channel. In addition to `` Bordertown,'' the cable network as `` Gunsmoke,'' `` Wagon Train,'' `` Bonanza: The Lost Episodes,'' `` The Big Valley'' and `` The Rifleman.'' On Saturdays and Sundays, the Westerns start at 11:30 a.m. EDT with `` <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>.'' The Family Channel has also ordered a new version of `` Zorro,'' to be made in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` They're considering a two-hour ` Bordertown' movie,'' <ORGANIZATION> Comar </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It would be the pilot we never made. It would be great to get a superior story and to be able to flesh it out. `` We sometimes have a guest villain on the show, but we try to concentrate on human relations. The things that are happening in the town. People get tired of violence, so the jeopardy caused by the bad guys is secondary. We've also had stories about real people. In one show <PERSON> Bat </PERSON> <PERSON> Masterson </PERSON> came to town trailing four men. In another, President <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON>'s life is threatened when he comes to town. He's assassinated elsewhere, however.'' <ORGANIZATION> Comar </ORGANIZATION> is a former stage manager and lighting director for rock groups and ballet companies. He lived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for two years and worked there off and on for six to eight years. During time off from `` Bordertown'' he went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> to co-star with <PERSON> Susanna </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON> in an episode of `` The Ray Bradbury Theater.'' Last summer, he played a television executive in the Home Box Office miniseries `` Glory, Glory.'' He was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> miniseries `` Echoes in The Darkness,'' and had roles is the movies `` Switching Channels,'' `` Short Circuit II'' and `` Big Town.'' `` My wife, <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>, and I moved to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> a year ago but we've only spent three months in our house,'' he said. `` I've been working in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. We're expecting our first child on Labor Day.'' <ORGANIZATION> Comar </ORGANIZATION> said when he auditioned for `` Bordertown'' it was for the role of the mountie. `` I'm well-educated, I'm neat, I hate guns,'' he said. `` I'm the complete opposite of <PERSON> Craddock </PERSON>. My wife hates it that I do n't shave for five months. She does n't mind the long hair.''

 Mergers and acquisitions in the field of computer software and services slowed sharply in the first half of 1989, an investment banking firm said.

 British investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is still thriving, according to a study released amid renewed international pressure on athletes and businesses to protest apartheid. More than 200 British companies have subsidiaries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, despite substantial disinvestment in the past three years to protest the government's rigid policies of racial separation, says the report released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The 20 largest of these companies employ a total of 230,000 people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, according to the department, a leftist trade union research organization. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government opposes mandatory economic sanctions, saying they would hurt the majority black population and neighboring black states more than <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white governing minority But a group of foreign ministers from the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> agreed Tuesday to recommend the 48-nation organization of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and its former colonies adopt a new package of financial sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The ministers also condemned renewed sporting contacts with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> which threaten the 1990 Commonwealth Games in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. Sixteen English cricket players have accepted invitations to play in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in the next two years, and Australian and British rugby players have been asked to compete there later this month. According to the investment report, the biggest British interest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is the diversified mining company <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which has a 38 percent stake in Gold Fields of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The gold and coal mining concern employs more than 102,000 workers. However, <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Monday it had completed a takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> and has said it will sell the mining company's South African interests. That would leave <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> in top place with a 38 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> AECI </ORGANIZATION>, the South African chemicals company which employs 26,500 workers, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Lonrho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> ranks third, with interests in platinum, coal and gold mines, employing 9,428 workers. The report said <ORGANIZATION> Lonrho </ORGANIZATION> apparently has twice ignored voluntary <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> codes which seek to prevent new investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Since 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Lonrho </ORGANIZATION> has raised its stake in <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platinum </ORGANIZATION> from 50 to 99 percent and revealed its 100 percent ownership of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Platinum </ORGANIZATION>. Other major British employers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> include <ORGANIZATION> Trafalgar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Unilever </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pilkington </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> BOC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BTR </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> RTZ </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schweppes </ORGANIZATION>, the report states. <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> recently joined the list by acquiring <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, which, the report says, profits from international sanctions by manufacturing car engines that are no longer built locally because other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and British car makers have left. Several major British companies have pulled out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in recent years, the report says, including the two big banks, <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chartered </ORGANIZATION>, the packaging firm <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION>, cable company <ORGANIZATION> BICC </ORGANIZATION> and engineering firms <ORGANIZATION> IMI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Glynwed </ORGANIZATION>. The Anti-Apartheid Movement estimates total direct and indirect investment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by British companies was about $ 10.24 billion, down from about $ 12.6 billion in 1987. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s third-largest trading partner behind <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Tuesday's report says the disinvestment campaign has had more success in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> than in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in part because municipal and educational bodies have threatened to cancel large contracts if companies did not sever their South African ties.

 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday announced a three-week extension of its $ 110-per-share cash offer for all shares of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s action came more than a week after a LIN-imposed deadline for a negotiated buyout pact passed without agreement LIN, a New York-based cellular telephone, television, broadcasting and publishing concern, said on July 31, its deadline, that its board would pursue other options. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>'s outstanding hostile tender offer of $ 110 per share for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> stock it does n't already own had been scheduled to expire at midnight EDT Friday. It will now expire at midnight EDT Sept. 1, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said. About 1.07 million LIN shares have been tendered, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said Tuesday. LIN has said the $ 110 offer is inadequate. There was no immediate comment from LIN about the McCaw extension. The two companies said in mid-July they were talking about a possible buyout at $ 127.50 a share. But Kirkland-based <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> said July 21 it had suspended those talks pending further review. After that, LIN set a July 31 deadline for reaching a definite agreement under which <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> would acquire <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> stock for $ 127.50 a share, an offer that would value LIN's 53.9 million shares at nearly $ 6.9 billion.

 Industry analysts and Wall Street welcomed the decision by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> to resign as president of the troubled computer company founded by his father. Share prices in <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 20 percent after the announcement Tuesday. Analysts said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s resignation signaled the Lowell-based company's intention to get serious about its problems, which include a recently announced $ 375 million quarterly loss. `` Like a general who lost a battle, he accepted responsibility and it will have a beneficial effect on Wall Street,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Geran </PERSON>, a computer analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The stock rose to $ 6.87 -LCB- a share from $ 5.75 on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Still, some analysts said the company will have trouble finding a strong, independent manager to lead it out of its troubles as long as <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, the company's 69-year-old founder and chairman, continues to exert control. `` A good aggressive executive does n't want to be No. 2,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The 11-member board of directors assembled for a special meeting Monday night at <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> headquarters and the younger <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> resigned as president and chief operating officer. The board named as acting president <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> H.S </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chou </PERSON>, currently a vice chairman and director of the international computer maker. A search committee for a new president was formed. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, 38, is a computer mathematician who worked in the family business for 17 years. He was elevated to the presidency in 1986. `` There is a general perception that -LRB- <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> -RRB- was in over his head. But he was dealing with basic change in the minicomputer business,'' <PERSON> Geran </PERSON> said. `` I believe this action is in the best interest of <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> at this time,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Employees and customers will be best served by a speedy resolution to the company's current situation.'' <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, in a statement, called his son's resignation `` in keeping with his constant devotion to doing what he felt was in the best interest of the company.'' In November 1986, the elder <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> stepped down as president and was replaced by his son but retained the job of chief executive officer. The day his son resigned, <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> had returned to work part-time after recovering from surgery for cancer of the esophagus. The younger <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> will remain on the board and undertake special projects. Prospects for the company `` depend on the health of the doctor,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, referring to the elder <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, who holds a doctorate from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> in computer science and often is called by that title. `` If the doctor's healthy, they'll bring in a president and they'll try to resurrect themselves.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Wangs </ORGANIZATION> hold a controlling interest in the company and have resisted any suggestion they sell it, preferring instead to try to get the business back on its feet. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said stockholders would benefit most if the company were sold or, at the very least, if <PERSON> An </PERSON> <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> stepped out of the way. Last week, the company announced a $ 375 million quarterly loss and said it it suspended dividend payments. Its financial predicament put it in violation of a bank-lending agreement, the company noted. Most of the quarterly loss resulted from a $ 237 million pre-tax charge to cover the cost of a restructuring that involved closing factories, cutting jobs in its worldwide work force of 28,000 people, and lowering the book value of outdated assets. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> stock has lost more than 80 percent of its value since early 1984, when it traded at more than $ 35 a share. Founded in 1951, the company made its reputation in the 1970s in office word processors. But sales began to slip with the increasing popularity of personal computers. Its minicomputer business fell behind as well, eclipsed by workstations. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Henning </PERSON>, a Wang spokesman, said Tuesday of the resignation, `` We wanted to give a consistent message that we are doing everything and anything possible, even taking steps that are painful,'' he said. `` We have a lot of work to do,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have lived 14 miles from town and a mile apart since their teen-agers were babies. They've been together through diapers, drought and dark times in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Now the two farm women have teamed up to sell popcorn to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, ginseng to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, taco sauce to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, hash browns to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and oat bran to Wal-mart. They are the guiding force behind <LOCATION> AMTEX </LOCATION>, a homegrown marketing firm representing small to mid-sized Midwestern companies that mostly produce so-called value-added foods. In 1980 Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, now 44, was a country girl who planted her peas and lettuce to suit her aesthetic sense, dabbled at art, and exchanged dishrags with neighbor women at a monthly coffee klatch. Her husband, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, farmed 2,000 acres with one hired hand and brought in $ 750,000 worth of crops. But by 1986, when <ORGANIZATION> AMTEX </ORGANIZATION> was founded by <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> and some other farmers and businessmen, the farm crisis had forced the Dolans to buy back their home on the courthouse steps. Most of the machinery was gone. So was the hired man. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> was starting over on the land, and <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> became, without intending to or knowing how, a fledgling entrepreneur. A couple of months after AMTEX started, its office manager quit `` and I was drafted to ` make this thing work!' because I was the only unemployed wife,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. `` I came in here with no accounts and empty files. I could n't run the typewriter, I could n't understand the concept Every night I'd leave here crying. I had no idea what I was supposed to do. Sell soybeans to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>? Impossible!'' Today AMTEX represents 41 companies and is aggressively looking for more. Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 37, who `` volunteered to help <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> get caught up and then we never did,'' say they still have n't made any money. But they agree that every day they go to work they feel as if they'll land a big contract. `` Enthusiasm is the key to this. We're opportunistic, we're tenacious,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> `` We keep reminding ourselves we sold oat bran cereal to Wal-mart. If we did it once, we can do it again.'' It was their first big sale, full of hilarious foul-ups and tough lessons. `` I wrote <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> -LRB- founder of Wal-mart -RRB- a letter and told him about <LOCATION> AMTEX </LOCATION>, then months went by. One day I got a collect call from the head food buyer, who wanted us to come to <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, Ark. -LRB- Wal-mart headquarters -RRB-, and show him our products. I told him I'd have to call him back because neither of us had ever driven through <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Laughing hard at the memory, Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said: `` I panicked and told <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON>, ` Oh, no, I can only drive to the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, I ca n't cross it.' It was like a phobia. Neither one of us had ever, ever driven in freeway traffic.'' But after giving each other pep talks, they called Wal-mart buyer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> back and said they'd come. `` We drove through <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> white-knuckle all the way, sick at our stomachs, convinced we would die on the freeway,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> said. `` Then we just knew we'd never find <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Then we were afraid we'd never find <ORGANIZATION> Wal-mart </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION>, which is ludicrous looking back on it, because it's as big as the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'' Buyer <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, now working in another <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> division, remembers them as `` pretty sharp, open-minded and professional. I was impressed with them from the beginning.'' It took 18 months to close the deal, said Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, `` and in that time there was a worldwide oats shortage, not enough cardboard to make the cereal boxes, the original oat bran maker was bought by another company, and <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> was transferred.'' Along the way, the women got to know every restaurant in <LOCATION> Bentonville </LOCATION> and just about every <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> receptionist. `` Some days this job makes us crazy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, `` and other days it feeds our souls.'' Every letter AMTEX sends begins `` Good Day from <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>!'' Correspondence wings its way from a 10-by-12 foot cubicle on Main Street in this town of 7,000 to countries all over the world, as well as hundreds of potential domestic clients. `` In return we get letters that begin ` An Exceedingly Good Day from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>,''' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. `` It's a thrill because we do n't send three-paragraph corporate letters, we extend a hand in friendship and offer barbecue sauce on the side. `` When we get an overseas call we tell'em right off that we're just two farm women in a small office and we're just getting started, so do n't expect a huge staff with BMAs from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, or whatever those fancy degrees are. Added Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>: `` Somebody in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wanted an AMTEX flow chart. I went home and asked my husband, ` Honey, what's a flow chart?''' They may not know the jargon, but they put in 10-hour days trying to market foods such as smoked meats, bee pollen, popcorn, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> wine and stone-ground flour, as well as homemade lawn furniture and firewood. From the beginning, <ORGANIZATION> AMTEX </ORGANIZATION> sought help from the <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign service branch, which publishes descriptions of American products available for export `` We operate on a shoestring, so we've become aggressive guerrilla marketers,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, explaining they use a network of government services to make contacts. The two friends and co-workers also have become experts in minutiae, trivia and exotica. `` We got a call from <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> asking us if we had Boletus edilus,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. `` Neither of us had the vaguest idea what that was, but we thought it might be a plant. We went home, found out in the encyclopedia it was a dried mushroom, tracked some down in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and put the supplier and the buyer together by Telex.'' They also know where to find war-risk insurance, how to get labeling in Arabic and which freight forwarders are most efficient in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. Their jobs have changed them and opened new vistas in lives once focused almost exclusively on home and family. `` Joy used to make wedding gowns and I used to watch the birds feed,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. `` AMTEX is my canvas. I talk about nurturing it the same way I used to talk about raising my boys. This is everything I never thought I'd do.''

<HEAD>Government Reports Consumer Debt Rose at Slower Pace in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans took out $ 2.99 billion more in consumer debt than they retired in June, the government reported, as the pace of borrowing slowed in part because of declining auto sales. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that consumer credit in June rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.1 percent, down from May's revised 7.3 percent rate. The May increase was revised from $ 3.6 billion to $ 4.2 billion. Consumer credit increased 4.3 percent in April after rising 6.6 percent in March and 9.5 percent in February. Consumer credit increased 8.5 percent over all of 1988. Consumer spending is watched closely as a barometer of the economy's health since it represents two-thirds of overall economic activity. Economic growth has been slowing recently, prompting concern that <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> efforts to contain inflation could move the economy into a recession instead of the `` soft-landing'' it seeks. Economist <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm here, said the fact that consumer spending does not appear to be collapsing helps take the heat of the economy and reduce inflationary pressures. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier that retail sales had fallen 0.4 percent in June, dragged down in part by poor sales of autos. But excluding the automotive category, overall retail sales actually rose 0.1 percent, it said. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that auto loans fell $ 267 million in June, a 1.1 percent decline on a seasonally adjusted annual basis. They had risen 4.5 percent in May and 3.3 percent in April. But Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said car sales increased in July, `` so I think that the business of liquidating car loans is a very temporary kind of phenomena that's not going to continue and you might see a little bit of increase in car loans in July.'' Leading the overall consumer credit increase in June was the category of debt that includes credit cards. It rose $ 3.1 billion, a 20 percent annual rate of growth, after increasing 13 percent in May and 11 percent in April. Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said this reflects a shift toward retail credit, `` to soft goods like apparel and small items.'' Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate increased $ 404 million, a 2.5 percent annual rate of advance, but down from 7.2 percent in May and 2.8 percent in April. Borrowing for mobile homes fell for the fifth consecutive month, declining by $ 257 million or 12.9 percent on an annual basis. That followed drops of 2. l percent in May and 8.7 percent in The various changes left total consumer debt in June at a seasonally adjusted $ 701.19 billion.

<HEAD>Nielsen Plans to Develop National Hispanic TV Ratings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Executives of the nation's two largest Spanish-language television operations say they will be better equipped to compete for advertising dollars once a new national Hispanic television rating service is in operation. <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>'s service will attempt to define the audience for Spanish-language programming among people who identify themselves as Hispanic, information one executive called critical to the growth of the medium. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, the leader in English-language TV ratings for nearly 40 years, said Tuesday it had signed a multimillion-dollar contract to develop the Hispanic ratings service with the two largest Spanish-language television operators, <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For several months, <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> have been reviewing proposals from a half-dozen research firms for an Hispanic audience measurement system Executives of the two companies said the Nielsen Hispanic ratings will help them attract spending by advertisers and agencies who in the past have been skeptical about the estimated size of the Spanish-language TV audience. <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Hallmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is the nation's largest Spanish-language communications concern, operating a TV network reaching 85 percent of the estimated 6 million Hispanic households <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> operates the nation's second-largest Spanish-language network, reaching about 70 percent of all Hispanic households. Plans for the Hispanic ratings service, disclosed at a news conference here, call for a pilot test beginning this fall in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, which has a large Hispanic population. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> plans to begin recruiting 200 families for the sample group there starting next month. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>, a division of <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, plans to expand the service nationally to 800 Hispanic households in late 1990 or early 1991. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON>'s national sample for all programming is about 4,000 families of all kinds. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, research director for the firm <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Agoura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the Hispanic population has been growing much more rapidly than the general population and is expected next year to reach 22 million, or about 10 percent of the total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. There is some evidence that advertisers are beginning to recognize the economic clout that this group represents, which <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said the government estimates at $ 160 billion this year. Hispanic Business magazine estimated that 50 leading advertisers spent $ 500.1 million on advertising to the Hispanic market last year, up 12 percent from $ 490.7 million a year earlier. In the past week, companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have announced plans to increase their efforts at reaching Hispanics with Spanish-language advertising. But <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said advertisers are spending less than 1 percent of their estimated $ 30 billion annual television ad budgets on Spanish-language stations. He said one reason was skepticism about the size of the audience for Spanish-language programs. <ORGANIZATION> Telemundo </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> subscribe to a ratings service that uses weekly interviews to estimate their audience size, he said. <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said he expects the Nielsen ratings to confirm that 60 percent to 70 percent of Hispanic households are watching Spanish-language television, and that once advertisers recognize it their spending on the medium will rise. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> plans to use so-called people meters for the Spanish-language program ratings. The electronic devices allow people to push buttons that immediately record who in the family is watching particular shows. <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> has been using people meters for its national English-language ratings service for two years. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, president and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Univision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, said Spanish-language television networks face the same problems in dealing with advertisers as cable networks faced in the early 1980s before <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> started measuring their audiences. He said programming improvements and <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> audience ratings enabled cable networks to boost ad revenues to about $ 1.3 billion this year from $ 50 million at the start of the 1980s. <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said the quality of Spanish-language programming is `` a long way beyond'' where cable TV was at the start of the decade and said the new Nielsen ratings could prove `` critical to the growth of Spanish-language TV.''

<HEAD>Ampco-Pittsburgh Announces 6.6 Percent Stake in Airline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In the wake of <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement that it has acquired a 6.6 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the carrier's management is waiting to see whether the suitor will seek control <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> said in a document submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that it had acquired 662,000 shares of Midway common stock through a <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> III </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The filing was made public Tuesday. `` Ampco-Pittsburgh has not contacted the company in connection with this investment,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of Chicago-based Midway. The manufacturing concern said it bought the Midway shares `` for investment and to acquire a significant equity interest'' in the airline. Midway's stock reacted favorably to the disclosure. In composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading, it climbed $ 1.50 a share to close at $ 20.50. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> disclosure document said Pittsburgh-based <ORGANIZATION> Ampco </ORGANIZATION> `` may also consider seeking to acquire control'' of Midway `` in the future, although they have no plans or proposals to do so at present.'' According to the filing, <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> III </ORGANIZATION> bought the Midway shares at prices ranging from $ 14.75 to $ 18 between July 25 and last Thursday for a total of $ 10.3 million. <PERSON> Hinson </PERSON> said Thursday that Midway had not been approached by anyone seeking to take over the airline, despite heavy trading in the company's stock. Midway `` has no interest in being acquired,'' he said, attributing the stock activity to new interest in airlines as takeover targets. Midway was founded 10 years ago at the start of airline deregulation, when it served three <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> cities from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. The airline now serves 51 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, she said. Midway recently announced it had ordered 74 new jets from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell-Douglas </ORGANIZATION> worth about $ 2 billion. The airline, the nation's 16th-largest carrier, operates from <LOCATION> Midway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> and has 4,300 employees, Ms. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ampco-Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiaries _ which include <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ make and sell engineered products. <ORGANIZATION> Ampco </ORGANIZATION> is the sole shareholder in the subsidiary holding the airline stock. The company is a mystery to some airline analysts. `` They are n't a big player,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I've never heard of them.'' <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON> described Midway as a `` niche'' carrier, handling just 0.8 percent of the nation's air traffic. `` Their niche is that they dominate Midway Airport in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which is much closer to downtown than <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` It has the advantage that a lot of businessmen appreciate coming into Midway from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Joedicke </PERSON> said. He said the carrier has `` developed quite a successful hub in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for east-west traffic.'' Last week, Midway announced it had reached a $ 210 million deal with Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> to purchase routes, gates and aircraft from the strike-plagued carrier. The agreement must be approved by a federal bankruptcy court judge as part of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s strike-recovery plan to restructure into a smaller airline.

<HEAD>Suez Launches Largest Takeover Bid Ever In France</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> says it is launching <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s biggest ever takeover bid, in a hostile offer for <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>, with which it shares control of <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION>, a major French insurance group. The takeover proposal by <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, a Paris-based holding company which traces its history to the financing of the <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> more than a century ago, was said to be worth about $ 2.5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> shares fell sharply in early trading today, reflecting concern that the company is in for a long, tough battle that will be costly even if it wins. The price dropped from 369 francs -LRB- $ 57.66 -RRB- per share at Tuesday's close to 347 francs -LRB- $ 54.22 -RRB- just after today's opening, but then rebounded to 355 francs -LRB- $ 55.47 -RRB- at midday. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that if the bid is successful it will then make a tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> is offering to pay 13,000 francs -LRB- $ 2,030 -RRB- per share for the 81.53 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION> stock it does not already own. That would value the target company's total stock at 19.5 billion francs -LRB- about $ 3 billion -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> offer would total 15.9 billion francs -LRB- about $ 2.5 billion -RRB-. The previous record French takeover was a bid last year by <ORGANIZATION> Schneider </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 930 million for control of <ORGANIZATION> Telemecanique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>. But the success of the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> bid is far from assured, with <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>, expected to put up a tough resistance. `` Suez wants a majority, and I'm categorically opposed,'' <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON> was quoted as saying in Wednesday's edition of the daily <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION>. `` I made proposals for an arrangement. But if we have to go to battle, we will.'' Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> won a bruising takeover battle with Italian financier <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> for control of the huge Belgian holding company <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Groupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoire </PERSON> became much more attractive after making a friendly acquisition last month of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s second-largest insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Colonia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Versicherung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> said its bid would not affect the <LOCATION> Colonia </LOCATION> takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>'s shares were last quoted on the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Bourse at 9,750 francs -LRB- $ 1,525 -RRB-, before being suspended last Friday.

 Three commodities traders accused of cheating their customers became the first to plead guilty in the federal fraud investigation of the world's largest futures exchanges. Brothers <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON>, 29, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON>, 24, Tuesday pleaded guilty to one count each of violating the Commodities Exchange Act. The elder brother also pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, and the younger to one count of mail fraud. In addition, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Braniff </PERSON>, 33, pleaded guilty to two counts of violating the exchange act and two counts of mail fraud. The three men, yen traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, are among 46 traders indicted Aug. 2 in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Published reports have said as many as 30 defendants are expected to plead guilty and cooperate with authorities. After Tuesday's court hearings, defense lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Durkin </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Sledz </LOCATION> brothers aided federal investigators by agreeing to wear recording devices to tape conversations of fellow traders. The Sledz brothers entered their pleas before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovich </PERSON>. Additional defendants are scheduled for arraignment Wednesday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> faces a maximum penalty of six years in prison and a $ 350,000 fine, said the brothers' attorney, <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Spevack </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> could be sentenced to 10 years in prison and be fined $ 650,000. They have agreed to make restitution to customers, with the amounts to be determined later, he said. The charges in last week's indictments range from pre-arranged trading to racketeering conspiracy and tax fraud. Most allege schemes in which traders pocketed part of the profit from trades made for customers while passing their own losses on to customers. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON>'s plea agreement said he executed pre-arranged trades to make money for himself and his brother, and mailed confirmation of the trades to customers in violation of exchange rules, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> said he executed pre-arranged trades on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> brokerage houses to make a profit for himself and his brother. He confirmed the trades through wire communication, <PERSON> Spevack </PERSON> said. Both acknowledged engaging in `` numerous pre-arranged trades,'' the attorney said. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> said in his plea agreement that he conspired with trader <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sidel </PERSON> in July 1987 to defraud one of his customers by pre-arranging two trades for yen futures contracts. <PERSON> Sidel </PERSON> was indicted last week on charges of mail and wire fraud and violating the exchange act. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> also admitted to conspiring with an unidentified trader on two transactions in September 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 500,000 fine. The Sledz brothers sold their trading seats at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> in January when the first media reports of the undercover probe appeared. The three were barred from the floor of the exchange in an agreement last week with the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the exchanges, and still face disciplinary action, said <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Yemma </PERSON>. The brothers were released on $ 4,500 bond each pending sentencing, which is to be scheduled when the remaining cases against yen traders are resolved. A total of 21 traders were indicted for alleged illegal activities in the yen pit. The remaining 25 defendants traded in the Swiss franc pits at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> and the soybean and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond pits at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. While <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON>'s plea agreement did not name other traders, <PERSON> Spevack </PERSON> said, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> named three indicted traders with whom he engaged in pre-arranged trades _ <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>.

 A simpler car is in <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s future as consumers find themselves overwhelmed by an array of options and gadgets, the company's design chief says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>, vice president for design at the nation's No. 3 automaker, said Tuesday that car buyers are overloaded with choices to make when buying a car or truck. `` When you look at the marketplace of the future, where we have the greatest opportunity is this whole field of back to basics,'' he said. However, he cautioned that cars ca n't look incomplete, like basic cars of the past that had obvious places for clocks or air-conditioning units. `` In a much larger sense, that's what we're struggling with on how we handle the next generation of platforms,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will be introducing a new basic design in late 1992 for the 1993 model year. In <PERSON> Gale </PERSON>'s world of designing for the future, the cars that are built on those platforms are in the works today. `` When you get to a world where there are so many things, where there is so much technology and there's so many models, different models in different variations of those models, after a while, it's a blur,'' <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> said `` I think what the marketplace is telling us and what consumers are telling us is ` Hey, we're waiting for the guy who comes along and just says, ` Here's my <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, here's my Dodge.''' During last winter's car-show circuit, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> exhibited its Dodge Viper concept car, a two-seater stripped of a lot of the electronics that have made other cars more complex machines. Company Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> has said a decision will be made on whether to produce the Viper by early next year, and executives have said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> should build it. However, there is concern over whether it is economically wise to build the car amid predictions of a continuing slowdown in car and truck sales and a general softening of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. Two weeks ago, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s top 700 managers met in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and heard <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> outline a program aimed at taking $ 1 billion out of the company's costs. Included will be a reduction in the white-collar work force by about 2,300 people, or just more than 8 percent. Company executives said no plants would be closed and product development plans would remain in place during the cost-cutting. <PERSON> Gale </PERSON> said his department was n't exempt from the cost reductions.

<TEXT>
 A group of retired <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers have sued the automaker saying <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> reneged on health-care coverage promises. The group filed a class-action lawsuit Tuesday in federal court in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> on behalf of more than 80,000 salaried retirees, most of whom live in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The suit said the company last year eliminated or reduced some coverage for the retirees, including chiropractic and psychiatric care, and imposed copayments and deductibles on basic health coverage. The suit seeks restoration of benefits and compensation for those who paid the deductibles and copayments. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said the company had no comment on the suit because it had not had time to study it. `` <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said we would have these benefits for our lifetimes,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` I felt we had a moral and legal contract. `` They ca n't take it away now,'' said <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON>, an accountant who retired in 1982. <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said all salaried <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> workers should have known that their health care benefits could change. She said last year's changes were made to encourage active and retired employees to switch to more economical health care plans, such as health maintenance organizations. Currently, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> salaried workers have to pay the first $ 200 of medical costs annually and 20 percent of other costs with a $ 500 ceiling. Thus, a worker could spend up to $ 700 a year for health care. The family limit is $ 750 a year. `` We are all on fixed incomes and we are all at a state in our lives when we truly need all of the health benefits that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> promised us during our working years,'' <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> said the suit was filed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> because a retiree group is active there and that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> may have too much influence if the case was filed in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, faced with high debt payments and costs of extensive store renovations, has filed for protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code. Company chairman <PERSON> Sheldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantle </PERSON> said the board of directors concluded the company could not continue to make payments on its debt _ much of which was incurred by prior owners who bought the chain from founder <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> in 1984 for $ 160 million. `` Our board determined that it was far better to take this step now, while our company has substantial resources to implement a plan of reorganization.'' `` This makes a lot of sense,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gassman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, an analyst with Wheat, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. `` Emotionally it was hard for them to make that decision, but over the long term -LRB- the company -RRB- will emerge much stronger because it allows them to renegotiate its long-term debt.'' <PERSON> Fantle </PERSON> led a group of investors that took over management of the company in November 1987. At that time, <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> owed more than $ 164 million to bondholders and to its bank lenders. It has paid more than $ 26 million in principal and interest payments on that debt. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> operates 69 retail drug stores in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and five Total-Plus discount stores in the <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> has more than 2,000 employees and had sales of about $ 170 million in the fiscal year ended in 1989. Its loss in the third quarter ended April 29 narrowed to $ 7.3 million from $ 9.6 million last year. Revenue in the first nine months fell 26 percent, to $ 128.8 million from $ 174.9 million a year ago. <PERSON> Haft </PERSON> founded <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> in 1954. He sold the company to a management group in 1984 before going on to make a series of unsuccessful corporate takeover attempts under the mantle of his <ORGANIZATION> Dart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is unrelated to the drugstore chain. <PERSON> Fantle </PERSON> attempted to revamp the company by remodeling stores, placing new emphasis on customer service, a financial restructuring and an unusual plan to donate 5 percent of the company's gross receipts to charity. The company filed a petition in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, placing <PERSON> Dart </PERSON> and its subsidiaries under the protection of the <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> while the company prepares a plan of reorganization.

While the day-to-day operations will be up to management, major actions such as borrowing money would be subject to approval of the court.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has found a small crack in a fourth <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-100 jetliner since the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ordered an industry-wide inspection in July. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that to date, cracks have been found in the metallic skins of four <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> 727s and one <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> 727. The cracks ranged in size from 20 inches to less than half an inch. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest airline, previously reported finding cracks in three planes. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether to order continuing inspections of the 31 oldest 727s registered in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said agency spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Duff </PERSON>. The inspections might also be broadened to include somewhat newer 727-100s as well, he said. The cracks, first discovered on <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> jets, occur on the seam that joins the upper and lower parts of the fuselage. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> modified the way the seam was joined after building the first 46 727s, increasing the thickness of the splice by inserting a spacer piece of metal between the overlapping fuselage sections. `` We had never seen cracking along the lower rivet row -LRB- at the splice -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Duff </PERSON> said. `` This was something new.'' Though the cracks' safety implication is not fully understood, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> issued an emergency directive ordering airlines to inspect the aging 727s for the fuselage cracks, and not to fly the planes until they were inspected and any cracks repaired. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and American planes have been repaired and are back in service. Each of the planes had accumulated 46,000 to 49,000 flights. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had billed the planes as having a design life cycle of 20 years and 60,000 flights, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> still believes the planes can fly indefinitely with proper maintenance, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> has released details of its cashless offer for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, but BAT again advised shareholders not to accept the offer valued at some $ 21.6 billion. In a new twist in <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>'s pursuit of the big British conglomerate, former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> emerged as an investor in the proposed deal and may be interested in buying BAT's <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> insurance division, according to a report published today. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> said it values its stock-and-debt offer for BAT at the equivalent of $ 14.14 a share, but the stock closed at $ 13.65 a share Tuesday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up 5 cents. The filing of an offer document is a normal step in British takeover procedures. The offer must now stay open at least 21 days. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>, consisting of Anglo-French financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> merchant banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>, Australian investor <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> and other investors, said Tuesday the group would n't specify how it might make the debt package behind their takeover offer more marketable until after the bid's standing with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulators is clear. For every 100 ordinary BAT shares, <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> would pay <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> variable-interes senior secured notes valued at $ 684, subordinated <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> notes valued at $ 418.20 and $ 274 worth of <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> exchangeable loan stock convertible into 387 shares of <ORGANIZATION> Anglo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> company. Later, BAT issued a statement from the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, headquarters of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> BATUS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, reiterating its rejection of the proposed buyout and advising stockholders not to sell their shares. BAT, which is the world's biggest tobacco company, said its international concentration on growth businesses had paid off with a 38 percent compound return to shareholders since 1980 and there was continued potential for rapid earnings growth. BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> stated that the <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> offer ignored those prospects and consisted of securities `` of dubious value.'' `` The scheme is principally designed to enrich Messrs. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> at the expense of <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>' shareholders,'' <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> stated Some of BAT's institutional investors have attacked the bid's lack of cash and of any assurance that the debt offered in exchange for BAT shares would be tradable <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> said the group could n't speculate on how and when all the details of the debt package would come to light but said <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` would n't have lent their names to such an effort'' if the securities could n't be made liquid. The Wall Street Journal reported that the unexpected intervention of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> in the proposed acquisition of BAT _ which would be <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s biggest takeover _ could lend credibility to the takeover attempt led by <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> told the Journal that `` you have to consider <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> an interested player'' in any <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> sale of Farmers, which BAT acquired late last year for $ 5.2 billion. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> has indicated that if he prevails in his quest for BAT he would retain the company's tobacco business and sell its retail, paper and financial services divisions. Besides Farmers, BAT's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations include the retail chains <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>. In an interview with the newspaper, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> described his interest in Farmers as preliminary and he said there were n't any firm plans for a sale of Farmers by <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>. The bid for BAT is being reviewed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurance regulators. The Hoylake investors intend to explore whether `` it makes a difference'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulators whether it is <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> who ends up acquiring Farmers, said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who has become a pioneer of leveraged buy-outs since leaving government service. BAT has been lobbying the British government to investigate the proposed takeover, on the grounds that the highly leveraged financing was against the public interest.

 Eastern Airline pilots in informal voting have strongly favored sustaining their 5-month-old strike against the troubled carrier, union officials say. About 200 Eastern pilots based in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> area gathered Tuesday at a <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, airport hotel. Similar closed-door meetings took place Tuesday evening in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s home base of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> members meeting in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> voted 203-15 in favor of continuing the strike, union officials said. `` We're going to keep going, rededicate our efforts and win the strike,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, pilots voted 285-15 to continue the strike, said <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. `` The mood is now that we're going to start acting like a union,'' said <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, an Eastern captain. `` We're going to start getting the other unions involved, the people who serve <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> with the fuel, the maintenance and so forth, and we're gon na start acting like a union, finally. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern are both subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> meeting continued into the early morning hours today without a vote, <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> said. Late Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> voted 493-121 not to return to work. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> leaders will take the results of these and other straw ballots scheduled for this week to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where they will be discussed by the group's 20-member master executive council. The council will plan future strike action. `` Democracy will take its course,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union, said as he left the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> meeting for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. At a pilots meeting Sunday in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> had presented as his personal view a proposal for calling off the strike, according to an <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> member who attended the gathering. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> -RRB- has no right to say that; it's not within his authority to say that,'' said the pilot, who asked not to be identified. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen said much of the sentiment in the meetings was to urge a national suspension of airline service on Labor Day weekend. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazor </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters, said the union's national leadership has not taken a position yet on whether it would support a national walkout. He said the possibility of a national walkout was among the topics discussed in a meeting Tuesday between <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> said the federation's executive council would meet with <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> leaders about organized labor efforts on behalf of striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> workers. Asked whether he expected pilots at other airlines to heed the call for a national job action, <PERSON> Bavis </PERSON> replied: `` I'm hopeful. I think all the pilots in the country have a stake in what's going on here.'' Pilots and flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> walked out in sympathy with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union after it struck the carrier March 4. The airline has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization since March 9. Eastern management has said that under its plan to reorganize as a smaller carrier it will need only 1,700 pilots. <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> has 3,600 members employed by Eastern. `` I do n't think we'll have any comment on the pilots' votes,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Also, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said, Eastern is no longer divulging how many <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> pilots have crossed picket lines. In the past, the company announced rising numbers of crossovers, but <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> would not explain the reason for the policy change. Eastern last week said pilot crossovers since the strike began numbered 385, up from 200 at the outset. In addition, 300 newly hired pilots had completed training and 700 more were in training, the company said.

<TEXT>
 Corn futures were lower, but soybeans and wheat prices moved marginally higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The dip in corn prices was attributed to the unusually high estimate of crop production released Tuesday by influential private forecaster <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s forecast for soybeans was bearish as well, most traders apparently thought a late wave of selling at Tuesday's close was overdone and few sellers materialized after the opening bell today Price swings may be at a minimum over the next two days in all the grain pits as traders adjust their positions in anticipation of Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> report on actual crop production.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is asking several prestigious universities for documents as part of an antitrust investigation into how they set tuition and student aid rates, officials say. The department, while declining to discuss the thrust of the investigation, acknowledged that it is seeking certain documents. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON>, general counsel at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said the request was for documents dealing with `` student financial aid, budgeting and other fees and salaries.'' <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleinbard </PERSON>, vice president for news and community affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> said today that his institution was cooperating with a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> request `` for information concerning the procedures by which it establishes its tuition.'' `` Specifically, the ... department is interested in whether institutions of higher education have entered into arrangements or understandings as to prospective tuition rates that may violate federal antitrust laws,'' he said. `` At no time has the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> participated in any agreement or understanding with any other institution as to the setting of its tuition,'' <PERSON> Kleinbard </PERSON> said. When asked about possible agreements relating to financial aid, he said, `` We do n't do it _ pure and simple.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> confirmed that document requests `` have gone out to a number of colleges,'' but he declined to disclose the subjects of the request. `` Antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public record,'' he said. `` You can say this is in a preliminary stage,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said, adding that the first requests were made `` sometime earlier this summer, perhaps six weeks ago.'' `` Essentially, they've asked us to produce a lot of documents with regard to our budget, how we budget,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mersereau </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Bowdoin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's an extensive amount of documentation, and we are complying.'' Universities have shared financial information about students for years, even arranging to use copies of a single financial statement submitted by parents of applicants seeking scholarships and other aid. There have been reports that major universities agree among themselves on the aid packages to be offered, generally mixtures of scholarships, loans and campus jobs. Such agreements, if they exist, would be of interest to the antitrust division, which enforces the legal ban against price-fixing by private commercial companies. There are well-known aid agreements among universities, such as limits on athletic scholarships that members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collegiate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> may offer. Members of the Ivy League have agreed not to offer athletic scholarships and to base offers of financial aid on student need. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> declined to say whether cooperating universities agree on aid packages to be offered to applicants. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said in today's editions the department's requests had gone to 20 institutions, among them <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bowdoin </ORGANIZATION> colleges, <ORGANIZATION> Tufts </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> universities and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> `` will be cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in giving them the data they've requested,'' <PERSON> Steiner </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc.. Wednesday said it amended provisions of its shareholders' rights plan to lower the amount of common stock a shareholder must own to be The amendment lowers from 25 percent to 15 percent the ownership of the company's common stock that results in the rights kicking in, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, public relations director of <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION>, which produces diesel engines, components and power systems. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the amendment would have no immediate effect, since no one shareholder has acquired 15 percent of the company's common stock Last December, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arm of the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> announced it had acquired 8.32 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION>' common stock, then filed for permission to increase its holdings up to 15 percent. Last month, <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON>' 80-year-old former chairman, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, and other family members bought back the shares to allay fears the engine-maker might be bought and moved. Nine days later, Industrial Equity -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a Hong Kong-based investment concern, paid $ 60.2 million for 1.01 million shares, or 9.9 percent of common stock. IEP filed for permission from the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to increase its stake to between 15 percent and 25 percent. <ORGANIZATION> IEP </ORGANIZATION> officials have said the purchase was made for investment and takeover purposes. `` All of these factors were considered by the board when it inacted the amendment,'' Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said today. The company adopted its shareholder rights plan three years ago and declared a dividend of one right per outstanding share of common stock. When the rights become effective, they entitle the holder to buy one share of common stock for $ 200. Under certain circumstances, the rights entitle the stockholder to purchase for $ 200 common stock with a market value of two times the purchase price.

 The dollar closed firmer Wednesday in European trading after retreating from the day's peaks. Gold prices were mixed in moderate trading.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today signed far-reaching legislation to rescue the nation's ailing savings and loan industry, calling the measure `` a first step, a crucial step, toward restoring public confidence.'' `` I'm proud to sign this monster,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a Rose Garden ceremony attended by architects of the nearly foot-high bill, which authorizes $ 50 billion in new government borrowing over the next 26 months. The bill also imposes tough new standards on savings and loan institutions and triggers the most sweeping overhaul of the regulatory bureaucracy in 50 years. Along with the late-morning signing of the measure, the president was ordering his administration to gear up to close or merge hundreds of failed institutions. The first meeting of a new board to oversee their holdings was called immediately after the ceremony. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the measure, which received final congressional approval Saturday, `` says to tens of millions of savings and loan depositors: you will not be the victims of others' mistakes.'' Among the 300 or so people at the signing ceremony were <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and key <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> sponsors, including Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairmen of the congressional banking committees To the president's right were mock-ups of the new emblems that the institutions will put on their doors to assure depositors their money is safe. One proclaims in bold, white letters against a gold background: `` Deposits Federally Insured _ Backed Up by the Full Faith and Credit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Government.'' `` This legislation comes to grips with the problems facing our savings and loan industry. It will safeguard and stabilize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s financial system,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared. He called the measure, a variation on a bailout plan he submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Feb. 6, `` historic legislation.'' `` It is responsive and responsible. And for that, I salute the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' the president said. Immediately after the signing ceremony, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> was conducting the first meeting of the board overseeing the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> was created to manage the sale of sour loans and repossessed real estate the government is inheriting from ailing savings and loans. The <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> board, whose members also include <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, will approve operating policies for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the agency charged with managing the bailout. It also will appoint top staff members to oversee the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> already has taken over 262 failed thrifts, and the first deals to wipe out their losses and put them in the hands of new owners could come as early as this week. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced plans to borrow the first $ 5 billion installment of the bailout Thursday and said it intends to raise an additional $ 15 billion within eight weeks. Analysts say the bill, the first major legislative initiative of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency, will touch the lives of anyone who pays taxes, deposits money in a bank or thrift or owns real estate, particularly in the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>. The savings and loan industry will emerge leaner and more closely regulated, bu perhaps no better able to earn a profit, analysts say. By providing the money to close failed thrifts, which must pay high interest rates to attract deposits, the bill should allow remaining institutions, including banks, to lower their rates. The massive sale of real estate by the government could endanger property values in already fragile markets in oil-producing states in such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. Thrifts that ca n't measure up to tougher financial and accounting standards face takeover by government regulators or merger with bigger and stronger institutions _ including commercial banks, which for the first time will be permitted to buy healthy savings and loans. `` In five years I expect there'll be less than a thousand thrifts,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Currently there are about 3,000 savings and loan institutions. The prospects for thrifts that remain are mixed. Optimists point out that the bill, by lowering deposit rates, will make it easier for healthy institutions to earn a profit. Also, it should restore public confidence in the government's guarantee of savers' accounts up to $ 100,000, helping stem a record outflow of deposits this year `` The industry that is going to emerge from this is going to be fewer in number, but certainly stronger,'' said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeksma </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's largest trade group Pessimists, however, say the industry's contribution to the bailout will pinch thrift earnings. They also note that the bill will force savings and loans to concentrate more heavily on safer, but less lucrative, home mortgage lending just as the economy and real estate markets are entering a slow-growth period at best and a recession at worst. `` I think it's exactly the wrong thing to do,'' said economist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting company. `` It's consigning the thrift industry to low profitability, at least over the next two or three years.''

<TEXT>
 The savings and loan industry will emerge leaner and more closely regulated, but perhaps no better able to earn a profit, as a result of legislation signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday, analysts say. The bill, enacted six months after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first called for emergency action to solve a crisis inherited from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, is expected to profoundly alter and probably drastically shrink a business that has enjoyed a privileged position in the nation's financial system for more than 50 years. Savings and loans, because they financed the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dream of home ownership, have been permitted to operate under accounting standards and capital requirements much more lax than those applied to commercial banks. No longer. In 120 days, thrift owners will be required to back every $ 100 in lending with $ 1.50 in tangible capital, which will act as a cushion between future losses and government insurance funds. By 1995, the standard will reach $ 3. An estimated 77 percent of the nation's 2,946 S & amp; Ls meet the 1.5 percent standard and two-thirds already satisfy the 3 percent requirement that is more than five years away, according to <ORGANIZATION> Sheshunoff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Those that ca n't measure up face takeover by government regulators or merger with bigger and stronger institutions. Because the legislation for the first time permits banks to buy solvent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, even prosperous institutions could be quickly scooped up by large holding companies anxious to expand their retail branch network. The bill makes it easier for banks to smoothly integrate thrifts into their operation. `` In five years I expect there'll be less than a thousand thrifts,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a financial institutions analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` Five hundred to 1,000 thrifts will be shut down by the government, the rest will go because banks will seek to acquire them and they will seek to be acquired. It will be a two-way street.'' The prospects for thrifts that remain after the shakeout are mixed. Optimists point out that the bill, by eliminating ailing <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls that bid up interest rates on deposits, will make it easier for healthy institutions to raise low-cost funds. Also, by putting the taxpayers' money where politicians' mouths are, the bill should restore public confidence in the government's guarantee of savers' accounts up to $ 100,000, helping to stem a record outflow of deposits this year `` The industry that is going to emerge from this is going to be fewer in number, but certainly stronger,'' said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeksma </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the industry's largest trade group `` I think the positives clearly outweigh the negatives. It will probably reduce, if not eliminate, the adverse publicity we've had ... by once again underscoring that government insurance of accounts is just that and people do n't have to worry about losing their money,'' said <PERSON> Beeksma </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Interwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. Pessimists, however, say that the industry's share of the bailout will pinch thrift earnings in two ways: through higher deposit insurance premiums and by skimming profits from the 12 regional, industry-owned <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> S & amp; L losses far exceeded profits in 1987 and 1988 but embership in the regional banks, the industry's financing arm, provided thrifts that did make money with a third of their earnings last year. The regional banks, as part of the bailout, are contributing all of their retained earnings, $ 3.5 billion, as well as $ 300 million a year in profits. Moreover, institutions will see their deposit insurance premium rise by 10 percent, from 20.8 cents per $ 100 to 23 cents. Pessimists also note that the bill will force <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to concentrate more heavily on safer but less lucrative home mortgage lending just as the economy and real estate markets are entering into a slow-growth period at best and a recession at worst. Thrifts are now required to devote 70 percent of their assets to housing loans, up from a 60 percent standard that had many more loopholes. `` I think it's exactly the wrong thing to do,'' said economist <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` It's consigning the thrift industry to low profitability, at least over the next two or three years. Also, <PERSON> Getman </PERSON> warned that, perversely, government action to resolve the thrift crisis could have the effect of further unnerving depositors. `` Eventually the bailout is going to increase confidence in the industry, but that's a ways off. People are going to see institutions closing left and right. It's going to be hard to explain to them that we're making a better industry when they see their local thrift going under,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tips For Traveling With Credit Cards, Travelers Checks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Credit Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Here are a few financial safety tips for travelers, according to industry experts and consumer groups:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 _ Keep most of your money in travelers checks They're safer than cash because the issuer gives full or partial refunds for lost or stolen checks. Checks in foreign currency may be available at a major bank at official exchange rates, usually without service fees. _ Carry <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars and the currency of whatever country you're <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> money should be in small denominations to handle minor expenses, such as tips or parking, before or after departure. _ Bring at least one major credit card for either identification or purchases Two is better, since not all cards are universally accepted, but leave the cards you do n't expect to use at home. _ Try to buy all your travel tickets through a credit card, if possible It's often easier to get replacement tickets and many credit-card companies provide limited travel insurance. _ After charging meals, souvenirs or other items destroy all charge card carbons immediately _ Double check your credit card bill to ensure all purchases are listed correctly, and contact your bank or credit-card company immediately if there's an incorrect expense Cardholders are liable for up to $ 50 of unauthorized purchases before they report a card stolen or lost but they're not liable for any purchases after a report is filed.

<HEAD>Target Of Largest French Takeover Bid Promises Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION> will resist the largest takeover bid ever attempted in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a $ 2.5 billion offer from a former ally, its president said Wednesday. <PERSON> Jean-Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON>, head of the holding company under attack from <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, a Paris-based bank holding company, declined to discuss what allies he might be lining up for the fight. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> won a long and difficult takeover battle last year with Italian financier <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> for control of the huge Belgian holding company <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION>. The prize in the takeover battle is <PERSON> Groupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoire </PERSON>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s second-biggest insurance group <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>, which traces its corporate history to the financing of the <LOCATION> Suez </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> more than a century ago, currently shares control of <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> proposes to offer the equivalent of $ 2,030 per share for the 81.5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION> stock it does not already own. That would value the target company's equity at $ 3 billion and the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> offer would total about $ 2.5 billion. <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON> was quoted by the French news agency <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France-Presse </ORGANIZATION> as saying he would make no statement until the hostile takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> has been approved by stock market regulatory authorities. The regulatory decision is expected on Aug. 18, and if the bid is approved, stockholders then would have a month to decide whether to sell at that price. Trading in <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION> stock has been frozen since Friday. It was last quoted on the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Bourse at the equivalent of $ 1,525 per share. The price of <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> shares fell to $ 55.55 a share from $ 57.66 on Wednesday in active trading. <PERSON> Groupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoire </PERSON> was originally part of the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> holdings, but when it appeared likely that the Socialists would win the 1981 elections, <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>'s president at the time, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, quietly transferred control to the holding company <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>, which he controlled along with allies including the <PERSON> Dassault </PERSON> family. When the new Socialist government indeed nationalized <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> along with other banks and industrial firms, it was surprised to find the Groupe Victoire insurance company no longer a <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, although <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> did retain a minority interest _ partly direct and partly through <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>. The conservative government elected in 1986 sold <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> to private investors, but its new owners have had uneasy relations with <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON>, who succeeded <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> as head of <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> said if its takeover bid is successful, it will then make a tender offer for the <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> company </ORGANIZATION>'s parent, <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> du <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> already owns 30 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION>, but apparently is unhappy as simply a silent investor. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> also owns 18.47 percent of the shares of <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>, which has 40 percent of the capital and 48 percent of the voting rights of <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Groupe </PERSON> <PERSON> Victoire </PERSON> became much more attractive after making a friendly acquisition last month of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s second-largest insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Colonia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Versicherung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> said its bid would not affect the <LOCATION> Colonia </LOCATION> takeover. <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that its bid for <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION> was part of its preparation for the dropping of barriers within the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> after 1992. Reports in several French newspapers Wednesday said <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON> would likely line up support from the <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> group of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to help fight off the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> takeover bid. <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON> is also president of Beghin-Say, a French paper-making unit of <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON> declined to comment on the reports that <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> would be involved. Under French stock market regulations, any competing bid for <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION>, either by <PERSON> Vernes </PERSON> allies or others, would have to be at least 5 percent higher than the <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION> tender offer. The main asset of <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrielle </ORGANIZATION> is its controlling stake in <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victoire </ORGANIZATION>. It also has some real estate and minority industrial holdings.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans know <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> as a $ 2 million-a-year slugger who can wallop a baseball, but in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s financial world the name refers to someone known for a different kind of big bang That <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> is a lawyer, securities professional and son of a Spanish banker. Last month he was elected chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at age 36, making him the youngest person to head a major securities market. More importantly, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> has been presiding over a profound reform in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s securities industry that's shattered the 160-year-old shackles of government control, a revolution known as `` El Big Bang.'' It officially began July 29, when the state monopoly on securities trading ended. Stock exchanges became private businesses. Government-appointed stockbrokers were replaced by private brokerages. After a transition period, once-fixed commissions will be freely negotiatable. Like the `` Big Bang'' deregulation of the British markets a few years ago, the Spanish securities overhaul is aimed at making stock trading more competitive, efficient and attractive to foreigners seeking opportunities in one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s fastest-growing economies. `` The changeover has gone very well, although we've still got a long road to run,'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said in an interview. `` Many people, especially in the business press, did not believe we would be ready by the July 29 deadline, but we were.'' He's not related to the Dominican-born <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> who bats cleanup for the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cardinals </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But their aggressiveness is strikingly similar. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>'s management of the El Big Bang changeover at <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>'s stock exchange, where 70 percent of Spanish stocks are traded, has overshadowed his conspicuous youth in a profession historically dominated by rigid thinking and slow-moving brokers accustomed to the life of government bureaucrats `` He talks about selling products and services,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez-Lagos </PERSON>, 67, a 38-year career stockbroker and president of the Hispano brokerage. `` This is precisely the difference between the old exchange and the new one.'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> smokes heavily and wears modest clothes that belie his wealth. He made a fortune channeling investment funds from foreign markets into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> through the <LOCATION> Asesores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bursatiles </LOCATION> brokerage, which he helped found. In 1988, Asesores accounted for more than 5 percent of total volume on the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> exchange, 80 percent of that from foreign investors. His youth stands in marked contrast to other world stock exchange leaders. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phelan </PERSON> is 58, for example. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> is 58. <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caty </PERSON> is 48. <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Minoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagaoka </PERSON> is 65. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> attributed his election by the revamped stock exchange's 51 members partly to what he called an across-the-board generational change in Spanish society. He mentioned <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Croissier </PERSON>, 38, named president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the government agency that will police the markets under the reform. Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> is only 47, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> noted. `` In other places where there has been a long, stable history and much tradition, my election might not have been possible,'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. `` But I'm a firm believer in putting younger people in important posts.'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said his priorities include revising the cumbersome time-consuming system for finalizing stock trades and developing the nation's first stock-options market. Options, widely traded by speculators in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are rights to buy or sell stocks within a set time for a set price. He also intends to expand computerized trading, introduced in April using a model of the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s Computer Automated Trading System. The Spanish CATS network links the <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> exchange to smaller exchanges in <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bilbao </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Valencia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said 22 percent of all trading is now done via CATS and the figure should double by the end of the year, as the historical open-outcry system of traders shouting bids gradually is phased out. His fast rise in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s securities industry reflects <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON>'s own intense drive and ambition He placed first seven years ago in the tough state exams for his stockbroker's diploma. But he was never completely satisfied just peddling stocks and looked for other opportunities. In 1984, he and two friends visited financial institutions in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to discuss their preparations for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s market deregulation. That's where he got the idea for what became an immensely successful business in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. `` They all wanted to hear about Spanish investment possibilities,'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said. `` They said if there was a firm in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> that could provide top-quality research and services, it would get all the clients it could handle and more.'' <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> and friends returned to <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> and formed <LOCATION> Asesores </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bursatiles </LOCATION>. In 1985, the firm channeled about $ 350 million in foreign investments into the Spanish markets. Last year they handled $ 3.8 billion, mainly in foreign money, and have since diversified the firm into other corporate financial services. Asked if he was concerned that <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s market deregulation would incite rampant greed and fraud, <PERSON> Guerrero </PERSON> said he believed the government could still police the securities industry. `` I'm completely confident that the new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is going to strongly discourage this and be very tough on rule-breakers,'' he said. As an example, he mentioned the commission's recent probe of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s Spanish subsidiary. Even before any formal action was taken, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> shut down the operation July 17 after determining it had improperly sold securities in a Spanish oil company.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities will have to borrow tens of billions of dollars from other countries to help bail out failed savings and loans institutions, dollars foreigners will someday use to compete for scarcer goods in this country, an economist predicted Wednesday. The bill President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed Wednesday authorizes borrowing $ 50 billion over the next 26 months. The total cost of the bailout will be far higher because of interest costs. Foreigners already buy future claims on this country at a rate of $ 10 billion a month through their purchases of American bonds, shares, real estate and other property. Americans do not save enough of their own money to pay for the things they want from foreigners now, so the needed money has to be lent to this country from abroad. `` Unfortunately, people in government focus on short-term problems and not on the long term,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Canzoneri </PERSON>, professor of economics at <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm a baby-boomer. In the long run, there'll be fewer people in this country to produce goods to support me in my old age. The same is true of Mr. <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ and the Japanese population is getting older faster than ours is.'' <PERSON> Canzoneri </PERSON> sees Japanese and other foreigners wanting to cash in their loans and investments and use the dollars to buy up <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods at a time when fewer American goods will be produced in proportion to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. All that money chasing fewer goods will run up prices, lower living standards and bring pressures to cut pensions in this country, he predicted. <PERSON> Canzoneri </PERSON> also predicts additional government borrowing will cause short-term problems. `` Lenders in Wall Street may get jittery,'' he said. `` That would drive up interest rates. That will increase the cost of the federal government's deficit. Then there would be pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> to push interest rates down. That would mean even more borrowing and the threat of inflation.''

<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> is in search of the perfectly cooked chicken, but his tools are more likely to include a slide rule than a spatula. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, a 26-year-old graduate chemical engineering student at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION>, is trying to create a mathematical model for showing how quickly chicken pieces will cook under varying conditions. Financed by a $ 15,000 grant from <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> is attempting to develop the model for his masters thesis at the Equipment Performance Lab of the company's Col. <ORGANIZATION> Sanders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` Basically all cooking is a physical phenomenon,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Mohan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, a senior research scientist for <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest fried chicken chain. With <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>' model, `` we should be able to tell exactly what the process should be,'' he said. Whenever the company changes its brand of shortening or uses a new type of pressure cooker, it has to alter the cooking procedure. The company would use the formula being developed by <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> to replace trial and error testing methods. `` Minor improvements in productivity translate into a significant amount of money,'' says <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Detwiler </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fried </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicken </ORGANIZATION>, which sells nearly $ 6 billion worth of chicken and other foods annually. Using an overhead projector, <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> creates graph outlines of drumsticks measured in two positions to arrive at an average dimension. Then, with what <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> says is best explained as <PERSON> Fourier </PERSON>'s Law, he uses the measurements to work out an equation that will predict how quickly various parts of the chicken will cook. <PERSON> Fourier </PERSON>'s Law states that with two masses, `` the greater the temperature difference, the faster the heat transfers,'' <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> said. The 40-year-old <PERSON> Rao </PERSON> spent 15 years as a professor of food processing at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Last month, he was named an adjunct professor at the university, where he will teach a class on food processing next spring. <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said he had no `` particular interest in working with chicken'' before he was selected for the project. However, standing in a room surrounded by trays of fried chicken, <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> said he might consider a career in food-process control.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> will do whatever it takes to restore confidence after 46 traders were indicted as a result of a sweeping federal probe of trading fraud, the exchange chairman pledged Wednesday. `` We do not tolerate a single customer being abused on our exchange,'' board Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> told the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which ended its three-day session Wednesday. `` We want your confidence. We will do anything and everything to keep it.'' <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> told council members the board has increased its audit and investigation staff by 30 percent, and on Thursday will consider a proposal to increase the penalty for each rule violation to $ 250,000 from $ 75,000. `` That's how bad they want a clean house,'' he said of the tougher policies, which followed last week's indictment of dozens of traders at the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> also defended the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> decision to order the sale of some July soybean contracts as `` a last resort'' to keep the market operating smoothly. But farmer <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintzle </PERSON> of Coggon, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, said there still are too many unanswered questions about the soybean sale, which primarily affected an Italian processor, <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziaria </ORGANIZATION> SpA. `` I think the the <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> deal is bothering the farmers in gravel-road <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> even more than the indictments,'' <PERSON> Kintzle </PERSON> said. `` If they had left the market run, we'd have had $ 8 or $ 9 beans. Farmers might not have sold but at least they would have had the opportunity.'' The Board of Trade move was widely interpreted as an effort to break up an attempt to corner the market. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> denied that was its aim, saying it needed the beans for its crushing operation and customers. The action forced <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> to give up nearly all of its July contracts for the delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans. The <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> already had taken steps to cancel an exemption that allowed <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> to hold contracts for more than the 3 million-bushel limit. The federal agency has said there were contracts for delivery of about 40 million bushels of soybeans and only about 12 million bushels available. <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> preferred to apply its liquidation order `` across the marketplace,'' to everyone with more than 3 million bushels, whether they were buyers or sellers. The order required people to liquidate 20 percent of their contracts each day, and to have contracts for no more than 1 million bushels of beans on July 20, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> plan would have forced <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> to liquidate contracts for 20 million bushels in one day, <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> said. `` That would have had long-lasting, devastating consequences on the soybean complex,'' he said. `` I would n't have wanted to speculate on where prices would have gone.'' But farmer <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oreana </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, was uneasy about the move. `` I have some concerns that it affected the credibility of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, and some farmers still have problems with that,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Feed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grains </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization of farm and agribusiness groups, was formed in 1960 to promote export markets for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, barley and sorghum.

 The value of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> citrus land is rising, reflecting a general improvement in the agricultural economy and a comeback from winter freezes, according to a new survey.

Relatively mild weather has prevailed during the past four winters and citrus planting has been active. About 125,000 acres were planted statewide in 1986 and 1987, industry figures show. The value of an acre of mature grapefruit groves in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was placed at $ 10,265 an acre, a 5.5 percent jump from November 1988. In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, grapefruit groves were valued at $ 10,420 an acre, a 2.7 percent increase.

 Corn futures were lower but soybeans and wheat prices mostly higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Corn was under pressure at the opening bell because of the unusually high crop production estimate released after the close of business Tuesday by influential private forecaster <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s forecast for soybeans was bearish as well, most traders apparently felt that was discounted during the late wave of selling at Tuesday's close. Wheat got its support from a small but steady stream of export business, including rumors of a possible buy _ perhaps as much as 600,000 tons _ by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Also supporting prices in the pit was the hot, dry weather in growing areas of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Trading remained in a narrow range and is expected to do so again Thursday as traders square their positions in anticipation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> report on actual crop production.

 <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has completed the acquisition of a bottling and distribution subsidiary of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pernod-Ricard </ORGANIZATION> group, putting an end to a dispute that has soured relations between the two beverage companies for almost two years <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> said it has agreed to pay the equivalent of about $ 140 million for <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parisienne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boissons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazeuses </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> SPBG </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and its subsidiaries, which have bottled and distributed soft drinks in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> under license from Coca-Cola for the past 40 years. <ORGANIZATION> Pernod-Ricard </ORGANIZATION> put the price higher, at about $ 155 million. A spokesman said the difference reflected a payment covering items such as current contracts and goodwill. <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to take over its bottling and distribution activities in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> is part of a broader strategy of boosting consumption of its products worldwide. The conflict between <ORGANIZATION> Pernod-Ricard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> arose when the Atlanta-based company said it wanted to take over the French operations, claiming that <ORGANIZATION> Pernod-Ricard </ORGANIZATION> was not trying hard enough to market Coca-Cola products in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pernod-Ricard </ORGANIZATION> accused Coca Cola of breach of contract and took the matter to court. <ORGANIZATION> SPBG </ORGANIZATION>'s sales of <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> products last year totalled roughly $ 220 million, or 42 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pernod-Ricard </ORGANIZATION>'s soft-drinks business last year. <PERSON> Cyriac </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Salaberry </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said the bulk of the purchase price reflects real-estate assets, mainly bottling plants and storage depots. Apart from <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> SPBG </ORGANIZATION> bottles and distributes <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> soft drinks under the brand names Sprite, Fanta and <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>. By acquiring <ORGANIZATION> SPBG </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> now has control of more than 90 percent of its products sold in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday bought out the federal government's 51 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, completing the $ 1.32 billion purchase of the institution created in the nation's costliest bank failure. The buyout, announced 10 days ago, comes four years ahead of a timetable established last year when <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> was selected to manage the 40 failed banks of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> RepublicBank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In that deal, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, N.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> also got a five-year option to buy all of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' largest bank holding company, which has $ 27.9 billion in assets. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> changed the company's name to <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> at that time. With the acquisition, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> becomes the nation's ninth-largest commercial bank, with about $ 60 billion in assets and $ 43.2 billion in deposits. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> paid $ 210 million for a 20 percent share of <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Nov. 22, then accelerated its plans, paying $ 310 million for an additional 29 percent on April 28 and $ 800 million for the remaining shares Wednesday. The price gives a $ 270 million profit to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which provided $ 840 million of the initial recapitalization of First RepublicBank. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> also is financing part of Wednesday's purchase through a $ 320 million in a one-year, interest-bearing note. In all, the government has estimated the First RepublicBank rescue will cost $ 3 billion. Improved profits at the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> institution led to <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to move up its purchase, the bank said last month. <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 63.1 million in the second quarter, with $ 28.8 million going to <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts said the buyout also removes some potential roadblocks to <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> acquiring other banks or thrifts as the state's troubled financial industry is cleaned Since entering the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> market, <ORGANIZATION> NCNB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has sold $ 410 million worth of additional stock and seen its stock price climb to over $ 54 a share, more than double its share price on July 29, 1988, when the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> announced the deal.

 A subsidiary of one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest publicly held companies Wednesday announced a $ 280 million cash offer for <ORGANIZATION> Anchor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Container </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, mired in its second year of losses after a rapid rise to become <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No. 2 glass maker. The subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Vitro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> has offered $ 20 a share for the Tampa-based company. The Vitro subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> THR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and its affiliates already own 1.43 million shares of Tampa-based Anchor, or about 10.3 percent of shares outstanding. Stock in Anchor Glass shot up more than 60 percent Wednesday, gaining $ 7.50 a share to close at $ 19.75 in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, chief executive officer of the Mexican glass maker, said the takeover could erase financial difficulties at Anchor. `` We believe that our financial, technological and management resources can reverse what has been a significant decline in Anchor's operating results and financial position,'' <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said in a letter to <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naimoli </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of Anchor. `` We are prepared to make the substantial capital expenditures required for Anchor's business to reverse this decline.'' Anchor has blamed its losses on restructuring costs and a downturn in the glass container industry. In 1988, Anchor company posted a loss of $ 8.5 million and closed two plants. So far this year it has lost $ 14.4 million. This January, Anchor announced a 5 percent price increase on its products due to higher raw material costs. Vitro's cash-tender offer expires at midnight Sept. 7. `` Right now the official word from the company is no comment,'' said Anchor spokeswoman <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Villanova </PERSON>. Anchor manufactures glass containers for the brewing, food, soft drink, distilled spirits and wine industries. In 1987, it acquired competitor <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Bathhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for nearly $ 191.3 million. Corning Glass Works in <LOCATION> Corning </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is the nation's largest glass manufacturer, but does not specialize in bottles or containers. Vitro, headquartered in <LOCATION> Monterrey </LOCATION>, manufactures glass and plastic containers, flat glass, major appliances, tableware and glass-making machinery. In 1988, the company earned over $ 150 million on revenues of almost $ 1.1 billion. It has about 8,000 shareholders and is one of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s largest employers, with more than 37,000 employees. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Palm </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the $ 20-per-share offer appears reasonable considering the uncertainty in the glass container industry. `` Shipments of glass containers have been down seven of the last eight years and they are only up this year modestly,'' said <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION>. The Mexican company is also seeking to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Latchford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The tender offer for Anchor is not conditioned on the acquisition of <LOCATION> Latchford </LOCATION>.

 Brimming storage tanks of gasoline that should be almost empty are teaching oil companies an old economics lesson this summer: When prices rise, consumers buy less. The cost of gasoline, which soared 20 cents or more this spring in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez oil spill and widespread predictions of shortages, has been stabilizing and even dropping in some places because of a surprising oversupply at the height of the driving season. `` Major oil companies expected people were more indifferent to prices than they actually turned out to be,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Veno </PERSON>, director of oil market analysis for <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, an economic research concern. `` They would n't have wanted to raise prices so much as to undermine demand and they've tended to do that.'' Not only are motorists making fewer trips to the filling station, they're also buying cheaper grades of gasoline, industry statistics suggest. The result is that instead of shortages there are surpluses, especially of high-priced high-octane premium. That does n't mean demand could n't pick up _ there's still a good month's worth of summer vacation season left. More gasoline consumption could alter the supply-demand equation and prices could start rising. But as of late last month, the average retail price for all types of gasoline had dropped to $ 1.13 a gallon from a peak $ 1.18 a gallon on May 19, according to statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a research group that tracks gasoline prices nationwide. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which monitors the inflation rate, estimates the average price per gallon for all grades of motor fuel soared from 94.4 cents in January to $ 1.15 in June, a 22 percent gain. High octane, which averaged about $ 1.09 in January, rose 19 cents to $ 1.28 a gallon in June. Unleaded regular, the most widely consumed grade, rose from about 92 cents a gallon to $ 1.11. `` When prices of gasoline went up people bought less but more important they started buying cheaper grades,'' says <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eklof </PERSON>, an energy specialist with the consulting group <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. `` When the customer switches and downgrades it increases the overall supply in total.'' Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, an industry trade publication, reported recently that premium unleaded sales have fallen at least 10 percent because of motorists switching to regular unleaded. Wholesale prices are down even more sharply than retail, in some cases below levels last seen two years ago. That could translate into even lower retail prices in coming months. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> price of wholesale regular unleaded, for example, fell from 78 cents a gallon in late April to about 51 cents a gallon earlier this month. Overestimates of summer driving and concern about supply disruptions caused by the Exxon oil spill led refiners to make too much gasoline, analysts say. `` What happened is that people altered their plans,'' says <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, executive director of the Service Station Dealers of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>. `` So the big usage did n't materialize and now we have a glut of refined product on the market. If the price falls that much it has to be a tremendous oversupply.'' Predictions of shortages arose from a number of other causes. Tougher federal antipollution regulations, for example, require refineries to use more crude in making gasoline. Refinery accidents, maintenance delays, and lower production from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> fields also played a role But the biggest shot to the market psyche was the Exxon oil spill. The March 24 disaster in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> jolted the market because the cleanup temporarily disrupted the flow of crude to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> refiners, raising the possibility of shortages. Refiners responded by reducing sales to customers. Almost overnight, prices rocketed, with wholesale premium gasoline up 30 cents in some parts of the country. In <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, for example, regular unleaded surged to $ 1.07 on April 5 from 74 cents the day of the spill. The price shock quickly rippled through the country. In the end, shipments from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> were disrupted for days instead of weeks. About 13 million barrels of southbound crude was delayed, in addition to the 250,000 barrels lost from the leaking <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> tanker. Moreover, refinery repairs and accidents had not caused other delays anticipated earlier. Refinery capacity turned out to be greater than expected and refiners were better prepared to handle the new antipollution requirements. After the spill, crude oil prices stabilized in the $ 19 - $ 20-a-barrel range until last month, when they slid to about $ 18 in response to the softening gasoline market and a surge in summer production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries Refiners are just starting to slow production while the surplus dwindles. But that means crude oil stockpiles are growing. `` It's a double-edged sword. If refiners do n't cut back there's too much product If they do then there is too much crude,'' says <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, energy analyst at <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Whether late-summer vacationers will reduce the oversupply of gasoline remains unclear. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks summer driving, had predicted a 4 percent increase this year over last but now says that growth is unlikely. `` It is fair to say that gasoline prices have had an impact on gasoline consumption and driving habits as well,'' says <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheske </PERSON>, spokesman for AAA. `` Whether people canceled vacations I do n't think so. They're just more conservative in their driving habits.'' Some analysts believe consumers have sent a clear message to oil companies. `` The lesson oil companies are learning is that you ca n't go and raise prices by 20 percent and not expect something to happen,'' <PERSON> Veno </PERSON> says. `` It's a big lesson.''

 Lottery giant <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday it has agreed to a $ 290 million buyout by about a dozen members of management and a unit of the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The price tag includes roughly $ 160 million for <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION>'s stock and $ 130 million for payment of fees, refinancing of <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION>'s debts and a contribution to working capital. The top managers, including <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON>, the chairman and chief executive, and <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Markowicz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION>'s vice chairman, will retain their positions in the company, <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> said. The purchase price was $ 16.62 -LCB- per share in cash. <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 75 cents a share to $ 16 in over-the-counter trading on Wednesday. The price had been inflated before the announcement by speculation of a possible acquisition. The company has nearly 10 million shares outstanding. <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION>, a leading supplier worldwide of on-line computerized lottery networks, currently serves 35 customers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere, including <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. If the recently approved sports betting in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> spreads to other states, <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> would be `` a major beneficiary from this spread,'' since the sports betting would use the same machines as the existing lotteries, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritger </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dillon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> is going to continue on in the lottery business as is,'' <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Wednesday `` We are a leader in the business and we aim to stay a leader.'' The merger was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> board on Tuesday but requires approval from <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> shareholders at a meeting later this year. <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> said the meeting would be held in the fall but he would not say precisely when. The company noted that the agreement depends on completion of financing and on certain government approval and assurances from some lottery authorities to continue <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION>'s contracts. Rumors of a possible <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> takeover surfaced last October, prompting <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> to issue a statement saying the company had an `` open-door policy'' and would consider offers. In early May, <ORGANIZATION> Gtech </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that certain parties had expressed an interest in acquiring the company. Also in May, the company announced the establishment of a special committee to evaluate possible business combinations. The committee consisted of directors and financial advisors from <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> declined Wednesday to talk about the outside interest, other than saying `` we were talking to a lot of people about a lot of things. <PERSON> Snowden </PERSON> said last year he felt an unfriendly takeover was unlikely, since any disruption of the company's top management team would wreck most of its contracts, in both logistical and legal terms.

 The dollar turned narrowly mixed Wednesday against key foreign currencies in sluggish trading. Gold prices were also mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 366.90 a troy ounce from $ 366.20 late Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid for gold at $ 366 an ounce, up $ 1.70. Currency dealers said concerns of slow economic growth brought a soft tone to the market. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> released its regular bank survey of economic conditions, known as its `` beige book,'' on Wednesday, and that showed the economy was still growing but at a slower pace.

<HEAD>Corn Prices Lower, Soybeans, Wheat Climb Before USDA Crop Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn futures were lower, but soybeans and wheat prices finished higher Wednesday as traders hewed to narrow ranges in advance of a much-anticipated <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> survey of crop production for the year. On other markets, sugar futures surged on rumors that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was in the market for as many as 300,000 tons; heating oil led a modest run-up in the petroleum futures complex; and frozen pork belly prices continued sliding in the face of historically high inventories. Corn came under pressure with the opening bell at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> because of the unusually high crop production estimate _ 7.72 billion bushels _ released after the close of trading Tuesday by influential private forecaster <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>. Although <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s forecast for soybeans was high as well _ 1.95 billion bushels _ most traders apparently felt that was discounted during the late wave of selling Tuesday that dragged November soybeans to yet another contract low. Traders tested the contract low at $ 5.62 again early Wednesday. After support held above that mark, many traders squared up their positions and headed to the sidelines to await Thursday's government report `` The confusion between <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON>'s numbers and what the traders were looking for pulled the market the past two days,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` I think people were happy just to even up and wait and see what the official numbers look like.'' Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 5 cents higher, with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.95 a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 2 cents lower, with September at $ 2.23 a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents lower to unchanged, with September at $ 1.36 a bushel; soybeans were 1 -LCB- cents to 9 cents higher, with August at $ 5.94 a bushel Rumors of a big purchase by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, which some traders speculated may already have taken place, pushed sugar futures prices above 14 cents a pound at mid-session. `` That number has psychological value and it got some people excited enough to jump on the bandwagon,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Sugar supplies have been tight for a while and a report of somebody coming in and taking that much out of the market was bound to spur a rally.'' Late profit-taking helped trim the gains, however, and sugar finished .05 cent to .26 cent higher on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION>, Sugar and <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with October at 14.07 cents. An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report released after Tuesday's trading showed a substantial drawdown in heating oil supplies last month and that lifted the entire complex Crude oil was 9 cents to 14 cents higher at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with September at $ 18.21 a barrel; heating oil was .66 cent to .96 cent higher, with September at 49.43 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .14 cent to .40 cent higher, with September at 50.58 cents a gallon. Livestock futures were mostly lower, while pork futures were sharply lower at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .35 cent lower to .27 cent higher, with August at 74.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .33 cent higher, with August at 84.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .33 cent to 1.23 cents lower, with August at 46.77 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to 1.13 cents higher, with August at 24.92 cents a pound. Precious metals were mixed. Gold prices climbed 10 cents to 70 cents on the Comex, with August at $ 366.90 a troy ounce; silver slipped 1 cent to 3 cents, with August at 515.5 cents. Platinum, traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, was $ 1 to $ 1.80 lower, with September at $ 484.70 a troy ounce.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock rose in active trading Wednesday on speculation that the company that launched an unsuccessful $ 12.2 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was itself a takeover target. Paramount rose $ 2.50 to $ 62.12 -LCB- a share and was the second most actively traded issue on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as more than 4.1 million of its shares changed hands. Paramount stock rose $ 2.62 -LCB- a share on Tuesday. Paramount, the one-time conglomerate that has been selling assets outside its entertainment and publishing businesses under Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said it `` does not comment on market activity, rumors or speculation.'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Logdson </PERSON>, who follows Paramount for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Crowell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weedon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, said the activity in <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s stock reflected the `` swirl of rumors'' about possible suitors for the company. Among those mentioned have been <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ a media concern that is a major shareholder in <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ and an investor group led by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based cable television company. Columnist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorfman </PERSON> said in Wednesday's edition of <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> that a group of investors led by <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> had acquired a stake in <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and may seek control. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> was said to be out of the country and unavailable for comment. <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carey </PERSON> said, `` It is our policy neither to confirm nor deny any speculation about a possible acquisition.'' Two calls placed to Chris-Craft were not returned. Paramount recently tried but failed with an eleventh-hour hostile bid for Time, which had earlier agreed to a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Paramount offered $ 10.7 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and later raised its offer to $ 12.2 billion, but <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> deflected the bid by insisting it was not for sale and amending its stock-swap merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> into a $ 14 billion <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> buyout. Paramount failed to win a fight in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> state courts to block the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger and dropped its bid July 24. Late last month, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said it had agreed to sell its consumer and commercial finance unit, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, for $ 3.35 billion to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. But some analysts said the sale of the unit that accounted for 46 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s operating income in 1988, coupled with an expected infusion of cash, could make <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> more attractive to bidders.

 Oil futures prices rose Wednesday on news that refineries pumped less gasoline last week. West Texas Intermediate for September delivery rose 9 cents on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and finished at $ 18.21 a barrel. WTI sets the standard in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry for light, sweet crude oil. Contracts for later delivery of <ORGANIZATION> WTI </ORGANIZATION> posted slightly higher gains. Domestic heating oil traded on the exchange showed the biggest gains. The contract for September rose 0.87 cent to 49.43 cents a gallon while October rose 0.92 cent to 50.16 cents. September unleaded gasoline finished 0.14 cent higher at 50.58 cents a gallon while other contracts also advanced. Statistics from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> showed that crude oil runs at refineries fell by 500,000 barrels last week, while distillate, or heating oil, runs declined by 100,000 barrels. The figures suggest that refineries, which have operated at the highest levels in a decade, slowed their output of gasoline and heating oil. Energy analysts said that those statistics helped offset what could have been a negative impact from the same API report, which showed that supplies of crude oil, gasoline and heating oil in storage all rose during the same week ended Aug. 4. Gasoline prices have softened in recent weeks as supply exceeded demand and inventories increased. Crude prices also have weakened recently due to the surge in summer output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and sluggish demand. Analysts said the new API data might lead investors to believe that market fundamentals are improving. `` It's too early to say if this is the beginning of a sustained rally,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Lebow </PERSON>, senior broker for <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It could be that traders will be looking ahead to heating oil season.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> can begin a $ 350 million debt refinancing to be paid for largely through its Park Place Casino in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, state regulators ruled Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> rejected arguments from state gaming officials that the refinancing would put Park Place, one of <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s leading gaming halls, on shaky financial footing. `` I find that this is a responsible proposal which will not jeopardize Park Place's financial stability or its ability to maintain a first-class facility,'' commission chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION>, the casino's Chicago-based parent company, wants to make Park Place more independent. The refinancing plan includes offering $ 350 million in mortgage notes to fund a $ 150 million dividend payment to <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> and retire existing corporate debt. The casino would incur the $ 350 million debt. About $ 120 million would be used by the parent firm to retire debt unrelated to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> ventures. Read admitted the proposal would increase Park Place's debt without an equal benefit to the casino. But he said he is `` satisfied that the proposed transaction is responsible and is not a plan to siphon funds from a healthy facility and leave it in a weakened state. Nor does it mark the beginning of a withdrawal by -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming market.'' Read said <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> has invested more than $ 600 million in Park Place while receiving just $ 43 million in dividends and plans to spend $ 213 million more on capital improvements. Dissenting commissioner <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> and state Division of Gaming Enforcement officials argued that the casino will have problems paying off the debt despite promises by <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> officials. Waters said the plan `` merely reshuffles financing to <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` It in no way benefits the Park Place,'' he said. `` The facility is basically self-financing. Its future ability to be self-financing is inhibited.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummis </PERSON> said the restructuring plan would begin soon, but he was not more specific.

<HEAD>Brazil Denies Moratorium On Interest Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance Minister <PERSON> Mailson </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said Wednesday the nation's foreign creditors have agreed to a delay in debt payments and he denied <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> will enter a moratorium. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> told the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that the government wanted to avoid a confrontation with creditors and wished to `` negotiate lateness'' until the country's foreign reserves reached a `` respectable level.'' In July, the government restricted the outflow of dollars by channeling all foreign exchange operations through the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, equivalent to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. Since then, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s cash reserves have risen nearly $ 1 billion to $ 6.5 billion, surpassing the minimum level considered safe by the government, which is $ 6 billion, equivalent to four months of imports. But the government continues to hold back about $ 1 billion in debt payments since June 30, including $ 400 million to Western government leaders due July 3 and some $ 600 million in interest payments and dividend remittances by foreign multinationals, <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said. That falls short of a moratorium, which would be a total halt to payments on foreign debt. <PERSON> Da </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobrega </PERSON> said the government needed the reserves to avoid shocks from abroad and insure a smooth transition of government during the coming months. On Nov. 15, Brazilians will elect President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>'s successor in the nation's first people's vote in 29 years The winner will take office on Mar. 15, 1990. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, tottering under a $ 112 billion foreign debt, the Third World's largest, is also seeking fresh money to meet an interest payment of $ 3 billion due in September to private foreign banks. The government is negotiating an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> that would allow <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to receive $ 4 billion in fresh loans withheld by private banks and lending organizations. Creditors have balked at lending more money to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, which has not controlled an annual inflation rate of 1,000 percent, monetary expansion and a soaring public defecit. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s public deficit, running at around 7 percent of GNP this year, is one of the principal generators of inflation.

 A group of retired <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> salaried employees has sued the automaker, claiming <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> broke health-care promises and owes them money they should n't have had to pay. The group of 114 retired employees said in the suit filed in a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> federal court Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cut their health-care coverage after promising them the items would be covered. The suit, filed as a class action on behalf of more than 80,000 retired <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> salaried workers, most of whom live in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, seeks reinstatement of the cut benefits and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses they have spent. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said company officials had no comment on the suit since they have n't had time to study it. <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON> said all salaried <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> workers should have known their health care benefits could change. She said changes were made to encourage active and retired employees to switch to more economical health care plans, such as health maintenance organizations. Last year, the company eliminated or reduced some coverage for the retirees, including chiropractic and psychiatric care, and imposed copayments and deductibles on basic health coverage. `` <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said we would have these benefits for our lifetimes,'' said <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moeller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, an accountant who retired in 1982. `` I felt we had a moral our years in jail, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. It said that the three would be prosecuted, but did not elaborate. The official Mexican news agency <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> said the three were arrested Sunday and legal proceedings began Wednesday in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> provincial court. The agency gave no word on the trial. In a dispatch from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Notimex </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION> as saying the three were of `` known counterrevolutionary affiliation'' and `` carried out a campaign of slander'' in statements to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television and `` the anti-Cuban radio sponsored by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' a reference to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's Radio <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, saying, `` I'm proud to sign this monster,'' Wednesday put his signature on a $ 159 billion rescue package for the savings-and-loan industry. With the ink barely dry on the 371-page rewrite of federal banking laws, his administration began putting the plan into effect, approving the first $ 815 million installment for cleaning up the nation's most heavily indebted savings and loans. Hours after the signing, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the new federal agency created to dispose of ailing thrifts, said it was considering unilaterally reducing high interest rates on long-term certificates issued by some of 262 insolvent but still open thrift institutions. `` The bill is not perfect, but it is a first step, a crucial first step toward restoring public confidence,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at a Rose Garden bill-signing ceremony attended by the chief architects of the legislation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the overhaul _ the government's biggest-ever industry bailout _ will help `` ensure that not one dollar of insured funds will be lost by any depositor.'' The legislation, a lightly modified version of the rescue plan <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first submitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Feb. 6, authorizes $ 50 billion in new government borrowing over the next 26 months to clean up ailing S & amp; Ls, in part by buying up high-rate certificates of deposit issued by the shaky thrifts to attract capital. The measure requires S & amp; L owners, within four months, to have $ 1.50 in tangible capital for every $ 100 in lending as a cushion between future losses and government insurance funds. By 1995, the standard will tighten to $ 3 for each $ 100 in loans. The overhaul also toughens criminal penalties for fraud and triggers the most sweeping overhaul of the banking regulation in 50 years. This includes a dismantling of the primary <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulatory agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Under the overhaul, <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls will be provided by a new insurance fund called the <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funds </ORGANIZATION>, SAIF, pronounced `` safe.'' Shortly after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed the bill, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> convened a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Oversight Board, set up by the legislation to sell off sour loans and repossessed real estate the government is inheriting from the failed thrifts. The board voted to spend $ 815 million as the first installment in shutting down or merging S & amp; Ls with the highest negative net worths, including $ 215 million for dealing with three yet to be identified insititutions on Thursday. The government, which has already closed 223 S & amp; Ls, is authorized under the legislation to shut down up to 500 more of the nation's nearly 3,000 institutions over three years It is required to spend $ 20 billion over the next seven weeks alone on the problem. Of that $ 20 billion, $ 15 billion will be used to replace deposits lost to institutions as high-rate certificates, most with 30 -, 60 - and 90-day terms and some paying up to 11 percent interest, come The <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said those certificates could be renewed, but at interest rates up to 3 percentage points under what they are now earning, and expects some of the certificate money to be withdrawn. Unresolved is whether the corporation will continue to honor the high interest rates on longer-term certificates, as the bank board had. At issue are long-term certificates issued by 262 institutions the federal government has already taken over but has not had the money to redeem. Those institutions' high-rate certificates total $ 50 billion, but only a small portion of them are long-term, according to analysts. The resolution corporation is expected to decide within the next few days how to honor the certificates. Latest administration estimates put the total cost of the bailout at $ 159 billion through 1999. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the measure, which received final congressional approval Saturday, `` says to tens of millions of savings and loan depositors: you will not be the victims of others' mistakes.'' In a reference to the nearly foot-thick `` Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989'' resting on a table awaiting his signature, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Thank you all very much and, now, I'm proud to sign this monster.'' Among the 300 or so people at the signing ceremony were <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> and key <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> backers of the legislation, including Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairmen of the congressional banking committees <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> later told reporters, `` The bill deals with every major problem we were able to identify.'' He praised the administration for moving to put the plan into effect so quickly. Some analysts expect that government buyouts and mergers with commercial banks will leave only 1,000 or so savings and loans still in business at the end of five years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the legislation `` comes to grips with the problems facing our savings and loan industry. It will safeguard and stabilize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s financial system and put in place permanent reforms so these problems will never happen again.'' The bill includes punishments for fraud committed by officers and directors of financial institutions of up to $ 1 million a day in fines and 20 years in prison. `` Those who try and loot the savings of their fellow citizens deserve, and will receive, swift and severe punishment,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 Twelve traders in the Japanese yen pit at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges stemming from the federal probe of trading practices at the world's largest futures markets The 12 were among 46 traders named a week ago in the first indictments resulting from the undercover investigation. Charges ranged from pre-arranged trading to racketeering conspiracy and tax fraud, most alleging schemes in which traders pocketed profits from trades made for customers while passing their own losses on to customers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovich </PERSON> set Aug. 16 as the next hearing date for the 12 traders. The judge said he would set a trial date at that time. Five of the traders _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 50, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cali </PERSON>, 38, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crouch </PERSON>, 43, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Pace </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 34 _ pleaded innocent to charges of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as to multiple counts of mail and wire fraud. The remaining seven traders pleaded innocent to charges of mail and wire fraud. Published reports have said that as many as 30 defendants are expected to plead guilty and cooperate with authorities. Three of the 21 traders indicted at the yen pit at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> pleaded guilty Tuesday. The remaining 25 defendants traded in the Swiss franc pits at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, and in the soybean and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond pits at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The indictments were handed up Aug. 2. In the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe, agents posed as traders on the floors of the two exchanges and tape-recorded illegal transactions. More indictments are expected this fall as a result of the continuing investigation. The first traders to be arraigned in the case pleaded guilty Tuesday to fraud and Commodities Exchange Act violations. As part of their plea agreements, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Braniff </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sledz </PERSON>, admitted to making pre-arranged trades among themselves and other indicted traders. They have agreed to make restitution to customers, and face prison terms and stiff fines from the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. All have been banned from the exchange.

 A nationwide video rental chain agreed not to photocopy instruction manuals for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> games its stores were renting out, according to court papers filed Wednesday. Nintendo of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Redmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, last week sued the chain, <ORGANIZATION> Blockbuster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, charging copyright infringement. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> said he chain of 600 stores was frequently copying the booklets and charging renters a fee if the manuals were lost. The Japanese video game company submitted 6 inches of legal papers with its complaint, most of them booklets and copies. The lawsuit specifically named four stores in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, allowing the case to be filed here. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> charged that Blockbuster ignored its request in a July 31 letter to stop the practice. In a statement released Wednesday by Blockbuster, the chain said it had already told its managers not to copy the manuals. Both sides agreed to a court order filed Wednesday by U.S. District Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolin </PERSON>. The order also requires Blockbuster within five days to send a letter drafted by <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyers warning its franchises and managers not to copy manuals.

 <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest cellular telephone company, said Wednesday its second-quarter loss widened to $ 87.5 million from $ 61.7 million a year ago. But Chairman and Chief Executive <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said the losses `` are consistent with company expectations since many of our cellular markets remain in their start-up phase.'' Costs for acquisitions, construction, interest, marketing and depreciation are expected to remain high as the company builds its cellular operations, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said. However, he said operating margins are improving as the number of cellular subscribers grows. Revenue for the quarter rose 64.3 percent to $ 120.1 million from $ 73.1 million a year earlier. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> has made a hostile tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based cellular telephone, television broadcasting and publishing company. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> has offered $ 110 a share for the 90.2 percent of <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s stock it does n't already own, or about $ 5.4 billion. LIN says the offer, which <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> has extended until Sept. 1, is inadequate. For the first six months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 185.2 million on revenue of $ 222.2 million in contrast to losses of $ 123.1 million on revenue of $ 141.1 million for the same period of 1988. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> provides cellular telephone service in a number of major markets, including <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. It said the number of cellular subscribers in its markets and in markets where it has the right to buy a controlling interest increased by 30 percent to 336,000 as of June 30, from 258,000 at the end of 1988.

 Union and <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> representatives expressed little optimism Wednesday for an early end to a walkout that has slowed some telephone services in six states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> since Sunday. Strikes also continued against <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. In all, about 157,000 union workers in 15 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> were on strike, forcing management to work long hours in such jobs as answering directory assistance queries and making limited repair calls. In a statement Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> urged the public, union members and their families not to pay their phone bills until the strikes at <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Telesis </LOCATION> are settled. The resolution was passed Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> Executive Council, according to a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> were not scheduled to meet Wednesday, but had a negotiating session set for Thursday, a company spokesman said. No progress was made in their first face-to-face, post-strike meeting Tuesday, both sides agreed. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bickers </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It appears that the company has a time lag, and this may very well stall things. It's certainly not helping the process.'' Another <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gathers </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, added, `` Nothing has changed, really, since Sunday.'' `` There is some slowness in getting directory assistance and in operator assistance for toll calls in our area of service,'' said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Duddy </PERSON>. `` But everything else which is automated is working fine,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, police on Wednesday arrested at least 35 striking telephone workers blocking entrances to headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> NYNEX </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, and a contractor's garage. They were arraigned on disorderly conduct charges and released on their own recognizance. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> reported that lines were cut in five communities serving about 2,000 customers.

 Slashing the federal budget deficit would dramatically improve the nation's $ 129 billion annual trade imbalance, congressional fiscal experts said Wednesday. The non-partisan <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said that by meeting the deficit targets mandated by the Gramm-Rudman law _ which requires a balanced federal budget by 1993 _ the country's trade shortfall could be cut by $ 40 billion to $ 65 billion Many economists agree that reducing federal red ink would help the trade imbalance. But by producing its 77-page report, which relies on simulations to make its arguments, <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> provided more ammunition to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pressing for a fiscal 1991 budget deal with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> that would entail major deficit cuts. The congressional agency estimated that eventually, every $ 1 billion cut in the federal deficit would improve the nation's trade picture by $ 300 million to $ 500 million. The <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> also said that expanding the money supply would have little effect on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, since exchange rates are flexible. `` Among the options policymakers have for reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account deficit, reducing the federal budget deficit ... is the most promising,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> said. The current account deficit is the broadest measure of the trade deficit, registering not only products but services as well. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> current account deficit reached $ 132 billion last year and is expected to be about $ 129 billion this year. At the beginning of this decade, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had a slight surplus in trade. To pay for the extra goods and services entering this country, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must borrow money from abroad. `` In the long run, this borrowing will transfer wealth abroad and this will reduce living standards of Americans in the future,'' <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reischauer </PERSON> said at a news conference. Economists disagree over how threatening the trade imbalance is. Some say it bodes ill because it could trigger protectionist legislation and recession, while others argue it means little. But they mostly agree that cutting the federal deficit would ease the trade shortfall by lowering the need to borrow from abroad, reducing interest rates, allowing the dollar to decline and thus making American products more attractive to foreign buyers. The budget deficit for fiscal 1989 _ which ends Sept. 30 _ is expected to be about $ 148 billion. The Gramm-Rudman law's deficit ceiling for next year is $ 100 billion, and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will resume its efforts to reach that target when it returns from its summer recess in September. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the <ORGANIZATION> CBO </ORGANIZATION> conclusions `` emphasize the urgency of agreeing upon a bold deficit reduction package for fiscal year 1991 as soon as possible.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is seeking buyers for its data communications and personal computer divisions after an $ 85.2 million restructuring intended to streamline operations, the defense and aerospace contractor said Wednesday. The company, which began to scale down in the mid 1980s, is now organized into four major sectors: electronics, semiconductors, communications and <ORGANIZATION> Lanier </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the new name of its Harris-3M international division. `` The businesses we are selling are outside the mainstream of our future interests, and their sale will release assets and other resources for ... our core businesses,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartley </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, in a press release. The release did not name a price for the two divisions or whether any companies have expressed interest in them. The restructuring cost dropped net income for the year ended June 30 nearly 80 percent, while sales and per-share profit rose. For the 12 months ended June 30, the Melbourne-based company reported net income of $ 21.3 million, or 55 cents a share, on sales of $ 2.2 billion, compared with net income of $ 100.5 million, or $ 2.50 a share, on sales of $ 1.8 billion for the previous fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, the restructuring costs led to a net loss of $ 52 million on sales of $ 768.3 million, compared with net income of $ 1.8 million, or 5 cents a share, on sales of $ 471.8 million in the year-ago period. In June, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> pleaded no contest to filing inflated statements on behalf of a Filipino businessman convicted of defrauding the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> agreed to pay $ 200,000 in fines and $ 300,000 to settle civil claims against it arising from a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of fraud involving weapons sales to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Vacates Favorable Pickens Ruling In Phillips Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court Wednesday set aside a decision clearing corporate raider <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' investment group of violating securities and racketeering laws in a takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> five years ago. A three-judge panel of the 3rd <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> vacated a lower court's summary judgment in favor of <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> and sent the case back to <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>. The lawsuits brought by <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> shareholders accused <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> deception </ORGANIZATION> in its $ 9.1 billion attempt to take over the <LOCATION> Bartelsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, oil giant. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>, an attorney for <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, said from <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, that he had not seen the decision and would not comment. The court ruled a jury could reasonably conclude that <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, which made $ 89 million on the takeover attempt, had always intended to sell its <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> stock back to the company for a better deal than the other stockholders received. Such a tactic is known as `` greenmail.'' During the takeover attempt, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> repeatedly said <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> would not consider selling back its shares unless the same deal was offered to all stockholders. The partnership changed its stance when <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> adopted a `` poison pill'' strategy to fight the takeover. The appeals court said the district court incorrectly cited a lack of evidence. Although much of the evidence was circumstantial, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scirica </PERSON> wrote, no other type normally is available in bad-faith cases. `` A jury could reasonably conclude that the partnership either was reckless in making the equal-basis statements given the forseeability of what actually occurred or that the partnership intended from the outset of its tender offer to sell back to <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> on an unequal basis,'' <PERSON> Scirica </PERSON> wrote. The appeals panel upheld the summary judgment involving all <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> state charges.
