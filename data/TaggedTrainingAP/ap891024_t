 An infant abducted from a hospital pediatric ward was returned safely on Tuesday, about 24 hours after he was reported missing, and a woman who recently lost her own baby was arrested, authorities said. The infant, now 19 days old, appeared to have been well cared for and was in excellent condition, according to <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, was charged with kidnapping, police said. She was scheduled for a <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appearance on Wednesday. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> recently lost a baby of her own and desperately wanted another, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> Police Chief Deputy <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` She did have a child that she had lost,'' <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> said. `` Apparently, she had a cradle and all of the necessities that's needed to care for an infant. The baby, who was up for adoption, was taken by a woman posing as hospital volunteer, police said. Police spokesman <PERSON> Quintin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said detectives were led to Ms. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> after receiving tips from neighbors. Someone saw Ms. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> with a baby Tuesday, and knowing that she did n't have a child, called the police. She was arrested at her home, authorities said. Hospital officials said Tuesday new security measures were being considered. `` We are certainly going to take a look at some changes with regard to the check-in procedures and the identification of volunteers,'' Ms. <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, the television evangelist who lost his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> empire in a sex scandal, was sentenced to 45 years in prison and fined $ 500,000 Tuesday for defrauding his followers for his own enrichment. `` I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 49, said before he was sentenced by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>. `` I have sinned. But never in my life did I intend to defraud.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> shook his head in disbelief while a federal prosecutor presented arguments, as did his daughter, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, did not attend the court session. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> is nicknamed `` Maximum Bob'' after his reputation for harsh sentences, particularly in drug sentences. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had faced a maximum sentence of 120 years, but the judge consolidated the 24 fraud and conspiracy counts to nine and sentenced <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to five years on each. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be eligible for parole in 10 years. His lawyers said they would appeal, and despite defense pleas, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was immediately taken into custody and driven to the medium-security <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, about 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. In handing down the sentence, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said, `` I'm concerned about the hundreds of letters I have here from people who say they'd do anything for him and that could include preventing Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> from going to prison. I believe them.'' Because of that, he said, `` I think we're going to have to put him into custody.'' At that point, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s daughter broke into sobs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was put in a holding cell, then taken away in a government sedan to <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>. He arrived at the prison about 9:30 p.m. CDT and was led in handcuffs and shackles to the prison entrance. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> kept his eyes on the ground and did not comment as he was hustled inside surrounded by six guards. A prison official said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would probably be transferred to another prison in one or two weeks. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, said his client was `` in as good spirits as he can be under the circumstances. Of course, he's concerned about the lengthy sentence but he has strong faith, and will come through. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> said he had filed notice of appeal with the 4th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and would ask the court to free <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> on bond. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s sentence `` sends a message that you ca n't use TV and the mails to make fraudulent statements to get people to send money to you. This is a simple fraud case.'' <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, the former church secretary whose sexual tryst with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> led to the hush money scandal that caused him to lose control of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, said she was n't satisfied with the sentence. `` It can not repay those millions of dollars, and the years of work people did to make it, but at least it's a start,'' <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from her <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hollwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, home. `` At least people can feel like they wo n't be taken for fools `` How must they feel?'' she asked. `` The ones who gave millions, the people who took out loans? `` <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> supporter <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said the sentence was not fair. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s no crook. The news media made him look like one,'' she said. There was no sign of Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> or at the couple's home in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where the couple established a new church and television ministry Former defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said the sentence was `` pretty heavy ... for a white-collar criminal. That's pretty startling.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who was interviewed by telephone in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> while awaiting a flight to his home in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, said he asked <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to release him from the case before sentencing. Prosecutors did n't recommend a specific sentence, but asked <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> for a long sentence and a heavy fine, arguing that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has n't assumed responsibility for his crimes. The government also asked that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> be ordered to repay up to $ 100 million in money donated by followers. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> did not order <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to make restitution, saying that issue needed to be resolved in bankruptcy court. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, asked <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> to consider alternatives to prison `` and allow this defendant the benefit of the court's compassion and mercy.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was convicted Oct. 5 on 23 counts of fraud and one count of conspiracy for selling lodging guarantees at his Christian retreat when he knew there were n't enough rooms available. The jury, which began hearing the case Aug. 28, found that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> used more than $ 3.7 million of his followers' money to buy luxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations. Those who bought the lodging guarantees, called lifetime partners, sent him more than $ 158 million. The partners then were supposed to be entitled to three nights' lodging each year at the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> retreat at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> on March 19, 1987, amid a sex and money scandal involving Ms. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>. During the trial, which lasted nearly six weeks, defense attorneys called 75 witnesses, including more than 50 who were loyal <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> supporters. Prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses, including many lifetime partners who had sent money _ usually $ 1,000.

 Beneath a cracked steeple, people prayed and embraced. By a flattened freeway, children played in the setting sun. As bells tolled, a man stared at the shards of his old piano. It was 5:04 p.m., and <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> took a minute for reflection on a minute of fear. Exactly one week after the Oct. 17 earthquake, the sound of church bells filled <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Eimers </PERSON> returned to the ruins of his <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district apartment building, the focus of the <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> blimp's network camera as the structure blazed that night. `` I came back just to see. I wanted to get in and see what I could see, to put some kind of closure on the whole experience,'' <PERSON> Eimers </PERSON> said. His 1914 Steinway piano was barely discernible in the debris. Burned were 15 years of genealogical research on his family. Missing were his cats, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON>. `` I'm still pretty numb,'' he said. The bells' tolling surprised <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, who was talking with a friend on steps next door to the city's 200-year-old Mission Dolores church. At 5:04, they happened to be discussing the quake. `` I'm refeeling the fear and terror of not knowing if my brother and sister-in-law are safe,'' she said. `` The feeling the world's not safe to walk on. Down the coast in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Holy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is closed, a red tag marking a portal and the steeple cracked by the quake. `` We're not going to be saddened. We're going to rebuild, not out of fear but out of hope,'' Pastor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> said at an outdoor service at 5:04. Some of the 150 people present embraced, listening to readings from the Book of Genesis. All was quiet in <LOCATION> Candlestick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where light stands had shook and concrete had fallen in chunks a week before. At 5:04 Tuesday, construction workers were patching cracks, getting ready for Friday's restart of the World Series. They did n't seem to notice the time of day. It was sunset, and light winds wisped through the blue-collar neighborhood on the west side of sagging Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. Children played and giggled, regardless of the road's looming wreckage. Stopping his bike, an 8-year-old boy who gave his name only as <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> told how he'd watched as two men jumped and a truck fell from the buckling roadway a week earlier. At the <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> terminal of the <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, where Buck Helm worked before I-880 fell on him, the yellow panel truck that was his home during the week remained parked where it always was. The rundown alarm clocks inside were n't ticking at 5:04. `` It's about that time, is n't it?'' said <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a ship's clerk like <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> who spent the moment thinking of him and of how they'd left work around the same time that night `` A train was crossing a set of tracks and he had to stop. That's when I passed him going up to the freeway,'' said <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who saw the cloud of dust rise behind him from the collapse that would trap Helm for four days. `` I'm going home to celebrate. It's been one week. <PERSON> Momma </PERSON> has some of that apple juice with bubbles in it like champagne _ yeah, sparkling cider. I'll have a glass of sparkling cider.'' At 5:04 on Oct. 17, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> was 1 minute old. The quake shook the operating room where <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> had just given birth by Caesarean section. Nurses struggled to keep their balance and protect mother and baby. Precisely a week later, Mrs. <PERSON> Cupples </PERSON> wondered if an aftershock would mark the moment. As for <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, she nestled in her mother's arms, nursing.

<HEAD>Magnitude Raised to 7.1 After Additional Readings Studied</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The magnitude of the deadly earthquake that pelted <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> last week was increased from 6.9 to a 7.1 after seismologists studied additional monitoring charts, geophysicists said. The quake was recorded at 5:04 p.m. PDT on Oct. 17 and was blamed for the deaths of dozens of people, injuries to thousands and damage in excess of $ 7 billion. Besides altering the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale reading, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey altered the epicenter and focal depth. `` The revised magnitude was based on more clearly defined data that was recorded at 18 selected seismic stations all over the world,'' Waverly Person, director of the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said in a statement Tuesday. `` The original magnitude of 6.9 was based on more localized seismic readings,'' the statement sid. The temblor was the largest quake to occur along the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION> since the 1906 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> quake, <PERSON> Waverly </PERSON> said. That quake has been estimated at 8.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of ground motion, although monitoring equipment had not been invented at that time. Thousands of aftershocks have rattled the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Area </LOCATION> region in the week since the main quake. The epicenter of the quake was moved one mile northeast but was still in the <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prieta </LOCATION> area, said <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> Geophysicist <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON>. Geologically, the most significant change in readings was the focal depth, originally measured at 12 kilometers but now believed to have been 18 kilometers, <PERSON> Pitt </PERSON> said. `` You measure from the surface down. It started at a depth of 18 kilometers and broke upward horizontally,'' he explained.

 Rather than just write out a check, volunteers toil every day at the <ORGANIZATION> Harrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> warehouse, unloading emergency supplies, from toiletries to toys, donated from across the country. For many reasons, they drive to this two-story warehouse in the city's <LOCATION> South-of-Market </LOCATION> district to give their sweat and time, helping people they do not know at a time of great need. `` I did it for the feeling that I get,'' says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, 20, who came from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mateo </LOCATION> on his day off from a <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> store to help. <PERSON> Rodger </PERSON> <PERSON> Christopherson </PERSON>, 60, drove from his home in <LOCATION> Bevelry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, 300 miles south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, to do his part. He worked 12 hours on Sunday, including a supply trip to quake-ravaged <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>. Still, the self-employed screenwriter and novelist shrugs off the long hours. `` I think it's much better to have a first-hand experience,'' he says. A dozen volunteers shuttled about the 10,000-square-foot warehouse on Monday, sorting boxes and bags filled with sleeping bags, blankets, clothes, canned food and drinks. Stacked along one wall of the damp warehouse are boxes with some 6,800 loaves of bread delivered overnight by the owner of a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, bakery. Other walls are piled high with 10 - to 12-foot stacks of cereal, water, sodas and paper supplies Almost lost amid the supplies that litter the concrete floor is a single yellow toy truck. The toy is missing some parts, but it symbolizes the thousands of heartfelt gifts pouring in from all points. The public's generosity is not lost on the volunteers, such as <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Potrok </PERSON>, a 26-year-old sailor who came here with several other crew members of the San Diego-based U.S.S. <LOCATION> Schenectady </LOCATION>. `` With all the problems and stuff, you'd think people would be pretty tight. But people have been pretty good,'' says <PERSON> Potrok </PERSON>, as he sorts through a bag of clothes. Stories of good deeds are told and retold by volunteers. One found a hand-drawn, colored postcard inside a box of donated goods. Written in crayon, it said in child's printing: `` I hope you get your house back soon. <PERSON> Angie </PERSON>.'' And there's the story about the elderly woman who saved her money for a year to buy a nice down jacket, only to give it to a volunteer following the quake. `` She just said that she had open-heart surgery recently and it had taken her a year to buy it, and she felt that other people needed it more,'' recalls Major <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, divisional secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> oversees the volunteer organization at the warehouse. People have been good, he says. One gentleman stopped his car in front of the building, jumped out, and dropped off a television set. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> accepted a gift of 90,000 pounds of potatoes from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. A woman in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> told him Monday she was sending a shipment of five boxes of toiletries by airplane. `` People are just very generous,'' says <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, wearing a red sweater over his white <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> uniform. `` They're very concerned about the needs of other people.'' He said 1,400 volunteers have pitched in to help at the <LOCATION> Harrison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION> warehouse over the past four days. `` They've just been fantastic,'' says <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. <PERSON> Christopherson </PERSON>, the screenwriter-volunteer, was asked if he had any advice f or anyone thinking of volunteers. `` I think just to be aware of other people's suffering,'' he said, `` and do what their conscience tells them.''

 <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> likes to be where the action is when disaster strikes. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>'s wife wanted him out of her kitchen. Both retired, they are reservists for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> who help the agency stretch when the pressure is on. Last month they were helping victims of Hurricane Hugo. Now they're pulling 12-hours shifts at the Veterans Memorial Building in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> set up its disaster assistance center to handle applications for grants and low-interest loans. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 61, retired in June from the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, but has been a <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> reservist for three years. Before she retired, she saved up vacation time to work disasters. `` It's an organization that's there quickly and we like to be part of the action,'' said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who is assistant manager of the disaster assistance center here. <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>, 78, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a retired associated professor of agricultural engineering, has been a reservist 12 years. `` My wife said she married for better or worse, but not for lunch,'' said <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON>. `` She wanted to know, ` What are you going to do to stay out of my kitchen?''' Until recently, neither one had been sent to a disaster in more than a year and a half. On Sept. 1, <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, to a flood. Three weeks later, he was sent to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, for Hurricane Hugo. A day at home and he was in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to help open an earthquake disaster assistance center. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was packed and ready to go to the Grand Canyon on vacation with her husband, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> reservist now working in <LOCATION> Monterey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, when the call came Sept. 24 for <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. `` We split our clothes into two suitcases and off we went to <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>,'' she said. Three weeks later, they both were sent to help out with the quake. `` We had a beautiful spring and summer at home,'' she said. `` I have n't been home at all this fall.'' Both find getting their laundry done one of the biggest challenges. `` If you go to a Laundromat, that's an hour you could be sleeping,'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> said. Coast-to-coast diasters have stretched <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>, but it has n't snapped yet, said spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> `` I sure do n't want to see it strained much more, though,'' <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said. `` Right now I have laying on my desk a request for a disaster declaration from the state of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>,'' where flood damages are estimated at $ 12 million, <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said. `` We're about to find out whether we can -LRB- meet more demands -RRB- or not.'' The agency has 3,000 people assigned to Hurricane Hugo and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake, he said. Of them, only 200 are full-time <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> employees. Six hundred are regular reservists who have been trained in advance and are called up in time of need. The remaining 2,200 are hired locally and get one day of training before being thrown in the breach. Hurricane damage has accounted for 350,000 disaster aid applications from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, 8,000 from the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, 51,000 from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and 2,800 from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said. A week after the earthquake struck <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, 10,000 applications have come in from the 12 disaster centers in seven counties, said <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rhoda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. More than 400 people of various specialties from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> have been dispatched from around the country to verify disaster claims before <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> signs checks. The total number of applications from <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and the earthquake alone amount to more than three years' worth under normal ccircumstances, <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think our people would ever admit they have reached their limit. Somewhere down the line you will run out of manpower, but I do n't know where that is,'' he said. `` Do you put together an agency that is big enough to handle the current situation, then sit around and do nothing for a year? That's not very effecive.'' Instead, <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> lets people like <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> do the sitting around. `` I just sit at home and rock slowly'til they call me,'' <PERSON> Lytle </PERSON> said.

 Coffins were jostled and tombstones were toppled by the hundreds in graveyards when the earth groaned during last week's 7.1-magnitude earthquake. The <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and other religious icons, sentinals over a century-old graveyard near midtown here, tumbled to the ground and cemetery managers called off all burials until repairs can be made. `` Some of the marble monuments are shattered and they will be very difficult to repair. The granite ones we can stand up again, though,'' said <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Dias </PERSON>, manager for the five <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> County-operated cemeteries. The five cemeteries _ <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, Pioneer, <ORGANIZATION> Watsonville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and Day Valley _ hold 20,000 bodies dating to 1860. Hardest hit was <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boulevard </ORGANIZATION>. A huge pepper tree is the centerpiece of the two-acre garden of marble and granite where most graves bear the inscription: `` Rest in Peace.'' `` We suffered extensive damage to the upright stones in four cemeteries,'' said Dias. Valley Cemetery was spared damage because only flat markers are allowed. <PERSON> Dias </PERSON> said the cemeteries had received dozens of telephone calls from concerned relatives. Graveyard officials assured them repairs would be swift. <PERSON> Dias </PERSON> said cemetery workers were trying to clear away debris and repair damage. On a cold and rainy Tuesday one week after the disaster, there were no visitors in the cemetery. `` At this time we are holding off on burials to the end of the week,'' he said. `` We have holding vaults for them now.'' He estimated up to 500 markers were toppled in the quake that killed dozens, injured thousands and caused more than $ 7 billion in damage to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The aged <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemetery </ORGANIZATION> was littered with fractured madonnas and <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> statues. The face of a 3-foot-tall marble <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalen </PERSON> was buried in the grass. Ornate marble crosses were shattered to bits. Many concrete-covered gravesites were cracked. In some cases, there had been cave-ins. Well-manicured lawns surrounded family plots where concrete and plastic flowers were bleached by the sun and upended by the quake. The four-space <PERSON> Stolieh </PERSON> family crypt is only half full. The two empty crypts have shattered granite doors. An ornate, 10-foot-tall marble marker honoring <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dail </PERSON>, who died Jan. 31, 1888, toppled. The tombstone of <PERSON> Cary </PERSON> <PERSON> Freirmuth </PERSON>, who died in 1929, was upside down and in the mud.

 In 1956, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent tanks and soldiers into <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> to crush an anti-communist revolt. Now, with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> declaring itself a democracy and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> coping with its own internal turmoil, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is deafeningly quiet. With <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also absorbed in their own turbulent politics, it has been left to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s orthodox neighbors, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, to sound the communist alarm about the historic events in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>. Their concern is compounded by worries about the reaction of their own large ethnic Hungarian minorities, who were able to follow commemorations of the 1956 Hungarian uprising on live Hungarian television broadcasts Monday. A `` political coup d'etat,'' thundered the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda in <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION> on Monday, commenting on a historic parliamentary session in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> that rewrote the Hungarian constitution to embrace democracy and pave the way for free elections next year. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> so far has been silent about that session and Monday's rallies, in which more than 100,000 Hungarians cheered the proclamation of a democratic republic on the 33rd anniversary of their popular uprising But President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, perhaps the staunchest communist ideologue in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, last week denounced <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s path. He pledged <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> would never follow the same course toward a free market. At odds with <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> for years over charges that <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is harassing its 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> is bound to be further unsettled by the strident demands for democracy voiced in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Monday. A unique race in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with no linguistic bonds to neighboring Slavs and Germans, Hungarians have a tradition of maneuvering for the maximum freedom despite dominance by stronger neighbors. This history has also made them fiercely nationalistic, a pride that has not died in the extensive former Hungarian territories now incorporated in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s tough rule has so far kept ethnic Hungarian yearnings for more freedom from combining with widespread discontent at food and fuel shortages to ignite major outbreaks of unrest such as that which occurred in the <LOCATION> Transylvanian </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Brasov </LOCATION> in November 1987, when 10,000 angry workers took to the streets in protest. While <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> bristle, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> turns the other cheek. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s reticence toward the dramatic changes in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> confirm that President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, plagued by strikes and ethnic unrest at home, is sticking to his policy of non-interference in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Referring to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to disband and form a <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that espouses democratic ideals, Soviet East European expert <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> wrote in the Oct. 15 edition of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, `` Obviously, difficulties lie ahead. As it appears, the new party will be sailing in stormy and hazardous waters.'' <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> is credited with helping forge the new Soviet attitude toward its allies. In his commentary, he insisted on only one point: that Hungarians `` must n't question the existence of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact and their contacts'' within the Soviet trading bloc. Similar assurances from Solidarity labor leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> helped lead to the August nomination of non-communist Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reform-minded leaders hope to stave off the resounding defeat suffered by the Polish Communists in June elections, adopting a program of radical economic and political change in an effort to win popular support. However, the pace of change in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is so swift that opinion polls indicate its current leaders will at best be only partners in a coalition government after elections. The Soviets, and the rest of eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, will then have to deal with the implications of another ouster of communism through the ballot box.

<HEAD>Baker Calls for Sharp Reductions in First-Strike Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reducing first-strike nuclear weapons is the top goal set by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet negotiators trying to complete a new arms reduction treaty. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> singled out the deadliest missiles in superpower arsenals, capable of devastating an enemy in a surprise attack, during a speech Monday in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. He also urged the Soviets to join in a strategy shift to defense. `` We want to see Soviet defensive military operations made habitual,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in his first in-depth description of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's goals for negotiations under way in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to cut strategic weapons _ bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines _ on both sides. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would explore `` a cooperative and stable transition to a greater reliance on stability-enhancing, cost-effective strategic defense.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s emphasis on reducing first-strike weapons, such as Soviet SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, signals a subtle shift from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's stress on across-the-board strategic cuts. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> made no reference to the 30 percent to 50 percent cutback <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators have been aiming for in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks. Some analysts, such as former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, have urged greater emphasis on slashing first-strike weapons such as the Soviet SS-18s. Designed to destroy an adversary's ballistic missiles in their silos, first-strike nuclear weapons have a potential of wreaking havoc on the other side's nuclear forces. Former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> responded to a perceived Soviet threat by beginning a defensive program, known popularly as Star Wars, designed to destroy Soviet ballistic missiles in space before they could destroy their targets. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in his speech, encouraged the Soviets to concentrate their efforts on defense as well, while the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration pursues the Strategic Defense Initiative. He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goal in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks was `` a new relationship in which the capabilities and incentives to attack first are minimized and the possibilities of strategic defense are pursued.'' He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had tailored its proposals in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to emphasize the relative merits of slow-flying weapons, such as cruise missiles and bombers that are not suitable for a first strike. At the same time, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> urged a skeptical <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to approve a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> request for $ 100 million to produce mobile Midgetman missiles. Otherwise, he said, the Soviets could exploit differences between <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eliminated the request from the $ 305 billion defense authorization bill, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave its approval for the funds. A congressional conference committee is trying to reconcile this and other differences. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs now to support START, not undercut it, by funding this program,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had planned to speak to the private <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> on arms control last Thursday, but the speech was postponed because of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area earthquake.

<HEAD>Report Says DOE Downplayed Key Problems at Rocky Flats Arms Plant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Energy Department underestimated or ignored health and safety problems at the Rocky Flats nuclear arms plant as it gave the operator millions of dollars in bonus fees, federal auditors said today. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in the fiscal years 1986-88, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> won $ 26.8 million in award fees for running the plant, which has been under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation for alleged criminal violation of environmental laws since June. `` We believe that the seriousness of the -LRB- environmental, safety and health -RRB- problems ... were never conveyed in the evaluations'' of the plant's performance, the report concluded. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> announced last month that it was withdrawing from the plant, and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Oct. 11 that <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to take over Jan. 1. The plant makes plutonium triggers for nuclear warheads and is owned by the government. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report was being released today during a House Government Operations subcommittee hearing on <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> problems with the private companies that run major nuclear weapons facilities in 12 states under government contracts. Many of the contracts, including that at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION>, reimburse the company for all operating costs and allow bonus fees based on performance in key areas, including production of arms materials and compliance with health and safety rules. The fees are set during semiannual performance evaluations. Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the subcommittee, said Monday that the terms of the <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> contract made it difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to effectively manage the plant about 16 miles from downtown <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said the Rocky Flats problem was typical of management weaknesses throughout the nuclear weapons manufacturing complex, which includes 17 major plants. `` The department effectively has left itself no way to control the performance of its contractors or to hold them fully accountable for their actions,'' <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said the $ 26.8 million in bonus fees for <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> during the 1986-88 period represented 84 percent of the total awards possible under its contract. In this period, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s operations office in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, rated <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s health and safety performance as `` moderately good'' to `` excellent.'' The report said that while <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> rightly was applauded for holding down the number of work days lost due to injury, fire loss and property losses, some of its shortcomings in the health and safety area were underestimated or ignored. Among the problems downplayed by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, were an inadequate health physics program, repeated violations of environmental regulations and the `` questionable quality'' of the monitoring data used to comply with environmental laws. Under the Energy Department award fee system, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> was encouraged to increase production at Building 771, the main plutonium processing center, despite safety problems there. About two months before Building 771 was shut down due to safety problems in October 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> awarded <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> $ 310,000 for increased plutonium production, the report said. The building resumed production in January. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has substantially changed the terms of management contracts at some weapons facilities since he took office in March, and that further adjustments were planned.

 Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> says elected administration officials should have more influence over interest rate policies set by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a longtime critic of the nation's independent central bank, told the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> that he favors putting the treasury secretary on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> board and forcing it to announce its monetary policy decisions immediately. `` I believe sunlight on the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s operations is called for. I also believe the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> could use some input from the democratically elected executive branch,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said Monday. He endorsed legislation sponsored by Reps. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.D. </LOCATION>, that would require the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to release the decisions of its policymaking <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Open </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Market </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> immediately rather than waiting for six weeks, the current practice Originally, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> wanted to place the treasury secretary on the open market committee, which meets eight times a year to set interest rate and monetary policy. However, <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> has said he will modify the bill to instead require two meetings a year between the open market committee and senior administration officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, an independent body whose members are appointed by the president but ca n't be removed by him during their 14-year terms, has long been the target of critics who allege it favors high interest rates to fight inflation at the expense of jobs and economic growth. `` Interest rates are too high either by long - or short-term historical perspectives,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said `` I believe the best thing the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can do for the economy is to allow it to grow at a healthy rate by keeping interest rates down.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s comments follow statements in recent months from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his budget director, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, both of whom have pushed for lower interest rates. A housing secretary usually would not comment on monetary policy, leaving that to either the treasury secretary or the president's chief economic adviser. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, however, is a former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination who has a longstanding interest in the subject and has frequently criticized the central bank. The Hamilton-Dorgan bill is one of two measures that will receive a hearing Wednesday before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking subcommittee on domestic monetary policy. The other, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, is a resolution exhorting the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to set a target of reaching non-inflationary economic growth within five years. <PERSON> Neal </PERSON>'s resolution is supported by <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, who is scheduled to testify at the hearing.

<HEAD>Former HUD Official Says He Did Nothing Wrong in Advising Bush Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A former top housing official says he did nothing improper in providing campaign debate advice to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last year while administering a program now at the center of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandal. Former assistant housing secretary <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> provided debating points on housing, using documents from computer files in his office at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> and documents released by the department Monday under the Freedom of Information Act. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s contact with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign was Republican consultant <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>, who has admitted to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that he practiced `` influence-peddling'' at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> is a partner in a disputed <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> housing development that received more than $ 31 million in federal subsidies. He has acknowledged to congressional investigators that he lobbied <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> on more than 20 other projects. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, in an interview, said he did not believe <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used the debate material. In other documents, <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> said he delivered campaign speeches for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sometimes while traveling on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> business. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> administered the department's Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation program, which provided lucrative subsidy grants sought by developers, including <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manafort </PERSON>'s clients. Alleged abuses of the moderate rehabilitation program, including the steering of lucrative subsidy grants to politically favored developers, triggered further investigations of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs by congressional committees, and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it is investigating <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> activities across the nation. In the interview, <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> acknowledged providing tips for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s debates with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> He contended there was nothing improper about providing political advice while working at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> because he was a presidential appointee, named by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>.

The audit charged favoritism in the awarding of moderate rehabilitation grants and questioned his efforts to raise money from developers and others dealing with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for a favored charity, FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> contends others made the subsidy decisions and that his activities for the charity were proper. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s files contained letters he wrote to <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> last year defending his actions and questioning the investigation. He wrote one letter to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> complaining about the inspector general's investigation, but he said Monday he never mailed it. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s letter charged that his mail had been intercepted and the documents involving his personal finances eventually were obtained by the inspector general.

 <PERSON> Ericka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> say their only regret about their wedding day is they failed to catch the names of two strangers who returned a few thousand dollars in missing wedding gifts. The Howards, who were married Saturday, were about to leave the reception about 1 a.m. Sunday when an unknown man and woman drove up to the reception hall. The man asked if a bride named <PERSON> Ericka </PERSON> was in the group and then handed over all the cards with money the Howards had received as gifts earlier in the day. `` I could n't believe it,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said Monday. `` I just about died.''

 The billions of dollars that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> wants to give <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s earthquake victims will be used for a range of relief and recovery programs, from home-rebuilding loans to mental health counseling. Families whose homes are uninhabitable can seek money to pay for temporary housing, while special loans are available to small businesses that need quick capital and local governments can get aid in repairing public buildings and parks. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is rushing to approve a $ 2.85 billion aid package for the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area, and members say more money could come later. Shortly after the earthquake struck <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> a week ago, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signed a disaster declaration that freed up $ 273 million for emergency programs, but members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> immediately said a major aid package would be needed. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., estimated the damage at $ 7 billion, but said Monday that he did n't expect the federal government to pay that much Under some federal programs, the state of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will kick in 25 percent of the cost. Others are fully funded by the federal government. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>, which coordinates recovery programs, provided the following information about available programs. The amount of money spent on each program depends on how many applications are received.

<HEAD>Three Utilities Report Deals With Nuclear Workers</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least three electric utilities admit making deals with nuclear plant workers that could be seen as rewarding them for not reporting potential safety problems, government records show. All three companies insisted in letters to the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that the labor settlements were legal and proper, but they acknowledged some provisions might be viewed as `` silence-for-money'' deals. <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Parsippany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, disclosed the agreements in response to an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> inquiry last spring aimed at determining if such deals are common in the industry. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has criticized the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> for failing to explicitly outlaw such settlements. The controversy stemmed from a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> investigation last spring of two labor settlements between builders of the Comanche Peak nuclear power plant in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and workers who received payments in return for keeping quiet about potential safety hazards. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> later ruled that such settlement provisions were unacceptable, but the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> commissioners have been unable to agree how and whether to outlaw them. In April, the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> sent letters to all nuclear utilities and their contractors asking to be told of any labor settlements that restricted an employee's ability to report safety information to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. A review Monday of the written responses from the utilities and contractors showed all denied having any such restrictions. However, the three companies said they had settlements with provisions that might be construed by others as limiting a worker's ability to raise safety concerns <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Power </PERSON> was the only utility to provide specific information about a settlement. It said it felt compelled to report the case to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> `` in light of the sensitivity of the issue,'' even though it believes the settlement was proper. The case involves an April 21, 1988, settlement with former employee <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who filed a civil suit against <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> after he was dismissed in October 1983. In a passage similar to a provision of the Comanche Peak settlement, the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> settlement stipulated that <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> `` will not voluntarily appear as a witness'' in any legal or administrative proceeding involving <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. It also said he would not `` seek to induce any government agency'' to take any action against <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> these passages were designed to settle the <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> suit. The deal `` clearly left Mr. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> free ... to bring any concerns to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> ... if he so desired,'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> wrote to the commission. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> said it wrote to <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> in July saying he is free to bring any safety matter to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> operates three plants in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear and <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, in separate letters to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, said that while they found no restrictive clauses in their labor settlements, the language in four settlement agreements might be viewed as restricting the individual's ability to raise potential safety issues with the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. The utilities provided no details, but said they advised the people involved to disregard any settlement language that they thought limited their ability to raise safety issues. <ORGANIZATION> GPU </ORGANIZATION> Nuclear owns the <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nuclear station in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Oyster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> plant in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> owns the <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calhoun </LOCATION> nuclear plant in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said Monday the commission wrote letters to people involved in questionable settlements. A few of them wrote back to the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> about safety issues, but <PERSON> Newlin </PERSON> said he could not provide details. Five other companies said that while they saw no problems with any of their labor settlement deals, they wrote to people involved in 11 cases to emphasize that they were under no limits in contacting the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> about safety issues. The five are <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>$5.1 Billion Drained from Savings Accounts in August</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's thrift institutions allowed $ 5.1 billion to drain from savings accounts in August, a move an analyst says is a positive sign. `` Shrinkage is the order of the day,'' said <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, a private thrift analyst in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` It's the only effective way that marginal S & amp; Ls can meet the higher capital requirements.'' Thrift legislation, signed Aug. 9 by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, requires institutions to hold more capital for every loan or other investment they make. If an institution can not earn enough profits to add to capital or raise it from outside investors, its only alternative is to scale back operations before the new standards go into effect Dec. 7. Deposit outflows, which do n't include interest credited to savers' accounts, totaled $ 5.1 billion, compared with an inflow of $ 54 million in July. It was the highest level of withdrawals since $ 5.3 billion left thrift accounts in April, the Office of Thrift Supervision reported. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, chief economist of the thrift office, said the deposit outflow, as well as a record $ 13.4 billion reduction in assets, largely reflected a deliberate strategy by the industry. `` This was the third consecutive month in which thrifts ... shed assets to adjust to the new regulatory environment,'' <PERSON> Barth </PERSON> said. Thrift holdings of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities fell by $ 7.8 billion in August, while cash and investment securities dropped $ 3 billion. The data shows that mortgages originated by thrifts rose to $ 16.4 billion in August, up from a six-year low of $ 13.2 billion in July. However, the institutions are selling an increasing proportion of the mortgages to investors and retaining fewer in their portfolios. Savers withdrew a record $ 10.8 billion from thrifts in January and net withdrawals have exceeded $ 1 billion in every month except July. In the first eight months of the year, $ 44.5 billion drained from thrifts. August marked the 15th month of withdrawals in the 16 months beginning in May 1988. The earlier outflows were attributed to interest rates, which were rising through the spring, and to depositor uncertainty about the S & amp; L bailout. With the August report, the thrift office for the first time began reporting separate statistics for insolvent S & amp; Ls under government control and the rest of the industry. The 264 thrifts taken over by the government by the end of August, for instance, had net withdrawals of $ 1.2 billion in August, compared with an inflow of $ 187 million in July. The 2,657 other thrifts had withdrawals of $ 3.9 billion, up from $ 133 million a month earlier.

<HEAD>Adults Should Eat Less Salt, Research Council Says</HEAD>

 The average American adult can get along on as little as 500 milligrams of salt a day, far less than the usual diet contains, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says. `` Although no optimal range of salt intake has been established, there is no known advantage in consuming large amounts of sodium and clear disadvantages for those susceptible to hypertension,'' the council said in an update of its nutritional recommendations. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s 10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances, published today, also says cigarette smokers need at least 100 milligrams of vitamin C per day _ as opposed to 60 milligrams for adult non-smokers. `` Smoking seems to increase metabolic turnover of the vitamin, leading to lower concentrations in the blood,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>. The new guidelines also say pregnant women should increase vitamin C to 70 milligrams a day. The new guidelines are the first update of the nutrient recommendations in nearly 10 years. The RDAs are a major guide for developing nutrition programs and policies. `` There are a lot of little changes, up and down, but not earthshaking,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, executive director for the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION>, a health advocacy group. One of the noteworthy changes, he said, is the one on sodium. `` This marks the first time this committee or any other official committee suggested so low a number,'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said. `` They are telling Americans what is optimal, not what's convenient.'' About 75 percent of the sodium consumed by Americans comes from processed food. `` A typical serving of canned soup has almost 1,000 milligrams of sodium as flavoring,'' <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> said. `` A fast-food cheeseburger has 1,400 milligrams.'' He said previous recommendations specified 1,100 to 3,300 milligrams of sodium a day for adults. The new recommendations are not daily objectives, but rather goals to be met over time. `` In planning meals or food supplies,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, `` it is technically difficult and biologically unnecessary to design a single day's diet that contains all the RDAs for all the nutrients.'' RDAs are defined as levels of essential nutrients that are `` adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of practically all healthy persons.'' People with special nutritional needs are not covered by the RDAs. The recommended allowances are intended to be consumed as part of a normal diet. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> said they `` are neither minimal requirements nor necessarily optimal levels of intake.'' RDAs are used in a number of ways by different groups. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, for instance, uses them to evaluate the adequacy of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food supply, for setting standards for food assistance programs and determining the nutritional status of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. Most average Americans come in contact most often with the nutrition information listed on the sides of breakfast cereal boxes. They are derived from the RDAs. The new volume leaves most previous recommendations unchanged or modified only slightly, but it includes some important changes. Instead of basing <ORGANIZATION> RDAS </ORGANIZATION> for adults on arbitrary heights and weights, allowances now are based on actual heights and weights in the population. The <ORGANIZATION> RDA </ORGANIZATION> for vitamin B12, an essential nutrient for maintaining normal metabolism and function of the blood-forming organs, was reduced from 3 micrograms for men and women to 2 micrograms. The new edition lists recommended allowances for protein, 11 vitamins and 7 minerals. It points out that besides known nutrients, food contains thousands of other naturally occurring substances of nutritional value. `` A varied diet meeting RDAs,'' said the subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>, `` will probably be adequate in all other nutrients.''

 The lawyer who will represent Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee says the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat will defend himself against false allegations. `` He's chastened by the events that are true, but he's damned if he's going to run from allegations that are garbage,'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said in an interview Monday. `` Barney's been forthcoming about this publicly. He is equally certain that there has been a substantial amount of untruth peddled, or attempted to be peddled, in the public press.'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and former <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> attorney general, said he would be ready by early next week to present a detailed case that will debunk some of the sex-related charges leveled against the five-term lawmaker. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>' hiring was the latest move by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> indicating a renewed feistiness after several weeks in which friends said he was emotionally down about his prospects. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> took to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor last week for the first time since the allegations about his relations with a male prostitute became public in August. He has maintained a full schedule in his home district and has begun a legal defense fund set up by political aides. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Cahn </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s congressional office, declined to disclose how much had been contributed to the fund, saying the first public report on the account is due at year's end. A leading liberal in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has admitted paying <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> $ 80 for sex in 1985 and subsequently hiring him with personal funds to serve as a housekeeper and driver from July 1985 through August 1987. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> had acknowledged he is homosexual well before the recent publicity. <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> has leveled various charges against <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> that the congressman has denied. Among those are that <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> knew <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> was running a prostitution ring from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> apartment and that <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> engaged in sexual activity at the House gymnasium. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee investigating the Frank case plans to conclude its deliberations by the end of the year, <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said, basing his statement on two meetings with the committee's legal counsel and one with the minority counsel. `` They want very much to act promptly and want to conclude the matter this year,'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said. Members of <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s staff said they expect the case to come up at least in a preliminary form at a committee meeting later this week. A spokesman for the ethics committee said the panel's schedule for this week had not been set by Monday and that committee proceedings and the agenda are kept confidential. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> has prosecuted several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and recently gained attention for his defense of Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, who spent two years in jail after being cited for contempt of court for refusing to allow her daughter to visit the child's father.

<TEXT>
 Most farmers who planted a second crop after freezing weather and drought destroyed their winter wheat or cotton are still waiting for disaster relief checks from the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, says Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>. `` For people who are waiting for their checks, this is getting to be a problem and I'm eager to do something,'' said <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> and other <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> lawmakers contend <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s regulations implementing an $ 895 million drought relief bill unfairly cut payments to farmers who planted a second crop <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Monday that farmers who rotated their traditional spring crop to land where winter wheat was destroyed by drought or freezing weather are entitled to disaster payments. `` It does n't solve the problem most people have with their second crop,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, called the decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stabilization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> good news, but agreed it does n't go far enough in reversing <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> regulations that would cut disaster assistance to many other farmers who had also planted a second crop. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s decision Monday apparently applies only to winter wheat farmers who would traditionally plant a second crop, such as milo, on non-wheat acres in the spring. Those farmers who planted their second crop on the wheat acres instead, to take advantage of fertilizer already on the land, wo n't see their disaster checks cut, the aide said The decision does n't cover hundreds of cotton farmers who also planted a second crop, or farmers who planted non-traditional second crops on their wheat acreage or in addition to their wheat acreage, officials said. Legislators and <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> have been wrangling over the regulations on `` ghost acres'' for two months, and one <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aide said the decision came because `` we had to force their hand on this.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said farmers from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and elsewhere on the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> planted milo or cotton on their failed wheat acres this year, but were told by <ORGANIZATION> ASCS </ORGANIZATION> that their disaster checks would be reduced if they instead planted their spring cotton or milo crops on the winter wheat land. `` Had they planted the spring crop normally, without rotating it to the failed wheat acres, there would be no reduction in the disaster checks,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` It is obviously unfair to penalize farmers when they are following normal farming practices by simply rotating their crops on the farm.''

Rep. <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, R-Texas raised their concerns about the bottlenecks at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> centers with Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> during his recent state visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The Mexican government will accept only livestock that has been inspected at one of five <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state operated facilities along the border, though 23 privately run pens are available. <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said the state facilities operate only during normal business hours, while slaughter livestock are typically shipped through commercial facilities at any time of night or day. `` My people do n't want to be forced to deal with the government when private pens are available,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said Monday. `` We have sent clear signals to the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> that there is going to be congressional action'' unless they can `` come back and deal with what they perceive to be a small problem,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the five pens in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> are the only shipment facilities on the 2,000-mile border formally approved by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, although a few animals may have been shipped unofficially at other points. The agency has suggested that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> consider approving about 30 other pens in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is going to inspect the pens we have suggested and decide which ones to approve,'' he said. <PERSON> Janna </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, another agency spokeswoman, said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> may make a decision within a week to 10 days.

<HEAD>FDA Orders Chinese Mushrooms Detained at Ports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is halting the shipment of all Chinese mushrooms into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, citing a bacteria contamination that can cause severe food poisoning. The order extends a ban issued in May. `` Very little got into the marketplace,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Emil </PERSON> <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> said Monday after the agency ordered all mushrooms detained at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports. Most of the known contamination involved 68-ounce, institutional-size cans banned in May when the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> ordered the cans detained at ports after food poisoning outbreaks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The February and April food-poison outbreaks caused 100 illnesses and sent at least 16 people to hospitals. The illnesses were linked to Chinese mushrooms used by two restaurants, a hospital and on a college campus. Recalls began in March. The agency said Monday that it had identified the contamination, staphyloccocal enterotoxin, in 5.5-ounce and 16-ounce cans of mushrooms produced by 10 plants in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. All of those products have been recalled or are being recalled, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. In an Oct. 13 letter to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government, the agency warned that the restrictions would remain until manufacturing changes are made. <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> said the Chinese mushrooms do n't carry brand names when they are sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and are used mostly by food processing plants. Some importers may add their own brand names on cans sold to groceries. Chinese mushrooms account for half of the nation's imported mushrooms, <PERSON> Corwin </PERSON> said. However, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, said that since the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>'s May restrictions, Chinese imports have dropped to 8 percent of the market. Enterotoxin produced by staphyloccocus aureus bacteria can survive the high temperatures used during canning, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. Symptoms of staphyloccocal enterotoxin food poisoning, such as nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramping, can develop rapidly after eating a contaminated product. Most victims recover in two to three days. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the following code numbers appear on cans affected: _ On 68-ounce cans: TM, T3, T17, M2, B2, LT, Q15 and R12 _ On 16-ounce cans: T1 or T17 _ On 5.5-ounce cans: Q1

<HEAD>Bush Signs Interior Bill Banning Obscene Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal funds may not be used for material judged to be obscene by two government agencies, under a bill signed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The bill became the focal point of dispute in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of protests over the use of taxpayer money to display <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>'s photographs with homosexual subjects and <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>'s photo of a crucifix in a jar of urine. The measure, signed Monday, stipulates that federal funds may not be used for materials judged to be obscene by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>. The $ 11.4 billion <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spending bill for fiscal 1990 also bars oil and gas drilling in 84 million acres off the shores of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed reservations about extending for another year the moratorium on oil and gas leasing and exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf. However, he said the overall benefits of the bill outweighed his concerns. Rep. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regula </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations subcommittee on the interior, praised the action on obscene art and said he shared <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reservation on the restrictions on offshore drilling. `` We're up to about 50 percent plus imported oil now to meet our needs. I'm not for drilling every square foot. There's fragile areas off of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> we should protect. ... But there are other areas that logically should be drilled and are still included in the moratoria for aesthetic reasons.'' The moratorium means `` we ca n't look at these 84 million acres even in the event of a national -LRB- energy -RRB- emergency,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Since President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> took office, special agents have arrested more than 6,000 federal employees on charges ranging from extortion to embezzlement and tax evasion, a top law enforcement official says. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, chief prosecutor at the Attorney General's Office, said Monday that an estimated $ 82.8 million in government property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the 11-month campaign to root out official corruption. As part of the campaign, <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON>'s office will issue warrants during the next six months for the arrest of another 10,000 federal employees suspected of illegally gaining an estimated $ 376.8 million, the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the independent news service Excelsior. `` It is a difficult job, but not impossible,'' <PERSON> Castaneda </PERSON> said, and federal agents hope to recover at least half that amount. `` The rest will probably not be recoverable either because the status of limitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional time in jail rather than return the money.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> took office Dec. 1 for a six-year term.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is hailing a peace plan approved by <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but rejected by a Christian leader and the two main militias of the Shiite Moslem sect. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` congratulates the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> deputies for their courage and statesmanship, which have yielded an extraordinary opportunity to bring lasting peace in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday. `` This is the first step toward restoration of a sovereign, unified, and independent <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, free of all foreign forces,'' he said. Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> put his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces on alert after complaining that the plan did n't provide a timetable for the withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` What the deputies approved in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> is a crime I will not accept,'' he said of the accord, approved Sunday by a special parliamentary session in the Saudi Arabian city. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` warmly welcomes'' the accord. However, she said there had been no change in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy calling for the withdrawal of Syrian troops that control a vast portion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> forces that hold a security belt in the South. The pro-Syrian mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia and the pro-Iranian fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, which is believed to be holding eight American hostages, rejected the accord because they want a bigger representation in a new parliament.

 Explosions rocked a <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plastics plant Monday, hurling chunks of metal and other debris miles away and creating a fireball visible for 15 miles. At least one worker died, more than 100 were injured and 23 were unaccounted for, authorities said. Emergency crews were not likely to enter the plant before daybreak because of the fire and intense heat, said <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. The fire was still burning late Monday night. `` We're betting there's a lot of fatalities, just because of the nature of the explosion and where it happened,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON>, the director of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> emergency medical services. `` We do n't think there's anybody alive in there.'' Twenty <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> employees and at least three contract workers were unaccounted for, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. He said 109 workers were taken to hospitals, and more than 33 were admitted and up to six were in serious to critical condition. `` We know these people, we pray for their safety. It's a difficult time for all of us,'' said <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>. At least 10 others were treated for injuries, hospital figures showed. Officials had said the injured were being treated for burns, breathing problems and cuts from flying debris. The blasts buckled a ceiling and blew out cafeteria windows at an elementary school about a mile away. None of the more than 700 pupils was injured and they were all sent home, a school employee said. At the plant, leaking gas and broken water lines hampered firefighters, said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> environmental director <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltz </PERSON>, who was at the scene. Firefighters pumped water from a sewage treatment plant and the nearby <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel to fight the blaze. Several fires were visible beneath columns of dense smoke in the plant complex and patches of grass smoldered outside. The fire was brought under control about 6 p.m., five hours after it erupted, but was expected to take several more hours to extinguish, said Fire Chief <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goyer </PERSON>. It was still burning at 11 p.m. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Manerly </PERSON>, a pipefitter at the plant, said he heard hissing for about five minutes, then saw a white cloud. `` I told a safety man I saw nothing but gas. Then it exploded. I ran. There were a lot of people running and screaming to get out. It's like nothing I've felt in my life,'' <PERSON> Manerly </PERSON> said. `` I'm real lucky. Thank God for that,'' he said. Maintenance worker <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> said a warning message was broadcast over the plant's emergency radio 20 seconds before the explosion. `` I never saw people run so fast,'' said <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stoltz </PERSON> said the explosion was caused when a seal blew out on an ethylene loop reactor, releasing ethylene-isobutane, a compound used in making plastics. The plant manufactures plastics like those used in milk jugs and toys. The chemical compound is flammable and explosive but not very toxic, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, director of research for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. More than 900 people work in shifts at the plant, built in 1948 on the 800-acre complex on the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman at company headquarters in <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> closed a two-mile length of the channel for about seven hours, authorities said. No ships reported damage. `` I went to the bank which was several miles from the area and I could feel it shake,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, spokeswoman for police in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, just outside <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The first explosion at <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION>, located just off <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION> 225 less than 10 miles southeast of downtown <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, occurred about 1 p.m., Ms. Parks said. Several explosions followed, witnesses reported. Seismologists at <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said the blast appeared to be the equivalent of 10 tons of TNT. Officials closed a nearby section of Highway 225, Ms. Parks said. Thousands of people lined up along freeways to watch yellow and green flames shooting from the plant. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Baccus </PERSON> said he felt the explosion at his business at least 15 miles away and could see the flames and smoke. `` I just saw a few minutes ago a huge fireball that's plainly visible. I'm now looking at the smoke and it appears like three different fire centers, one is gigantic and two off to the side of it,'' he said. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, who lives five miles from the plant, said he came home from lunch and found find a 6-foot piece of metal in a tree. `` Pieces of stuff were falling out of the sky. I got over there to my house, and my neighbors and they were walking out in the neighborhood picking up pieces of metal and insulation off the roads,'' <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> said. He said he and his wife were at a restaurant eating lunch when `` all of a sudden the whole building shook. `` Some people started hollering ` earthquake.''' At <ORGANIZATION> Kruse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, students were herded into the gymnasium after the building was damaged. The children, pre-kindergarten to fifth grade, were sent home Monday afternoon.

The morning before he defied death at the hands of a killer earthquake, he'd been a winner at tonk, the card game of the docks played at a quarter a hand. At 5:04 p.m. on Oct. 17, the magnitude 6.9 earthquake caused a 1 \ - mile-long section of Interstate 880 to cave in around him, killing dozens of motorists and pinning Helm across the front seat of his tiny For the next 90 hours, he remained trapped under the crumbled concrete. On Monday, the 57-year-old survivor surprised his doctors at <ORGANIZATION> Highland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> by nodding his head to indicate he felt no pain. Dr. <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Huen </PERSON>, medical director of the hospital, said Helm's condition could be upgraded from very serious to serious if he continued recovering at the present rate `` When he was asked about whether he was hurting anywhere, he shook his head and everbody was incredulous,'' <PERSON> Huen </PERSON> said. After work a week ago today, Helm jumped into his silver <ORGANIZATION> Sprint </ORGANIZATION> and drove into what would become the heart of the disaster, according to a ship's clerk at the Port of <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Terminal </PERSON>. Four days later, astonished rescue workers pulled him out of the crumbled interstate. Helm's children and former wife have been at the hospital since he was rescued Saturday. `` Buck and I was married 16 years and we have some beautiful children,'' said his ex-wife, <PERSON> Lorrie </PERSON>, flanked by daughter <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON>, 12, sons <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON>, 16, and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON>'s fiancee, <PERSON> Audra </PERSON>. `` We've always been the best of friends no matter what. `` He's always been there when I needed him,'' she told reporters. `` This is when he needs us.'' <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> was afraid her father had been killed because he had n't called to say he was safe <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> is waiting for the day his father comes home and tells the kids to clean house, the way he used to, or goes back to building a rock wall in the yard. `` I'm sure when he was in there he was saying, ` There's no way,''' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> said. He is sure his father kept repeating: `` ` My daughter, she's going to get married -LRB- some day -RRB-, she's going to graduate. My son's in college. My other son's going to be going to college.' `` Just no way he was going to give up,'' <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> said. Helm, 5-foot-11 and 230 pounds, ca n't talk because a respirator tube has been run down his throat. After a news conference, <PERSON> Helm </PERSON>'s ex-wife took a 15-minute tour of the freeway where her former husband survived beyond all odds. She was escorted by police officers. `` She said, ` Oh, my God. I do n't see how anyone could make it out alive.' And then she reflected on it a minute and said, ` Well, if anyone could, Buck could,''' said police Sgt. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Huth </PERSON>. Fellow dockworkers disagreed as to whether <PERSON> Helm </PERSON> was headed to The Oaks Clubroom in neighboring <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, where he played lowball poker once a week, or to <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> where he enjoyed exotic foods. <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a ship's clerk, passed Helm on the freeway on his way home to <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> before he heard the roar and saw the clouds of dust behind him after the freeway caved in. `` If he was going to <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, he would have just gone up Market to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> said. `` I would have to assume the man was going to <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>.'' Wherever he was headed, it was in a tiny car that had more than 200,000 miles on it because of all the weekend trips he'd made to visit his family in <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION>, 250 miles north of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, co-workers said. `` You'd look at it and think that any collision would kill the occupant,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON>, chief clerk at the terminal where Helm works. Helm also kept a panel truck at the docks and slept in it many a night. On the left side of the truck, they said, Helm had painted in orange the words `` <LOCATION> Weaverville </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flash </LOCATION>,'' referring to the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> logging town. On the right side, he painted a cartoon bunny and `` Desiree's Delight,'' after the daughter he called his rabbit Inside, Helm had a mattress, a Snoopy sleeping bag, two alarm clocks, some clothes, and a panel of photographs of his children, including one of <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON> in a huge pair of football shoulderpads. `` He has tried living down in this area,'' <PERSON> Bucher </PERSON> said. `` He basically figured that rather than being in business for himself he was better off with that weekly paycheck and acted to go back to the mountains and go through the routine of commuting on weekends to and from and basically living on the docks during the week.''

<HEAD>Soviet Editor Defies Pressure to Resign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The editor of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s most popular newspaper says Communist officials want to scare the press into toeing the party line by making an example of him for straying. But <PERSON> Vladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> says he will resist pressure to quit. The editor-in-chief of the weekly Arguments and Facts appealed to Western public opinion on Monday from the office President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had suggested he vacate. `` It's a great injustice and a violation of all my journalistic rights,'' <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> said in an interview of the attack on how he has run the paper. He said he was the victim of unspecified high party officials who were trying to make an example of him `` to frighten the whole press.'' <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> said officials have forced him to cancel a planned trip to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> on Saturday, and that he was afraid he might also have to forgo a trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> scheduled for Oct. 25. Eleven days ago, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> criticized several top Soviet editors as inflaming passions and hurting reform efforst by allegedly overplaying the country's economic and ethnic troubles. He reportedly said <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> should resign over a poll his paper carried implying that human rights activist <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> is more popular than <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergeyevich </PERSON> told me that in my place he would resign,'' said <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON>. `` But I took it as a warning, not a direct firing order.'' Despite this, <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> reiterated his strong support for perestroika, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of economic and political reform. `` The most insulting thing for me in all this is that I'm being considered almost an enemy of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, or an enemy of perestroika,'' he said. `` There was never anything like that.'' <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> said, however, that officials have not been suffiently making clear the proper line the press should take. `` There is a struggle on. I understand I'm a victim of that struggle, and Arguments and Facts fell between the stones of a treadmill.'' The stocky, 49-year-old editor who has headed Arguments and Facts for 10 years said that although the weekly had made mistakes, he stands behind it. The Soviet press has carried only one vaguely worded story about the closed-door meeting at which <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rebuked the editors, and nothing at all about the call for <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> to resign. Arguments and Facts is published by <LOCATION> Znaniye </LOCATION> _ Russian for `` knowledge'' _ a national society that sponsors lectures, books and periodicals and is not under direct government control. But <PERSON> Starkov </PERSON> said the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> could order Znaniye to fire him. He would not specify who was pressing him to resign, but he said party officials were trying to get him to agree to a `` promotion'' to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or the parliament. The Arguments and Facts staff of 20 reporters and editors and was surprised their newspaper was picked out for censure, said deputy editor-in-chief <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Meshchersky </PERSON>. `` We not only criticize but try to find solutions,'' he said. `` If we have pursued an erroneous editorial policy then 26 million people are wrong.'' With a circulation of 26 million and annual profit of about $ 39 million, Arguments and Facts is the most widely read Soviet newspaper. It aims to tell people what they want to know, from rumors of a price hike on gasoline to the history of Soviet espionage.

 An upper section of the Bay Bridge that crashed onto a lower deck in last week's earthquake is too badly damaged to be used again, state transportation officials said. `` It's too bent up and unsuitable,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. But he added the decision Monday to build a new section wo n't add any time to the estimated four weeks that the main link between <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> will be closed. The damaged upper section is 74 feet long and 50 feet wide and weighs 200 tons. The section was cut in half by concrete saws and blow torches beginning Saturday to make it easier to move. Workers on Monday completed the dangerous job of removing the upper section by crane and lowering it 200 feet to a barge. The two pieces were shipped to nearby <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>. Workers also lowered part of the bottom deck that was damaged and cracked when the upper deck collapsed onto it, and planned to complete that project today. For four weeks and perhaps longer, thousands of commuters who depend on the bridge will have to find alternate routes across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The 8.5-mile-long bridge, which opened in 1936, normally carries 260,000 vehicles per day. Officials say repairs will cost up to $ 1 million. Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge, with the upper deck dangling like an open trap door, provided the first graphic illustration of the magnitude of the 6.9 <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale quake. One woman died when she drove her car into the gap. The bridge also had been in the logo created for the 1989 World Series between the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION>. But its closure contributed to Sunday's decision to delay resumption of the championship until Friday, as officials attempt to reduce traffic problems.

 A film distributor was sentenced to one year in prison for marketing videos featuring porn actress <PERSON> Traci </PERSON> <PERSON> Lords </PERSON> when she was in her teens. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottesman </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, pleaded for leniency before receiving the prison term Monday. `` My life has been probably the worst it's ever been the last three years,'' he told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON>. `` Please do n't send me to jail.''

 A judge has awarded $ 1.9 million to a man wrongly imprisoned six years for a murder he did not commit. `` How does one put a monetary value on seemingly mundane things, like sleeping in one's own bed, a stroll through the park or a hug from a loved one?'' wrote Court of Claims Judge <PERSON> Adolph </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> in a decision released Monday. <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> set the price at $ 1.935 million, which he ordered the state to pay to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, 29.

 Atlantis' five astronauts were home with most of today off, while their `` amazingly clean'' spaceship remained in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for servicing after a successful mission that sent the Galileo to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. The Galileo probe, said to be operating flawlessly, has traveled more than 1.1 million miles since deployment about 6 -LCB- hours after Wednesday's blastoff. The $ 1.5-billion, nuclear-powered probe's 2.4-billion-mile trip will take six years The long-delayed odyssey to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> will include one sweep past <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> and two by <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> to gain momentum from the planets' gravity. Once it reaches Jupiter, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will fire a probe into the Jovian atmosphere and then orbit the largest planet for 22 months. Atlantis returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Monday with a picture-perfect landing that occurred three hours early at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to avoid higher winds predicted for the afternoon. Winds moments before touchdown were only about 4 -LCB- mph. `` Atlantis, congratulations on an outstanding mission,'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> radioed from the Johnson Space Center in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` You've extended the shuttle's reach to the outer planets. `` It's nice to be home,'' replied shuttle commander <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who guided the 97-ton winged spaceship to a pinpoint landing on a hard clay runway in the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>. The 9:32 a.m. PDT landing ended a 1.7 million-mile-mission that unofficially lasted 4 days, 23 hours and 41 minutes. The mission's main purpose was launching <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, which scientists hope will find clues to the formation of the universe and provide the best look yet at another planet About 20,000 people were at Edwards to watch the landing. The crowd was small compared to past touchdowns because of the weekday landing, officials said. About 45 minutes after landing, the astronauts emerged from the shuttle and performed the traditional walkaround inspection with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials. The other crew members are pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON>, and mission specialists <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>. `` The vehicle looks amazingly clean,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenoir </PERSON>, an acting associate administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` We did not see, with a quick inspection, any significant tile damage _ a little nick here and a nick there.'' The black tiles protect the shuttle during its fiery re-entry into the atmosphere. Later in the afternoon, the astronauts left <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> aboard two <LOCATION> Gulfstream </LOCATION> jets for their home base in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. The crew members and their spouses arrived at <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ellington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> at about 6:30 p.m., where they were greeted by their children and 300 cheering friends and co-workers `` This is obviously one of the highest points in my life so far,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the crowd. `` It's super.'' The astronauts have most of today off, but were expected to the space center this afternoon to look over film they took during their mission, said spokesman <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>. They return to work Wednesday to begin a week of formal briefings about their flight. Atlantis will ride piggyback on a modified <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 for a two-day trip to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, this weekend. After deploying <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION>, the crew turned their attention to several science and medical experiments, including one that measured the Earth's protective ozone layer.

 Slogging through muddy tent encampments teeming with earthquake refugees, evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> told frightened victims not to let their faith be rattled. `` I think we have to recognize that God is a god of love and he does n't allow a thing like this to happen without a purpose,'' the preacher said while traveling by a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sedan. `` I do n't know what the purpose is. It's a mystery to me. I've never figured out all these disasters from the biblical point of view. <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> at the city's disaster center, where the preacher led a brief prayer of thanks for all the volunteers who have worked to salvage what remains of the community The mayor said she was pleased <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> came. `` We want to get people in the churches. We feel it does a great deal to get another power to help you out,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> disaster Capt. <PERSON> Jeni </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> described `` pockets of misery'' in dozens of small tent cities sprinkled throughout this agricultural community. She said there could be as many as 5,000 refugees, many of them homeless, but many just too frightened to go back to their homes despite inspections declaring them safe. An agricultural community of 27,000, <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> is known as the hub that produces much of the nation's lettuce and salad greens. It took a big hit when the 6.9-magnitude quake struck a week ago today. A total of 175 homes were destroyed, 930 homes were damaged, 17 commercial buildings were destroyed and 47 businesses sustained damage. Residential damage was placed at $ 88 million, structural damage to businesses at $ 34 million. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> shook hands with dozens of people waiting for food Monday in a pouring rain outside a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> distributiton center. Many had only cardboard boxes for umbrellas and plastic food wrap for raincoats. `` We appreciate you coming here,'' said <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Guzman </PERSON>, 34. Later, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> where he gave the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> a $ 100,000 check for earthquake relief and toured the site of the collapsed Interstate 880. `` Yes sir, there's somebody up there that's stronger than we are and stronger than anything we can build,'' the evangelist remarked as he gazed up at the concrete rubble. He called the disaster `` almost an unbelievable thing,'' and said `` it's a miracle to me there were n't more people killed than there were.'' Glancing at a nearby section of freeway deemed so dangerous it must be leveled, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said: `` It makes me think of the Tower of Babel and how it came crashing down.'' But he said he did not mean to suggest the tragedy was God's Judgment `` These are natural disasters,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, imprisoned since 1986, won permission for his release on $ 357,000 bail while he awaits a new trial on charges he handed over secrets to his Soviet lover. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> set bail on the order of the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had not been shown to be a flight risk. `` The spirit of the order of the appeals court is that they directed this court to set a bond that Mr. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> can meet,'' <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> said at a hearing Monday. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was ordered returned to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> from the federal prison in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, while papers are processed for his release. His brother, sister and a friend agreed to post property worth $ 357,757 to assure his appearance at court proceedings. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> did not require that any cash be posted. `` We're pleased that he will be getting out,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said outside court. `` It's a little later than we would have liked. But better late than never.'' <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> scheduled a hearing for Monday to determine when <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s third espionage trial will be held The first jury deadlocked in 1985. A second jury convicted him in June 1986, and <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> sentenced him to two life terms plus 50 years. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s conviction was reversed in April on grounds that jurors were allowed to hear too much about lie detector tests that <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> failed. <PERSON> Kenyon </PERSON> at first refused to allow <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s release on bail, saying he might flee. But the appeals court disagreed. The corpulent <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who battled the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> over his weight and other problems during a lackluster 20-year career with the agency, was depicted by prosecutors at his trial as a bitter, vengeful failure easily recruited as a Soviet spy. His attorneys said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was a well-meaning <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> misfit who dreamed of redeeming his career by infiltrating a Soviet spy network. Among those who testified against him was a co-defendant, <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON>, who became his lover and allegedly enticed him into spying. Mrs. <PERSON> Ogorodnikov </PERSON> and her husband, <PERSON> Nikolay </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to spying and are serving prison terms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was excommunicated by the Mormon church. His wife, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON>, divorced him following his conviction and has since remarried. She was last reported living in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Some of their eight children continue to live with their mother, <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> said, and at least two are on Mormon missions overseas. Under terms of his release, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> would be placed in the custody of <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayers </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent and private investigator who worked on the defense. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also will be forbidden to leave the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area without permission.

 Drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> urged TV industry leaders to incorporate more anti-drug messages into their programming, and called drug abuse a graver catastrophe than the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake. `` While <PERSON> Santa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> was the epicenter of that disaster ... <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> is the epicenter of a social disaster _ drugs,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sciences. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, told a group of studio executives they should help fight the war on drugs by sending anti-drug messages to their viewers. `` It seems to me we can do better than Pablum ... and better than good entertainment,'' he said Monday. `` I am not the cultural commissar. It is your business to decide what is on your shows.'' He said progress has been made in the depiction of drugs on television and in movies, with illegal substances being portrayed unfavorably. He also praised the efforts of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> to set an example of `` chic sobriety,'' but said that for every glamour capital `` there is a Watts.'' Following his speech, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> was asked by entertainer <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Vereen </PERSON> if he believed anti-drug messages delivered by former drug abusers were sending mixed messages to children. <PERSON> Vereen </PERSON> is a former drug abuser who recently has visited elementary schools to urge pupils to stay off drugs. `` I think kids need to hear what hell has been like,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` But they also need to hear from people who have never used drugs.''

<HEAD>Investigators Say Severe Downdraft May Have Caused Crash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Investigators are looking at atmospheric turbulence during the difficult approach to <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>'s airport as a possible cause of a plane crash that killed 131 people, sources close to the probe say. Some sources say an atmospheric phenomenon called a `` rolling wave,'' which can occur when wind whistles over mountains, could have created a severe downdraft or turbulence that left the plane 1,800 feet below its assigned altitude before Saturday's crash. Co-pilot <PERSON> Reiniero </PERSON> <PERSON> Canales </PERSON>, in an interview on Honduran radio, said the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 was making a normal approach on instruments through clouds when, `` Suddenly we hit something. It was all so fast we did n't have time to react.'' The crash of TAN-SAHSA Flight 414, which originated in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> with a stopover in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, killed 131 people and left 15 survivors, including pilot and co-pilot. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said 12 Americans were presumed dead; the three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> survivors have been airlifted to hospitals in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and all are expected to survive. Investigators questioned tower and air control workers and made an aerial survey of the crash site Monday. The site, heavily damaged by looters, was cleared late Monday to allow inspection by a team from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION>, the engine manufacturer. The investigators also planned to question the crew of the last previous plane to land at <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> to see if they also experienced turbulence. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON>, leader of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team, emphasized that he was in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> to assist the Hondurans in conducting the investigation. `` They are giving us every facility to help them,'' he said. Relatives of the dead continued to gather at the morgue as forensic experts tried to identify charred corpses. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> sent a plane to pick up the bodies of Nicaraguan victims. Relatives also pored over the wreckage as the search for remains continued. One man burst into tears when he found a photo of wife. The Honduran Minister of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, Col. <PERSON> Wilfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, looking gaunt and unshaven, was at the site for a second straight day searching for his daughter <PERSON> Fanny </PERSON>'s personal effects. `` I'm not here to direct. I'm just looking,'' he said, clicking a set of charred keys in his hands. When <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, whose son was killed in an air force accident last year, spotted a suspected looter he grabbed the man and ordered police to get him `` out of my sight.'' Col. <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, said pilot <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> radioed the tower at 7:52 a.m. that he was at 7,500 feet seven miles from the airport, precisely on target. The pilot was supposed to descend to 6,700 feet at the five-mile mark, 1,800 feet above the 4,900-foot Cerro de Hule. `` What happened in those last few seconds is what we have to figure out,'' said <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, who added that <PERSON> Argueta </PERSON> had not yet been interviewed because of his injuries. Sources familiar with the investigation, speaking on condition of anonymity, said other causes being looked at included possible engine failure or a false altimeter reading. <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> said it was unlikely that a piece of the plane's roof might have blown off, as happened to an <ORGANIZATION> Aloha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> jet over <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> in 1988. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the plane, which was leased from <ORGANIZATION> Contiental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, had taken off and landed 52,019 times, about average for a 21-year-old plane. A high number of takeoff-anding `` cycles'' has sometimes been seen as a factor in accidents caused by metal fatigue. Sources said repeated accounts of severe turbulence before the crash jibed with the theory of a `` rolling wave'' downdraft. They explained that the 50 mph wind flowing south over the <PERSON> Cerro </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Hule </PERSON> would follow the contour of the land until it hit another mountain behind the Cerro. The wind could then be pushed up and over itself, turning in violent eddies that cause an airplane to lose lift and drop thousands of feet in seconds. The approach to <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> is notorious among veteran Central American travelers because the airport is set at the bottom of a ring of mountains, as if it were at the bottom of a soup bowl, and the mountains are frequently obscured by racing clouds. `` It's a pretty hairy approach,'' said one source familiar with the probe.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Trial Date for Boys Accused of Raping 12-Year-Old Girl</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A 7-year-old boy, slumping in a chair and holding his mother's hand, was ordered to stand trial on a rape charge in an attack on a 12-year-old girl. The 7 year old and two 12-year-old boys, all from <LOCATION> Ypsilanti </LOCATION>, face one count each of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving accomplices, Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanowski </PERSON> said Monday after Probate Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkendall </PERSON> set Nov. 22 as the trial date. Two other defendants, boys ages 7 and 9, did n't appear at their arraignment last week and were being sought, said the <LOCATION> Washtenaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assistant prosecutor. `` This is not sexual experimentation between two young people of the opposite sex,'' <PERSON> Stanowski </PERSON> said. `` This is a gang-type offense. Two were holding her down while the third one ... knew the private areas of a woman and was fondling and molesting her. `` I was aghast that kids that age were involved,'' <PERSON> Stanowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reizner </PERSON>, a lawyer for the 7 year old, said his client was too young to face charges. `` There is a common-law presumption that children under the age of 6 are conclusively presumed not to be able to have any criminal intent,'' <PERSON> Reizner </PERSON> said. `` This child at the time of the alleged event was maybe a month and a half over -LRB- 7 years old -RRB-.'' The attack occurred July 16, authorities said. The girl was knocked down and kicked in the head, <PERSON> Stanowski </PERSON> said. During the attack, the girl's 11-year-old cousin tried to stop the boys, but they `` fended her off,'' <PERSON> Stanowski </PERSON> said. `` If these kids were adults they would be facing life,'' <PERSON> Stanowski </PERSON> said. `` Because they are juveniles ... there's a whole different avenue the court may take as far as the disposition.'' <PERSON> Stanowski </PERSON> said the boys could be put on probation and ordered to undergo counseling, placed in foster homes or assigned to in-patient mental health care if they are convicted. <PERSON> Stanowski </PERSON> said one of the 12-year-old boys also is charged with assault with a dangerous weapon in a knife attack on the same girl in August.

 RADAR STATION The power of perestroika does not in itself insure us against mistakes. It's important not to hide them, to admit them and correct them. In this respect, the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar installation issue is very significant. It took us four years to get to the bottom of it. We were charged with violation of the ABM treaty because of the station. It took the government quite a while to learn all the truth of the project. Finally, we saw it clearly: The station had been built on the wrong site, not where it should have been. All these years, we have been working hard to keep up the ABM treaty as a foundation for strategic stability. We have been looking for options and having very complicated debates on the interpretation of each article of the treaty and its supplements' contents And all the while, there stood the station, the size of an Egyptian pyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation of the ABM treaty. At last we resolved this issue and announced we would dismantle the station. This has brought some discontent in the country, as if we were forgoing our own interests. In fact, we are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the conclusion of the treaty on strategic weapons, and we're gaining the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of American installations in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> which were modernized, we understand, in violation of the treaty.

 <LOCATION> WARSAW </LOCATION> PACT COUNTRIES Here, there have been historic, qualitative changes. We are building our relations with them on the basis of sovereign equality, the impermissibility of any intervention and the recognition of each country's absolute freedom of choice. And here is where Soviet diplomacy faces the deepest restructuring in essence, methods and style. In some of them, new, alternative forces are entering the political arena. No one is leading them there. They are coming because that's what the people want. And these states do not cease to be our neighbors, our allies, our friends. All our obligations remain in force.

I am referring of course to our military engagement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It should teach us a lesson that in this case, gross violations of our own laws, intraparty and civil norms and ethics were allowed. At the time I am speaking about, M.S. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and I were candidate -LRB- non-voting -RRB- members of the Politburo. I found out about what had happened from radio and newspaper reports. A decision that had very serious consequences for our country was made behind the back of the party and the people. We were confronted with a fait accompli.

 MILITARY WITHDRAWAL For the first time in many years, not a single <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldier is participating _ nor, I'm sure, will participate _ in military actions anywhere in the world. We have now put forth the initiative of curtailing all of our military bases abroad as well as our military presence there by the year 2000. We are prepared to head toward the dissolution of the military-political blocs in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on a mutual basis.

 HUMAN RIGHTS It's shameful to admit that, not long ago, we would say, `` so-called human rights,'' and claimed we did n't have any problems with them.

 A special legislative session will be called in the next 14 days to evaluate earthquake damage and arrange for relief that could include a temporary increase in sales or gasoline taxes, the governor said. After meeting with top lawmakers for 90 minutes Monday, <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said: `` We certainly did discuss that,'' referring to the tax increases. `` The final decision on that will depend in large part on the extent of the damages together with the expected action of the federal government,'' he said. The earthquake struck the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area a week ago today, killing dozens, injuring thousands and causing up to $ 7 billion damage. The governor said he would meet with Assembly Speaker <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberti </PERSON>, both Democrats; <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddy </PERSON> and Assembly Minority Leader <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> next Monday to try to put together a special session agenda. The Appropriations Committee of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 2.85 billion aid package Monday _ $ 1 billion less than the amount sought by <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation. The governor said he and legislative leaders discussed the possibility of holding an earlier, special election to consider a ballot measure currently slated for June 1990. That proposal would liberalize the state's spending limit and pave the way for a gradual 9-cent gasoline tax increase. But he said no decision had been made on that question. The state temporarily raised the gasoline tax twice during the 1960s to repair roads damaged by storms and floods, but legislative leaders said they would prefer a sales-tax boost. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said it would take a large increase in the gasoline tax to generate the same amount of money that a 1-cent sales tax increase would provide. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said he might support the idea of a standby tax increase that would be triggered if officials determined at a later date that the funds were needed. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> also criticized the idea of moving up the election on the spending limit-gasoline tax measure, saying legislators and the governor might need all the time available to convince voters to approve the proposal. The Legislature completed its 1989 session on Sept. 16 and is not due to return to the Capitol until January.

<HEAD>Student Radicals Convicted In Deaths of Seven Riot Troopers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge today convicted 71 radical students in connection with the burning death of seven policemen and relatives of the dead troopers and of the defendants scuffled in the courtroom. About 2,000 riot policemen were deployed around the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in southern <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION> as the convictions and sentences were read to the students, all from <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Donghui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where the troopers were killed. Angry relatives of the dead policemen protested when students were not sentenced to death. Relatives of the students and of the troopers pushed and shoved and traded insults after the sentencing. Some defendants left the hearing before sentencing, saying they did n't care about the penalty. They said police commanders were responsible for the deaths because they ordered a raid on the campus. As the judge began reading the verdicts, students in the gallery sang dissident songs and shouted `` Clarify the truth.'' Of the 71 students, one was sentenced to life in prison, three received 15 years in prison and 31 others received sentences ranging from one to 13 years. The remaining 36 received suspended sentences. Both prosecution and defense lawyers said they would appeal the sentences. People convicted of murder in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> can be sentenced to death by hanging, but Judge <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Myung-kil </PERSON> said the students appeared not to have intended to kill anyone. Seven riot troopers were burned to death at <ORGANIZATION> Donghui </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> during a campus battle. The troopers were trying to rescue five police officers held hostage by radical students. Students set fire to a barricade drenched in paint thinner as the troopers climbed over it. Several officers, wrapped in flames, leaped from windows while others were burned to death or choked to death by smoke. One student was critically injured. The deaths shocked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> and the government ordered a crackdown on radical students and dissidents to halt violent protests. The radicals, who want the overthrow of the government and removal of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, have little support among the people because of their violent tactics. The prosecution had demanded the death penalty for three students they said led the violence. `` We refuse trial!'' shouted the defendants as they arrived at the courtroom. When some students defiantly refused to leave the buses, they were dragged off by prison guards.

<HEAD>Polls Show Dinkins Support Slipping in Bid for NYC Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL GEITNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New polls show support for Democrat mayoral candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has eroded, and one survey put his lead over Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> at only 4 points. Less than two weeks ago, a poll showed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Guiliani </PERSON> by 19 points. Political analysts said <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' apparent loss of support may be due to controversy last week about the handling of his finances, including discrepancies in the stated value of stock he transferred to his son. The issue rekindled questions about <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' failure to pay taxes from 1969 to 1973. In a poll of 501 registered voters conducted Sunday for the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> and released Monday, 45 percent picked <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, compared with 41 percent for <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. The survey's margin of error was plus or minus 5 percentage points. Less than two weeks earlier, a Daily News-WABC-TV poll showed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> with 53 percent to <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s 34 percent. The survey indicated that the biggest shift occurred among Jewish voters, who last week favored <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> by 10 points. Now, 44 percent of Jewish voters supported <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and 26 percent supported <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>. Twenty-six percent of Jewish voters were undecided. The election is scheduled for Nov. 7. Asked at a campaign stop to comment, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said he had `` anticipated there would be some fall-off, given the negative campaigning of recent time.'' But he said he did n't put much stock in the poll. `` I do n't know that this barometer is an accurate one,'' he said, noting that polls before the primary showed him and Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> neck-and-neck. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> won the primary easily. A poll conducted for the weekly <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> found <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' support at 47 percent, compared with 27 percent for <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and 25 percent undecided The gap between the candidates had narrowed to 20 points from 33 points since the last Observer survey. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson-Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which separately does polling for the <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> campaign, telephoned 500 registered voters Friday through Sunday for the Observer. The issue with the survey was due out Wednesday. The polls were the first since the Sept. 12 Democratic primary to show <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' support at less than 50 percent. Independent pollster <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Miringoff </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Marist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opinion </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Poughkeepsie </LOCATION>, said the decline in support in both polls showed that <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had been hurt, but it remains to be seen whether the damage will be lasting. Asked to comment on the polls, <PERSON> Guiliani </PERSON> said he believed <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' financial problems _ as well as the revelation that <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> had paid $ 9,500 to convicted kidnapper <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> for a get-out-the-vote drive before the primary _ has brought people to his campaign, which had been close to running out of money in this heavily Democratic city.

<HEAD>Survey: 54 Percent Think Mayor Should Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than half of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> residents think Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> should resign, according to a new poll that finds <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> would lose badly in races against <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and former police chief <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. The poll, conducted for <ORGANIZATION> WRC-TV </ORGANIZATION> and radio station WKYS, found 54 percent of city residents believe the scandal-plagued <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> should leave office. That figure is up from 41 percent who said in a similar poll in February that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> should resign. The random telephone survey of 508 adult residents earlier this month found 35 percent believe <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, reportedly the target of ongoing federal investigations, should remain in office and 11 percent were undecided. The poll released Monday also showed <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who is running for a fourth term next year, with weak support when matched one-on-one against two of the key figures in the city's political picture. Asked to choose between <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, 53 percent of the residents chose <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> and 28 percent supported <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, with 19 percent undecided. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> has not formally announced his candidacy but has been endorsed by the local <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s support is even weaker when placed solely against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who led 65-18 percent with the rest undecided. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is not running for mayor, but has been reported to be willing to enter the race if <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> does not run. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> leads the five announced Democratic candidates with 19 percent in the poll of residents. But the other four Democrats got between 9 percent and 14 percent and 36 of the residents were undecided when asked to pick among those candidates. The survey was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Hitlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> Oct. 5 through Oct. 19 and had a margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. It was not limited to registered voters. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has seen his political support erode since his friendship was disclosed late last year with convicted drug dealer <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>.

 Israeli-backed militiamen shot and killed two armed guerrillas during a firefight in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared `` security zone'' in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, military sources said today. The gunbattle occurred late Monday when a post of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia came under a barrage of small artillery fire near <LOCATION> Kafr </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hunah </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, the sources said. `` SLA soldiers returned fire and a terrorist was killed. No SLA forces were injured,'' said one source on condition of anonymity. The Israeli army sources said a reconaissance patrol found an AK-47 assault rifle and an explosive charge near one guerrilla's body The patrol found a second body on a later sweep, the sources said. They were unable to say if the victims were Palestinian or Lebanese. Both Palestinian and Lebanese militias have attacked <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and their militia allies in the Israeli-controlled zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. No organization has claimed responsibility for the attack on the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is trained, armed and financed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. An Israeli army spokesman, who can not be identified according to regulations, said it is believed more guerrillas took part in the clash but managed to escape. He said no Israeli troops were involved. Foreign reports have said about 500 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers patrol the 2.5-to-12-mile-wide security zone together with the militia force made up mostly of Lebanese Christians. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the buffer zone to protect its northern border against attack in June 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after a three-year occupation.

At least 6 inches of snow fell Monday on parts of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>. The storm forced closure of state Highway 120 into <LOCATION> Yosemite </LOCATION> and prompted the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol to require drivers to put chains on their vehicle wheels when traveling on mountain roads, including state Highways 80 and 50.

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the pro-choice and anti-abortion factions are predicting that some form of tougher abortion controls will be passed in the House. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is expected to begin debate on the proposed controls this afternoon. The debate follows setbacks for abortion opponents in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where legislative committees defeated restrictive proposals. National pro-choice and anti-abortion leaders have viewed <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> as a key battleground since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> decision in July that gave states more authority to regulate abortion issues. A proposal by Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s leading abortion opponent, would prohibit abortion after the 24th week of pregnancy except under threat of `` substantial and irreversible impairment of bodily function'' to the mother. Two doctors would have to approve the abortion. The legislation also would prohibit abortions based on the fetus' sex, require a 24-hour waiting period to obtain an abortion and require women to inform their husbands if they plan to get an abortion. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION>, who leads the pro-choice caucus in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said her group needs to sway about 40 members to defeat Freind's proposal. If Freind's proposal wins <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval, pro-choice lawmakers plan to try to weaken the bill with 20 to 30 amendments on issues ranging from restoration of unrestricted Medicaid funding to removal of the 24-week ban. Ms. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> and Freind both said they expected some amendments to pass, but he declined to say which ones might have a chance. Pro-choice groups plan to hold a candlelight vigil on the Capitol steps today during the debate. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is not expected to take up the abortion legislation until the week of Nov. 13. Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> supports the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> proposal.

 `` Young and Reckless'' may sound like the name of a soap opera, but a new study says it's the way some 68 million Americans approach diet and health. On the other hand, the study says 45 million others are `` healthy and wealthy'' and characterizes other large groups as `` fat and frustrated'' and even `` confused and indifferent'' about their health. The survey done for Prevention magazine found that middle-aged women with college degrees lead the healthiest lifestyles, while white, male, blue-collar workers have the worst health habits. The report, `` The Fit and the Fat,'' found a sizable group of people who want to be healthy but lack the resources, both personal and financial. Many others know what to do to be healthy but lack motivation, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dybdahl </PERSON>, director of the study. Even as the magazine was reporting on Americans' health habits, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was issuing new dietary recommendations. The average American adult can get along on as little as 500 milligrams of salt a day, far less than the usual diet contains, the council said. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s 10th edition of its Recommended Dietary Allowances also says cigarette smokers need at least 100 milligrams of vitamin C per day _ as opposed to 60 milligrams for adult non-smokers, and suggests that pregnant women should increase vitamin C to 70 milligrams a day. The new guidelines are the first update of the nutrient recommendations in nearly 10 years. The RDAs are a major guide for developing nutrition programs and policies. The Prevention magazine study, based on a survey of 1,250 randomly selected Americans, was conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. A survey of that size has a margin of error of about 3 percentage points. `` Clearly, this report demonstrates the need to deliver health information in a method that can be both heard and understood,'' added <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Bricklin </PERSON>, editor of Prevention. The survey categorized Americans into the following groups: _ The `` healthy and wealthy'' are tops in health and nutrition behavior Members of this group are careful with their diets, limit fat and make sure they get enough fiber, vitamins and minerals. They get regular medical tests, maintain proper weight, wear seatbelts and exercise. This is the group most likely to drink alcohol, but not to excess. They are about 45 million strong, more than half are women and the group is largely in middle age. Members of this group are likely to have a college degree, high income and professional or managerial job. _ The `` safe and satisfied'' tend to have a healthy lifestyle, but show little inclination to do better They limit the fat, salt and sugar in their diet but are below average in watching cholesterol. This group has the best record for exercising, and does well at maintaining the proper weight. They are below average for dental visits, sleep less than other groups and have high stress levels, however. There are 13 million people in this group, divided almost evenly between men and women. The largest share is over 50, they are slightly below average in education and income and many hold unskilled jobs. _ The `` sedentary but striving'' are overweight but want to do better They have good records for avoiding salt, fat and cholesterol but still have serious weight problems, with 77 percent of the group overweight. They know it, and about half are trying to lose weight. They exercise little, however. This group does get medical checkups, drinks little and has good records for home and auto safety. Nearly two-thirds of the 14.5 million in this group are women. They are older than the national average, are more likely to be minorities and have the lowest income levels. _ The `` young and reckless'' know what healthful practices are but make little effort to follow them They pay little heed to nutrition, especially fat consumption, are only average at getting medical care and have a poor record for using auto seat belts. They do exercise regularly, however. This is a large group, 68 million, with males being slightly more than half. They are younger than the national average and have slightly higher than average education and income levels. _ The `` fat and frustrated'' want to be healthy but do n't know what to do This group has the most members trying to lose weight, and the fewest who succeed. In nutritional habits they are about average, yet 88 percent are overweight. Their rate for exercising is less than half the national average. This group has the most non-drinkers and has regular medical exams, but members rarely see a dentist. They have high stress levels. The 13 million in this group are mostly women, slightly older than average, more likely to be minorities and have the lowest education level of any group. _ The `` confused and indifferent'' have limited knowledge of what constitutes a healthy lifestyle and do n't care They have the worst dietary habits, eating lots of fat and salt and sugar; rarely have medical checks and 74 percent are overweight. This group does have more non-drinkers than the national average. They have a poor record for seatbelt use. Men are the majority in this 9 million member group, largely whites, with lower than average education and income levels; many hold blue-collar jobs.

<HEAD>Speaker Changes Stance; `Hercules' Murals Will Stay in House for

<TEXT>
 Murals depicting Hercules that some opponents consider pornographic will remain in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, at least for now, after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker decided to support them. The Democratic speaker, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, said recent attacks on `` obscene'' art by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, helped change his mind about the black, gray and white murals called `` Twelve Labors of Hercules.'' King, who opposed the pair of murals until earlier this year, made a motion Monday in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to keep them in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber. The motion was approved on a vote of 3-2, and <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he expected the decision to stand. `` Helms really recast the way I look at this,'' he said. `` I'm not for regulating free expression by censoring art I think -LRB- art censorship -RRB- raises really ominous threats and I was no longer comfortable allowing the murals to come down.'' The murals were put up in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber in 1982, but they were shrouded in draperies until July, when <PERSON> King </PERSON> ordered them uncovered. The murals were scheduled to be removed in December because some lawmakers complained they were inappropriate and even pornographic. The creator of the murals, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Spafford </PERSON>, said he was `` shocked and extremely pleased'' by the turnaround and found <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s change of heart `` truly courageous.'' The murals, which face each other across the top of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber, portray the mythological figure's performance of 12 labors, including the removal of <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> queen <PERSON> Hyppolyta </PERSON>'s girdle. One opponent of the murals, Republican state Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Padden </PERSON>, said he will continue to fight the art when the Legislature reconvenes in January. Of the murals, he said: `` They appear to be numerous outlines in black and white of people in various stages of copulation.'' <PERSON> Spafford </PERSON> has denied any sexual content. <PERSON> Spafford </PERSON>, commissioned by the state to create the murals, said he hoped he would now be allowed to complete his original plan for a set of four.

 One-third of the nation's poor youths lack proper immunization against disease, said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>' chief in urging that children's health issues become a top national priority. To address what it considers a national crisis, the academy is drafting federal legislation that would guarantee access to quality health care for all children and pregnant women, even the uninsured, academy President Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said Monday at the organization's 58th annual meeting. <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> pediatrics professor in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, cited other statistics as well to describe what he called `` a national disgrace.'' They include: _ One of every three poor children is not immunized by age 2 against measles, rubella -LRB- German measles -RRB- or mumps _ One of every 10 children under age 4 has not seen a physician within the past year _ The nation's infant mortality rate is 22nd among western industrial nations, and lags behind countries such as <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> As many as 16 million people through age 21 are without health insurance, said Dr. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolb </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> AAP </ORGANIZATION>'s Council on Government Affairs. <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, founder of the Children's Defense Fund and a nationally known lobbyist for children's issues, agreed that the state of children's health is acute. `` We have a child emergency and crisis that's going to bring our nation to its knees,'' she said in a keynote address to several hundred pediatricians at the six-day meeting that ends Thursday.. Ms. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>'s group, a non-profit advocacy organization based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, is working with the academy to fine tune a $ 12 billion proposal aimed at guaranteeing access to quality health care for all the nation's children and pregnant women The proposed legislation would provide funds to improve employer-based health insurance for covering employees and their dependents. But more importantly, for uninsured children and pregnant women, a parallel system would be created providing private health insurance through a state-administered fund, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said. The academy, a 37,000-member group based in <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is looking for a congressional sponsor and expects the measure to be formally introduced early next year, <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> blamed the `` crisis'' in health care for children in part on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration policies that favor such things as bailing out the banking industry and lowering the capital gains tax over funding child-care issues. To remain competitive with other industrialized countries that stress health care for children, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must make a similar commitment, Ms. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said. `` It's not only inhumane,'' she said, `` it's bad fiscal policy not to invest in child care.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the disappearance of American Indian artifacts from a museum and their possible sale to collectors, museum officials and private dealers said. An inventory six months ago of <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>'s 200,000 pieces indicated more than 25 objects were missing from a storage area, said <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> Selmer </PERSON>, the museum's executive director. Selmer would not say what was missing or estimate the value of the art. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> located several items that had yet to be returned to the museum. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> official confirmed the agency was investigating because stolen goods may have been moved between states. He provided no other details. The museum near downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has a highly regarded collection of American Indian art, tools, clothing and other artifacts. Dealers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, a center of trading in Indian artworks, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents showed them photographs of blankets, pots, baskets and kachina dolls the agents said were from the museum. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimmer </PERSON>, co-owner of the Morningstar Gallery in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> today as saying he almost bought a share of a stolen pot that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> later confiscated from a friend.

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is prepared to eliminate its foreign military bases by the year 2000 and draw back to within its own borders. And he promised that as East bloc countries move away from one-party <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will observe strict principles of non-intervention and `` absolute freedom of choice.'' In a major foreign policy address to the Supreme Soviet legislature on Monday, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> also condemned his predecessors' decision to send troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, calling it a `` gross violation'' of Soviet law and ethics. He also admitted that the Soviet radar station in <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> violated the U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. The Soviets said last month that it would be dismantled, ending a dispute that soured U.S.-Soviet arms control talks for years. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s speech was extraordinary in its frankness and elevated the Supreme Soviet to a forum for major policy statements. Without specifically mentioning any East bloc country, he said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would henceforth relate to its <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies on the basis of `` sovereign equality, the impermissibility of any kind of intervention and the recognition that each country has the right to absolute freedom of choice.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, former one-party Communist states, are hurtling toward Western-style democracy and hundreds of thousands of people are taking to the streets in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to demand a similar transformation. The foreign minister said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> is prepared to liquidate all its overseas bases by the year 2000 and draw back to within its own borders. He did not specify what conditions would be set for such a withdrawal, but a year ago President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced the start of a pullback that he said would result in a 500,000-man reduction in Soviet military forces. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told the lawmakers proudly that already, `` Not a single Soviet soldier is participating _ nor, I'm sure, will participate _ in military actions anywhere in the world.'' And he said his government is `` prepared to head toward the dissolution of the military-political blocs in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' in a mutual arrangement worked out by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. He added, however, that despite recent historic changes in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> considers that `` all our obligations remain in force.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> previously has made similar offers to disband the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact, which was formed in 1955 in response to the creation of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, if the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> scraps its military alliance. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> denounced the decision by the late President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> to send <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> soldiers into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to help the Marxist government there fight the anti-communist guerrillas. He disavowed any connection with the decision to intervene and said it involved `` gross violations of our own laws, intra-party and civil norms and ethics. `` A decision that had very serious consequences for our country was made behind the back of the party and the people,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said in the speech, the full text of which was carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. At the time, both he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were non-voting members of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo. It was not the first time highly placed Soviets have disclosed that the decision to intervene in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> was made by a small circle around <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. But it had not previously been characterized by a government spokesman as an outright violation of law. The last Soviet troops pulled out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said it took <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s government four years to determine that the location of the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar station in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> violated the 1972 ABM treaty, as claimed repeatedly by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He said that as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> tried to move forward on arms treaties based on the pact `` there stood the station, the size of an Egyptian pyramid, representing, to put it bluntly, a violation of the ABM treaty.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the station will be dismantled but added: `` We are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons -LRB- long-range nuclear missiles -RRB-. And we're gaining the legal and moral right to demand clarity on the question of American installations in <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> which were modernized, as we understand, in violation of the treaty.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has claimed the treaty does not apply to its modernization of the stations in <LOCATION> Thule </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION>, and Fylingdales Moor, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, because they were in place before the ABM accord was signed. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration called <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s admission `` encouraging It builds a degree of confidence, it builds a degree of trust.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> met last month in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hole </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and issued a joint statement saying <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has decided to completely dismantle the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> station. The Kremlin had previously offered to turn the station over to a civilian agency and partially dismantle it, but stopped short of acknowledging it violated provisions of the ABM treaty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected any plan short of complete dismantling of the station, saying the ABM treaty prohibited the deployment of large radar facilities capable of giving early warnings of missile attacks anywhere except on the periphery of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> or Soviet territory. The <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> station is several hundred miles north of the Chinese border.

 A defense lawyer in the 2 -LCB- - year-old <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> child molestation trial claims medical evidence that children were sexually abused by school personnel may have been fabricated Attorney <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> made the claim Monday, the fourth day of his closing arguments, as he urged jurors to acquit <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 31, and his 62-year-old mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>. He accused prosecution medical experts of `` trying to find molestation when they could.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was expected to conclude his statement today. Prosecutors then have 3 -LCB- days to rebut defense arguments. The Buckeys face 64 counts of molestation and one count of conspiracy alleging that 11 children were molested at the now-closed McMartin Pre-School they ran in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. They were among seven people arrested in 1983, when prosecutors contended scores of youngsters had been victimized. Charges against the other five were later dropped on grounds of insufficient evidence, although all had been bound over for trial after a lengthy preliminary hearing. The trial has cost taxpayers an estimated $ 15 million, making it the nation's most expensive and lengthy criminal proceeding. Because of illness and other problems, the original panel of 12 jurors and six alternates has dwindled to 12, the minimum required by law. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> has expressed concern that loss of another juror would cause a mistrial if the case is n't concluded soon

 Young Christian followers of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> today burned tires and demonstrated in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> enclave against <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s peace plan that shifts political power to the Moslem majority. However, the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the main <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> political organization in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, declared support for the peace plan worked out by <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> legislators during three weeks of discussions in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The Lebanese forces, the main Christian militia, did not reject the plan aimed at ending 14 years of civil war, saying it had positive points. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> had ordered his 20,000 troops on alert, after he rejected the peace plan because it does not include a clear timetable for the withdrawal of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, head of the rival Moslem government, also must approve the plan. He made no immediate comment, but senior aides said on condition of anonymity that he supports the Taif accords. Smoke billowed from the burning tires as schools, banks, government offices and other businesses closed, abiding by a strike call by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian cabinet. About 10,000 youths, mainly students, demonstrated in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` We sacrifice our blood for the general!'' the demonstrators chanted as many of them waved huge posters of the 54-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> soldier. `` Yes, yes to the general. No, no to Taif!'' the demonstrators said as they headed to <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s headquarters at the bomb-ravaged presidential palace in suburban <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Addressing the demonstrators, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the accord's wording of a Syrian withdrawal `` is very vague, from now until eternity.'' Moslems have argued that the Syrian presence was their only guarantee that political reforms would occur. `` We do n't want to give away our beloved land,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said in his 15-minute address. He has said the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people should vote on the accord and offered to step down if they support the parliamentary plan. The <ORGANIZATION> Phalange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in a statement published by the daily paper As-Safir and other newspapers, called for a `` unified Christian stand to pursue implementation of the <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> plan.'' Phalangist leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadeh </PERSON>, who also heads the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> alliance of right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces, was one of the legislators who worked out the peace plan. The Lebanese forces, the main Christian militia in the civil war, said it was holding contacts with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders to formulate a `` unified Christian stand on the Taif accord.'' When <PERSON> Lebanon </PERSON> received independence in 1943, the majority Christians were given a 6-to-5 advantage over Moslems in all government posts. Moslems now make up more than 50 percent of the nation's population. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s pro-Syrian Moslem and leftist militias have expressed dissatisfaction with the peace plan, mainly for not giving them as much power in running the nation's affairs as they had requested. The <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Druse </ORGANIZATION> warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia called meetings to formulate their stands on the accord. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main ally in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said Monday he was not happy with the accord but would accept it `` upon <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s request.'' Amal, headed by <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, also rejected the plan because it did not provide greater representation in parliament for the 1.2 million Shiites, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s largest single sect. Under the plan, the 99-seat chamber will be expanded to 108, equally divided between Moslems and Christians. Amal had demanded the number be increased to 128 and hoped to get most of the additional seats. At least 930 people were killed and 2,744 wounded in six months of fierce artillery duels between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and Syrian gunners until an Arab League-sponsored cease-fire took hold Sept. 22. The latest outbreak began in March after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal militia-run ports and the Moslem-Syrian alliance responded by shelling the Christian enclave.

 The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area's 3 million commuters must cooperate until Christmas with officials urging them to use car pools or ride buses, trains or ferries to avoid gridlock, Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> says. `` So far it has been very smooth,'' said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, who boarded an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> helicopter to get an aerial view of commuter traffic Monday evening. `` There is congestion, but not anything that created gridlock.'' Despite foul weather, commuters got through without crippling problems on the first full workday since the earthquake. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Highway Patrol reported more traffic congestion but fewer accidents than normal. And early today, skies were clear and traffic on freeways and bridges moving well, transit officials said, prompting a fear that the good news may invite a return to normal driving patterns later in the week. `` We are concerned. We can only wait and see what happens. If every one went back to their normal routine, we would have the gridlock everyone is talking about,'' Sgt. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Homen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which manages the famous bridge, said today. The Bay Area Rapid Transit system set a single-day record Monday, with 261,901 passengers, 39 percent more than on the previous Monday and a record for a single day. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said some drivers were traveling alone _ something <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON> termed an `` anti-social act.'' But the mayor said many others `` have obviously made a decision to follow the advice'' to use alternative transportation while road and bridge repairs are made. `` It's just a continuation of the extraordinary cooperation and fantastic attitude'' of area residents, said <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, adding that people have refrained from looting and strangers are helping one another. `` The spirit and character of our city has never been brighter than it is is today,'' he said. `` If people will maintain this commitment, we're going to be in great shape.'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> also said several thousand commuters took advantage of the quick addition of 14 ferries. Rough water on the bay made some passengers seasick, but <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> added the gale-like weather was unusual and the ride would n't be that rough all the time. One ferry was turned back Monday because of rough waters, authorities said. The Union Ferry Building, the terminus of many ferries bound for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, was closed for an hour because of high waves and the boats were diverted to a pier about a mile away. On a 6 a.m. ferry from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, what should have been a 30-minute crossing took 55 minutes through heavy swells that occasionally washed over the deck of the boat. `` I've just been through hell, but heck, I have to admit I made it through it,'' said passenger <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Alameda </LOCATION>. `` It can only get better, this ca n't get much worse.'' `` Everybody's just going to have to go into slow motion. That includes all the bosses,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. The fleet of ferries was called into service to help make up for the collapse of a section of the 8.5-mile double-deck <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. A 50-foot section of the upper deck fell like a trap door onto the lower deck during the quake, knocking the bridge out of commission for at least four weeks. Without the 10-lane bridge, 65,000 rush-hour motorists had to find other ways to and from work. About 260,000 cars use the bridge daily. Extra subway trains and ferries can accommodate an additional 45,000 riders. Other bridges must handle the rest of the traffic that normally crosses the bridge. On the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> side of the Bay Bridge, a 1 \ mile section of Interstate 880 collapsed Other freeways also are devastated, including the Embarcadero Freeway along the waterfront in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and a five-mile stretch of Interstate 280 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was closed.

 Undercover federal agents shot and killed a suspected drug dealer near St. Patrick's Cathedral after the man drove off during a drug deal, authorities said. Monday evening's shooting occurred on a street in the middle of Rockefeller Center less than 100 feet from Fifth Avenue after two agents arranged to buy four pounds of cocaine from the suspect in a car, said <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. Once the agents saw the cocaine, they signaled other agents, who closed in, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. As the agents identified themselves, the suspect began to speed off in his <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION>, she said. One of the agents thrust his arm through a partly open window and was dragged about 100 feet, the spokeswoman said. The agent fired two shots and rolled off the car into the street, and another agent fired at least one shot, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. The suspect's car crashed into the back of a bus. More than 100 people watched as the suspect was handcuffed on the ground next to the car, then treated for a bullet wound to the chest. The suspect was unarmed, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowery </PERSON>, 23, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> was pronounced dead at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schectman </PERSON>, a hospital administrator.

<HEAD>Exxon Suit Alleges State Impeded Spill Response</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has sued the state of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> charging that cleanup of the nation's worst oil spill was hindered because the state opposed the use of oil-dispersing chemicals. A state official said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was trying to rewrite history, and that the state had approved the use of chemicals before the spill. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said it will seek reimbursement from the state for cleanup costs and damage claims that the company believes were worsened by the state's conduct. No amounts were specified. The case, filed Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Anchorage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, is a counterclaim to a lawsuit the state filed in August against <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the industry consortium that operates the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> oil terminal. The state's lawsuit alleges that negligence was involved in the March 24 wreck of the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> and the subsequent oil cleanup, and that the oil industry misrepresented its ability to deal with a major spill in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, which leads from <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> to the open sea. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s counterclaim says immediate use of chemicals to break oil into droplets was a key part of a spill contingency plan approved by the state. Nevertheless, the suit alleges, the state persistently opposed the use of chemical dispersants after the Exxon Valdez ran aground and ripped its hull open, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON>, the state Commissioner of <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that he had not examined the lawsuit, but that it appeared to be an effort to mislead the public about what he contends was a lack of oil industry preparedness for a major spill. The state did not oppose the use of dispersants in the area described by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said. He said the industry had n't stockpiled enough dispersants in south-central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> to do any good `` Exxon was n't prepared to use -LRB- dispersants -RRB- and now they're trying to rewrite the history of the spill and make it appear that someone else was the problem,'' <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said Before the spill, state and federal regulators agreed that at the discretion of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, dispersants could be used in the central part of <LOCATION> Prince </LOCATION> <LOCATION> William </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sound </LOCATION> without further state consultation, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Kelso </PERSON> said the state did not renege on that agreement. The Coast Guard authorized use of the chemicals on the evening of March 26, but by that time it was too dark to work, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said. During the night, a storm blew much of the oil out of the targeted zone, the company said.

<TEXT>
 Czechoslovakian Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> today accused Austrian media of directing anti-government demonstrations in his country and said a pro-democracy protest planned for Saturday probably will be banned. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said the Communist government in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, seen in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as one of eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s hard-liners, is open to criticism. `` But we expect honest treatment,'' he told reporters after arriving on a two-day visit. `` We notice an absence of objectivity in some of the reporting on <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' In an interview with Austrian reporters before his visit, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s government television of helping to organize banned demonstrations in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Asked by an Austrian television reporter to explain the comment, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said, `` I did n't say that exactly. But it's true that at a series of demonstrations, directives have come from various media in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>.'' Over the past year, Austrian and West German television crews have been beaten by riot police dispersing banned protests in an apparent effort to curb their coverage. Their broadcasts can be received in several parts of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Charter 77 and other independent groups have announced plans for a peaceful demonstration Saturday to mark the 71st anniversary of Czechoslovak independence. <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> said he did not know whether the demonstration would be permitted, but added, `` I doubt we would have reasons to approve it.'' Last year, 5,000 people who took part in a peaceful rally on the Oct. 28 anniversary were dispersed by riot police using batons, dogs, water cannon and tear gas. The Communist party daily Rude Pravo in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> has already warned that any protesters this year could face prosecution. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s relations with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, fraught with tension from the past centuries of Hapsburg domination of <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>, are complicated today by Austrian criticism of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s human rights record. Austrian Chancellor <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Vranitzky </PERSON> indicated after initial talks with <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> hoped to focus on improving economic and cultural ties during the current visit. The two men are also to sign an agreement designed to address Austrian concern over the safety of Czechoslovak nuclear reactors.

<TEXT>
 A real estate firm that set a city record last year by selling a mansion for $ 4.1 million is trying to beat its own mark with an asking price of $ 5.9 million for a villa along Millionaires' Row. `` Right now, the market is pretty good at the high end,'' said <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, a broker for the Boston-based firm LandVest. `` Outside of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> we just sold a place for $ 2.5 million the afternoon it went on the market. Of course, that's not typical. But it only takes one buyer to make a market at this level,'' he said. The firm is trying to sell Fairholme, a Tudor-style villa next to railroad magnate <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanderbilt </PERSON>'s former summer `` cottage,'' The Breakers. Fairholme was once owned by the sister of artist <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keeffe </PERSON>, and former President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> visited occasionally to swim in the heated pool when his back gave him trouble, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said. The mansion is now owned by <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON> <PERSON> Maschek </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` The buyer will probably be someone self-made, with new money, who wants to make a statement,'' <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Zambians glumly marked their 25th independence anniversary today with little of the jubilation that hailed the birth of what was black <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s wealthiest nation. While it was a public holiday and bunting draped some streets of <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, the capital, there were no signs of open celebrations. President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON>, who led the white-ruled British colony of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rhodesia </LOCATION> to independence as black-governed <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION> on Oct. 24, 1964, four months ago called for a low-key Silver Jubilee to save his impoverished nation money. Instead, <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> watched sporting events, tribal drummers and dancers and gymnastics at Independence Stadium here. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> canceled lavish celebrations in June as part of a package of International Monetary Fund-proposed economic reforms to salvage his country's crippled economy. <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> at the time was forced to abandon a moderate home-grown program and adopt more radical and unpopular measures including a devaluation of the Kwacha currency, lifting of state-fixed price controls and sharp increases in the cost of staple corn. All this meant severe belt-tightening for the nation's 7 million people, whose living standards have plunged since they were regarded the most prosperous black Africans at independence. Since the mid-1970s world prices of copper, which account for 90 percent of all export income, have plunged, spending on social services has been axed, unemployment and inflation are at record levels and urban crime is rampant. But on Monday night, in a nationwide television address, <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> spoke optimistically about the future of his nation. `` I see a bright future for <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We have taken very tough economic decisions. But there is no doubt in my mind that these measures will yield results sooner rather than later.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense chiefs today discussed the Western alliance's nuclear needs in an era of reduced East-West tensions. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and other ministers of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> began a two-day strategy session at the Quinta do Lago resort on <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s southern coast. A Dutch official said <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and his aides described the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear modernization effort as `` more in reaction to what the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is doing at this moment'' _ that despite an easing of tensions the Soviets were building up some long-range nuclear systems. The Dutch official, speaking on condition of anonymity, quoted the Americans as saying Soviet reform has shown up in the field of non-nuclear weapons but not on the strategic nuclear side. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s secretary-general, <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, opened the meeting by talking about the `` good perspective'' on <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> arms controls talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, according to this account. But he cautioned that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> governments should not reduce their military budgets without any concrete results. The defense chiefs did not discuss a candid speech given a day earlier by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, in which he said a disputed Soviet radar station violated the U.S.-Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and would be dismantled. He also told the Soviet legislature the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> was willing to negotiate the disbanding of the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet-led military alliances in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. There was no immediate reaction to <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s remarks. But his speech was certain to be analyzed, at least informally, by officials attending the meeting here. In advance of the talks, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officials said the ministers would not make any key decisions on their nuclear forces. `` The nuclear affairs of the alliance are running along very smoothly at this time,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official who demanded anonymity. Even so, the ministers were considered likely to give their aides the go-ahead for a detailed examination of the alliance's nuclear role at a time of enormous changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plant hit by an enormous explosion and fire is the largest of its kind in the nation and a lengthy shutdown could affect prices in the world plastics industry, analysts say. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' 800-acre <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> plant complex turns out more than 2 billion pounds of plastics per year, three-quarters of it polyethylene. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> supplies up to 19 percent of the world's raw polyethylene, and if its unit making that plastic is destroyed or shut down for a while after Monday's explosion, manufacturers could be affected. `` If the whole thing goes down, there are going to be shortages all over the place,'' analyst <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhlke </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> DeWitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a Houston-based chemical consulting firm, told the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. But, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON>, a spokesman at <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, headquarters, said today: `` It's hard to say what the effect might be on the industry. ... We're very early in the assessment -LRB- of damages -RRB-. `` There are thousands of different plastics,'' <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON> said. `` About a third of the world's plastics are made by <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> or its contractors.'' Polyethylene is made from ethylene, a gas derived from natural gas. Ethylene for the <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> plant comes by pipeline from a Phillips plant in <LOCATION> Sweeny </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> is spending $ 300 million to add 1.5 billion pounds per year of ethylene production at <LOCATION> Sweeney </LOCATION>. The polyethylene plant was to have increased production 15 percent in 1990. The high-density polyethylene comes out as milky, BB-sized pellets that manufacturers shape into anything from motor oil bottles, milk jugs, plastic bottle caps to industrial pipe and shopping bags. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> also makes 500 million pounds annually of polypropylene at the plant, using propylene gas as the base. That plastic's uses include carpet fiber and films. Some industry observers said the effect of the plant's shutdown will be tempered by a recent loosening of the plastics markets. `` Neither -LRB- polyethylene nor polypropylene -RRB- is nearly as tight as it was a year ago,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' coordinator for financial communications in <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>. Consultant <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> with <ORGANIZATION> Bonner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Moore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> said the Phillips explosion should allow a polyethylene price increase of about 3 cents per pound.

The horse racing industry groups also said parimutuel betting on <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> games was not envisioned by voters who approved the state lottery, or by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which approved legislation to set up the lottery. `` Listening to people across this commonwealth, I think they are telling me this is a bad idea,'' said <PERSON> Wilkinson </PERSON>, who previously had told lottery officials he would support the SuperSports game.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told some of the nation's best math and science teachers today that they have demonstrated not only that excellence is possible in American education but that it should `` be the norm.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, addressing the 112 winners of the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, lamented that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools do not produce more top performers in these subjects. `` You've seen all the surveys about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students' poor performance in scientific knowledge compared to their peers around the world. We've all seen it. We agonize over them,'' he said. `` You're not just complaining about it, you are doing something about it. You're showing that excellence is not just possible in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> education, but that it ought to be the norm,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lauded the victory of a high school student from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> in this year's 20th Internal Physics Olympiad in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. `` When the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began competing in the tournament in 1986 some thought that our students would n't really have a chance against students from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. But our teams have consistently distinguished themselves, capped by this gold medal performance,'' he said. `` This is the standard of excellence that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s students and teachers should aspire to, and that more can attain,'' the president said. `` Our problem is not that we do n't have American students excelling in science and math; we just do n't see enough of them.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apologized to the teachers for being `` a little bit late'' for the ceremony, held in brilliant autumn sunshine in the White House Rose Garden. Nodding in the direction of the Oval Office, he said, `` I was sitting in there trying to solve a few quadratic equations _ somewhat more difficult than balancing the budget, I might say.'' He drew more laughter with a call for `` a moment of silence in memory of those substitute teachers back home.'' The award program, begun in 1983, is administered by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The winners were named earlier this year, two from each state and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territories as well as four from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s schools abroad. The teachers were headed to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> later in the day to present their ideas for improving education to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on science, research and technology.

 Doctors performed an emergency Caesarean section on a dying woman after police located her and her wounded husband from the sound of sirens coming through the couple's open car telephone. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 33, a lawyer from Reading, died early today. Hospital officials said she was 32 weeks pregnant and delivered a live baby boy. They refused to release information this morning on his condition, which earlier was listed as critical. Her 29-year-old husband, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, was in fair condition at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with a gunshot wound in the abdomen. Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> died at 3 a.m., about seven hours after she and her husband were robbed and shot in their car by a man who accosted them outside <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital, police said. Police said they were able to locate the couple from the sound of their sirens coming through the open cellular telephone <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> had used to call for help before he blacked out. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION> were leaving <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's, where Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> had just undergone a prenatal examination, when a man climbed into their car and forced them to drive a short distance. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the assailant robbed the couple of their watches and other belongings, then shot them. At 10:40 p.m., <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> contacted state police with his cellular telephone. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> dispatcher <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> managed to get a few details from <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> on the couple's location before <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> blacked out, Trooper <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Police Deputy Superintendent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON> said police conducted a search by repeatedly turning their car sirens on and off. The dispatcher was able to tell police when they neared the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION>' car from the sound of the sirens coming through the telephone. At 10:50 p.m., police and medical personnel found the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> was able to provide a `` sketchy'' description of the attacker, <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON> said. No arrests were made. The gunman apparently thought <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> was a police officer, possibly because of the cellular phone in the car, <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON> said. Before shooting the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION>, the gunman said, `` I think you're Five-0,'' slang for police, <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakas </PERSON>, owner of the fur store <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> managed, said it was the couple's first child and they had been attending a birthing class before the shooting. The couple had just celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary, he said.

 Defense attorneys for five Americans accused of conspiring with <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> today called the Colombian drug lord a `` bad dude'' but denied he had anything to do with the defendants. Attorneys ended their final arguments and rebuttal this morning in the so-called `` Son of Lehder'' trial after <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lady </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, charged the prosecution was grasping at straws. `` <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> is a drug baron and bad dude, but I do n't know what he has to do with the people sitting over there at the -LRB- defense -RRB- table,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> said. Defense attorneys presented arguments Monday and today on behalf of their clients: The accused were not part of the conspiracy that the government alleges ran from 1974 to 1989, had withdrawn from the conspiracy, committed crimes outside the statute of limitations or were innocent. After the defense finished presenting its closing arguments today, the judge was expected to instruct the jury so it could begin deliberations. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> told the jury, `` The evidence shows only one thing _ that they are guilty as charged.'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mycock </PERSON>, who represents lawyer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, 52, of <LOCATION> Hyannis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, told the jury Monday that the government had failed to prove with any credible witnesses that <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> was guilty. If <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> had flown cocaine as alleged in 1977, he withdrew from the conspiracy, making the government unable to prosecute him because of the 5-year statute of limitations. And, <PERSON> Mycock </PERSON> said, there was not one all-encompassing conspiracy as alleged by the government, but several conspiracies. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> tied each defendant to <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> and his organization in their roles as pilots of cocaine flights and distributors of the drug. `` There was a common thread of importation and distribution,'' <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, 40, was convicted last year and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole for running a massive smuggling operation. The case grew out of an investigation that followed <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>'s trial. Defense attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallinan </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Herington </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, claimed the government `` reached down into the slime'' for witnesses. `` We do n't have one solid piece of evidence except out of the mouths of felons, liars and perjurers,'' said <PERSON> Hallinan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, called his client a hero, a family man and a law-abiding citizen, who was the victim of a government `` witch hunt.'' <LOCATION> Herington </LOCATION> faces one count of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lady </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, are accused of the conspiracy distribution count and an additional charge of conspiracy to import cocaine. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, 59, is charged with operating a continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy to distribute. If convicted, the men face possible sentences of 10 years to life.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which is distributing farm tools to thousands of recently returned refugees, is rethinking a plan to hand out machetes because of the tense political climate in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. `` The decision to distribute machetes at this time, which could be used as weapons, is under review,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckhard </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which is monitoring <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s transition to independence, repatriated more than 40,000 Namibians who fled during the territory's 23-year bush war.

 Inmates went on a rampage in one cellblock of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> and at least 29 staff members and 19 prisoners were injured. Inmates broke windows, destroyed furniture, set several small fires and threw things Monday night in Cellblock A, which houses 280 of the Huntingdon facility's 2,000 inmates, said prison spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>. The incident began when an undetermined number of prisoners refused to return to their cells after dinner, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. Then, about 25 to 35 inmates began `` throwing just about anything they could get their hands on'' as all guards left the cellblock, he said. `` We do n't think it was planned. We think it was a spur-of-the-moment type thing,'' prison spokesman <PERSON> Steryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> said today. Guards regained control of the cellblock by 9:25 p.m., <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. The rest of the prison remained secure. Four inmates and 17 correctional officers were treated for minor injuries at <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> and released, <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> said today. One officer suffering a head injury and one inmate were admitted in satisfactory condition, according to a nursing supervisor who refused to give her name. Eleven other staff members and 12 inmates were treated inside the prison, <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> said he did not believe Monday's disturbance stemmed from incidents that began Thursday, when an inmate broke a guard's jaw. The inmate was placed in restrictive housing. Four others were placed in restrictive housing Friday after as many as six inmates punched and kicked a guard, causing minor injuries, <PERSON> Grove </PERSON> said. Friday afternoon, about 75 inmates gathered in the prison control center and demanded to see two of the inmates in restrictive housing, but prison officials refused.

 Jury selection and legal wrangling resumed today for the trial of a white Hispanic policeman who killed a black motorcyclist, touching off three days of racial protests and rioting. Colombian-born <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> faces two manslaughter counts in the Jan. 16 shooting of <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, who was being chased by police, and the death of his passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, who died of injuries suffered when the motorcycle crashed. The slaying led to burning and looting in predominantly black poor neighborhoods. One person was killed and 11 were wounded, and 13 structures burned down only days before the area was host of the Super Bowl. Potential jurors passed two small groups of demonstrators on the courthouse steps Monday. Black protesters carried signs with such slogans as `` Stop Killing Black Men,'' while Hispanic demonstrators, some of them relatives of <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, waved <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s flag One man was arrested when he tried to force his way past police guarding the courthouse door. Inside, attorneys and spectators passed through two sets of metal detectors and bags and briefcases were searched. Defense attorney <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>, seeking to have the trial moved, listed for <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Farina </PERSON> the extraordinary measures adopted by police worried about a violent reaction to the trial. Police have bought 700 gas masks and made arrangements for use of two armored personnel carriers. `` I ca n't remember any trial in which it was necessary to buy armored personnnel carriers to prepare for it,'' <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said. `` We ca n't prevent a riot, but we can ensure jurors are not worried about it.'' Four times in the 1980s, police slayings of black men or the officers' subsequent acquittals have sparked racial violence in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said jurors in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> might be afraid to acquit <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> and touch off new rioting. Prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogan </PERSON> said he was not concerned about the jurors. `` The test is not whether they have heard of the case, the test is whether or not they can base a decision on the evidence in court,'' he said. `` We've been able to get juries in other high publicity cases here in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>.'' Attorneys estimated it could take weeks before trial testimony begins.

Each year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Medical science has the means to reduce the annual number of infant deaths by 10,000 in this country, a top government health official said today. `` We must remove the barriers'' to early prenatal care, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, acting surgeon general and assistant secretary for health in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION>, Youth and Families. `` There must be an outreach for those people who are unlikely to come in by themselves,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> told the committee, which is examining this country's ranking of 22nd among industrialized nations in infant mortality. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has proposed an expansion of Medicaid eligibility for expectant mothers, he said, and a White House commission on infant mortality is planning to introduce other proposals in about two months. Lawmakers are looking at such solutions for the problem as more efforts to consolidate social programs that deal with pregnant women, a streamlined application system for various social programs, and an aggressive outreach program though schools, clinics and welfare agencies to get to women earlier. Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the panel, questioned the administration's sense of urgency if it knows that 10,000 infants could be saved yearly He said there is an identifiable population of high-risk pregnant women on the rolls of the Women Infants and Children nutrition program. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said nearly 40,000 of the 4 million Americans born this year will not live past their first birthday. An additional 400,000 will live but will be born with or develop chronic problems due to inadequate care before birth. Expectant mothers who must rely on government-funded health centers rarely get the uniform care private patients receive, according to a report by the committee's minority staff released on the eve of today's hearing. It said only 18 percent of the government-funded agencies offer necessary prenatal services in the same facility. Of the 91 sites surveyed in 10 states, only 38 percent reported offering prenatal care. As a result, the care that a private patient may receive from one clinic or physician _ pregnancy testing, family planning consultation, nutrition counseling, delivery and post-partum care _ is scattered for poor women, the study said. The study is part of an effort by the committee to explore the rise during the 1980s in infant mortality and infants with low birth weight. The figures had fallen in the two previous decades. `` We are needlessly wasting hundreds of thousands of lives and millions of dollars a year because of our failure to provide adequate prenatal care to pregnant women,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the select committee <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said that in 1987, the low birth weight rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose to 6.9 percent, the highest level since 1979. Each year, 300,000 babies die or are born with low birth weight, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ranks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last among 22 developed nations in infant mortality rates, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. He said the committee wants to learn about barriers to adequate care and `` social problems that have compounded the crisis.'' Among those are AIDS, drug abuse and the transmission of syphilis to children because of increased trading of sex for drugs. A key issue is the growing number of teen-age mothers who, according to government figures, have a disproportionate share of babies with low birth weight and infant deaths. Only 53 percent of teen-agers receive care in the first three months of pregnancy, the government reported. The centers surveyed were in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

Lord <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> even arose in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION> to lash the men who run <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s cathedrals, declaring: `` Deans are dangerous.'' `` I think the whole thing could have been dealt with in an entirely different and more discreet way,'' said <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>'s dean, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>. The Anglican cathedral has found its restrooms inadequate to cope with half a million visitors a year who come to gaze at the 404-foot spire, the wealth of sculpture and an original copy of <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carta </ORGANIZATION>. The new restrooms tentatively were planned in a hidden nook at the rear of the cathedral, with a door opening off the medieval cloister. Visitors could n't see it from outside without trespassing onto the grounds of the cathedral school. However, the restrooms would be a new bump on the cathedral's ground plan, which has not changed since the foundations were laid in 1220 `` Any construction here would compromise the clarity of the cathedral plan and was therefore wrong in principle,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said in its annual report in July. `` Perhaps an aesthetically sensitive peregrine falcon flying overhead would be troubled at an alteration, but otherwise no one would see it,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said last month. His further thoughts on the dispute appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Salisbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> under the title `` Nostalgia _ Sickness of the Spirit?'' Lord <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, provoked by the bishop's support of the dean, announced in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> last week that the proposed site of the restroom was among `` the most breathtakingly beautiful spaces in the whole ecclesiastical world.'' Despite tourist herds and present controversy, <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> is recognizably the same cathedral that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Constable </PERSON> painted from the water meadows, still the serene community that inspired <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Trollope </PERSON>'s `` Barchester'' novels. `` Who could be hard upon a dean while wandering round the sweet close of <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Trollope </PERSON> wrote in `` The Warden.'' `` Who could lie basking in the cloisters of <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, and gaze on ... that unequalled spire, without feeling that bishops should sometimes be rich!'' <PERSON> Trollope </PERSON> wrote in the 19th century, when the cathedrals were agitated by demands for reform of abuses including clergymen enriching themselves by holding multiple offices. Today, stripped of their wealth, the great churches are caught up in costly concerns of preserving the national heritage. <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> is seeking $ 10.4 million to repair its spire. <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION>'s dean recently provoked a bitter controversy by proposing to sell a medieval map of the world to finance repairs costing $ 11.2 million. <ORGANIZATION> Hereford </ORGANIZATION> is off the beaten path in western <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and draws far fewer visitors than does <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, which has the additional lure of nearby Stonehenge. Controversies about alterations to the cathedral are nothing new at <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, which in the 18th century suffered the attention of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>, `` the destroyer,'' who moved tombs, knocked down a stone screen and is said to have removed most of the glass. `` There is nothing which we are proposing to do, or would want to do, to the building which could be anything conceivably on the scale or effect of anything <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> did,'' <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> said. `` The only proposals which we have tentatively proposed were things which we regarded as being so discreet that had they been done here 10 years ago, nobody would have noticed at all.''

 Newly elected East German President <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> today sternly warned against further pro-democracy demonstrations, and communist authorities for the first time admitted that police had attacked peaceful activists. Further protests were expected late today in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, a day after more than 300,000 people marched through the streets of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> demanding greater freedom. It was the largest street protest in the nation's 40-year history. Parliament elected <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> as president, and he promised to investigate charges of police brutality against pro-democracy demonstrators earlier this month. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> was in charge of police forces at the time. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, a 52-year-old career politician, last week was named the new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s supreme leadership post. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> urged an end to further demonstrations. `` Demonstrations, however peacefully they may be planned and thought out, carry within themselves the danger of ending in a different way from how they started,'' <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told the People's Chamber after his election `` Our society, which has so many new things to tackle, is thus put under increasing tension,'' he said, calling on East Germans to refrain from demonstrations to avoid a `` worsening of situation or confrontation.'' The official East German news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elected <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, who took over as party chief late Wednesday, with a large majority of the votes in the 500-member chamber. But for the first time during an election of an East German president, there were votes against the single candidate. Twenty-six members of the People's Chamber voted against <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and another 26 abstained, according to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON>. Parliament is under the tight control of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s election as president was assured after his nomination by the 21-member ruling Politburo. The People's Chamber also elected <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> to be the head of the nation's armed forces, with eight votes against and 17 abstentions, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. East German officials today admitted for the first time that police had attacked peaceful pro-democracy protesters earlier this month. `` There were instances where security officials exceeded their authority and illegal acts were committed against some of those detained,'' the government said in a statement released by ADN. The report was prepared by the national defense and justice affairs committees in parliament, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the government later decided to use restraint during mass demonstrations `` unless there is violence or the threat of violence,'' and that use of firearms to quell demonstrators had been prohibited. Police officials have apologized to victims of verifiable police brutality, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency said 83 complaints of police brutality are under initial review and four cases have been taken up by prosecuters. Monday's peaceful two-hour protest in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> and an announcement from several hundred factory workers that they formed the country's first independent labor union were considered tests of <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s professed desire to embrace reform. In <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, demonstrators carried banners and placards critical of the new leadership and the one-party system that brought <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> to power last week after the ouster of his mentor, 77-year-old <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. There were smaller demonstrations in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and in northwestern <LOCATION> Schwerin </LOCATION>. ADN reported the <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> demonstration and other public rallies on Monday but denied a free trade union had been formed in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Several hundred workers at the suburban <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieck </PERSON> electronics factory said in a statement released in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Monday that they formed an independent labor organization called `` Reform.'' The Reform group wants the right to strike, to set wages for workers and prices for products. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network reported that whole sections of the factory had already resigned from the state-run labor federation. An appeal to spread the Reform union movement was sent to other factories in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the network reported. Reform spokesman <PERSON> Roelf </PERSON> <PERSON> Boerger </PERSON> said in the statement issued in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that the existing, state-run trade union represents the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s interests and `` does n't enjoy the confidence of the workers.'' ADN quoted <PERSON> Pieck </PERSON> factory chief, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Wernicke </PERSON>, as saying, `` there was never a meeting to create a so-called independent trade union at our factory.'' The news agency also quoted <PERSON> Wernicke </PERSON> as saying that `` one factory worker'' was responsible for the Reform statement issued on Monday. `` This former trade union member did not succeed with his goal to create an independent union,'' <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Wernicke </PERSON> as saying. ADN's denial of the incident may signal the limit of the new leadership's tolerance of dissent and its fear of a force such as <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity _ which could rally <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 8.6 million workers. Supporters of Solidarity, born nine years ago during nationwide strikes, now lead <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s non-communist government. Under <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, mass demonstrations are being allowed to proceed eacefully in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the state-run media have engaged in unprecedented debate on the state of the country. But the ruling Communists have made it clear they have no intention of sharing power with the opposition. Opposition groups such as New Forum remain unrecognized by the government, and officials have declined to discuss reforms with members of the unofficial organizations. Protesters began taking to the streets in large numbers in early October as <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> celebrated 40 years as a Communist state amid an exodus of tens of thousands of skilled young people to the West. At first, police brutally beat and arrested hundreds of protesters. Officials in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> said today 530 East Germans crossed the border from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> en route to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> since Monday. Border guards said the crossings brought to 44,367 the number of East Germans who have fled since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its border for the East Germans Sept. 11.

 Several Denver-area residents who survived the crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, in July are organizing a support group to help one another cope with lingering emotional trauma. `` For me, talking to other survivors is probably the most valuable thing as far as therapy,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schemmel </PERSON>. `` You can talk to counselors, your wife, your family, but when you sit down in front of another person who went through the same thing you did, you know that person relates exactly to what you're talking about. <PERSON> Schemmel </PERSON>, 29, is one of 184 people who survived the crash of Flight 232 on July 19. The airplane cartwheeled and crashed just short of an airport landing strip en route from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, killing 112 people. The victims included <PERSON> Schemmel </PERSON>'s colleague and friend <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsdell </PERSON>, 25, commissioner of the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ramsdell </PERSON> was seated about 10 rows behind <PERSON> Schemmel </PERSON>. `` I had one week that was particularly tough for me,'' said <PERSON> Schemmel </PERSON>, who now serves as acting CBA commissioner. `` It was described by a therapist as post-traumatic depression. Then I got a call from another survivor, <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Priest </PERSON>, and the discussion just completely picked me up. `` Being able to relate to the others opens things up for me. You tell the survivors things you would n't even tell a therapist.'' <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> <PERSON> Bressieux </PERSON>, 35, another survivor, said she hopes the support group will help `` normalize what we're going through.'' `` There are very few people who have survived a plane crash, and nobody can really understand it unless they've shared that experience. I hope the support group will facilitate the healing process,'' she said.

 A doctor and his wife pleaded guilty to prostitution and were fined $ 2,500 each for paying college students to have sex with the woman. Under terms of an agreement between the prosecution and the defense, neither <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Thorp </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Steffen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> will serve time in prison, perform community service or be placed on probation. The couple sat together Monday holding hands and exchanging smiles as they waited in court. When <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattison </PERSON> asked if they had anything to say, both said, `` No, your honor.'' The <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, saying they were conducting research into the `` sexual potential of the mature female,'' paid male students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> $ 10 for each orgasm they or the 44-year-old woman experienced. Police said <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, 60, recorded the encounters and took photographs. The <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, couple were cited by police Sept. 16 at a Eugene hotel. Police said they had evidence the couple intended to carry on their `` research'' at other <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> campuses. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was suspended as director of anesthesiology at <LOCATION> Southampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, after the incident became public. The Woods were charged with prostitution after four students who were asked to have sex with `` Nancy S.'' testified before a grand jury. Among them was a 19-year-old man cited for prostitution after he received money from the couple. Prosecutor <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoar </PERSON> said the 19-year-old cooperated with authorities and never was charged. Defense attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Urrutia </PERSON> blamed his clients' plight on the media. `` All their actions were undertaken innocently and in good faith, and it is a tragedy that they now come under a cloud of suspicion and have been subject to sensational reporting in the press,'' he said. `` We can only hope that this sorry episode does not have a chilling effect on future research into areas such as human sexuality.'' <PERSON> Urrutia </PERSON> said the Woods never received any money in the encounters, and that paying a token fee to scientific research subjects is customary. <PERSON> Urrutia </PERSON> declined to discuss the origin of the research project, and said he did n't know why the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON> traveled across the country to conduct it. He said the couple pleaded guilty because they wanted to get on with their lives.

<HEAD>Fatalities Increase On Rural Interstates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Fatalities have increased an estimated 31 percent on rural Interstate highways in states that increased the speed limit to 65 miles per hour, a new government report says. But the report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said not all of the increase can be attributed to speed and higher death tolls in some states may be due to chance because the number of fatalities is so small. The agency, in a report delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, said states are in the best position to make decisions on posted speed limits and enforcement. `` The available data show that the number of rural Interstate fatalities and the rural Interstate fatality rate increased after the speed limit was raised to 65 mph,'' the report said. It estimated that fatalities on rural highways increased 31 percent from 1986, before the higher speed limit was allowed, to 1988 in those states that raised the speed limit during 1987. The agency estimated that one-third of the fatalities were due to increased traffic on the highways and two-thirds to other factors, primarily greater speed. The report is based on highway fatality data provided by the 40 states that increased the speed limit on rural Interstates, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allowed beginning in 1987. Deaths on Interstates totaled 2,836 in 1988, or about 6 percent of total fatalities. Interstate highways have a lower fatality rate per miles traveled than other roads. Overall, traffic fatalities increased in 1988 by 1.5 percent over 1987, from 46,390 to 47,079, the highway safety agency said. But the fatality rate, which considers miles traveled, remained stable at the 1987 rate of 2.4, which is the lowest in history, the report said.

<HEAD>Orders for Durable Goods Off Slightly in September</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods edged down 0.1 percent in September and would have fallen even further except for the second biggest increase in defense orders on record, the government reported Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, dropped by $ 147 million last month to a seasonally adjusted $ 126.68 billion following a 3.9 percent rise in August. Without a huge 56.3 percent surge in defense orders, the weakness in manufacturing would have been even more pronounced. Excluding defense, orders would have fallen by 3.9 percent, the biggest decline in civilian demand since May. Analysts attributed the big jump in military demand to a rush by the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to place orders in September, the last month of the government's budget year. They said the weakness in the civilian categories provided fresh evidence that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing is headed into a slowdown. `` This is a weak report showing that the industrial sector has lost momentum,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, an economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>. `` The only thing that held orders up in September was defense and that category is volatile and not indicative of underlying economic trends.'' In September, manufacturing employment took its biggest nosedive in seven years and many economists predicted that the weak orders report would lead to more layoffs in coming months. `` This report points to a sharp slowdown in industrial activity during the final quarter'' of the year, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, senior economist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. Many economists pointed to a big 5.6 percent drop in demand for non-defense capital goods in September as a particularly ominous sign, especially since it followed an even larger 10.3 percent August decline. This area, which reflects business investment plans, has been one of the key sources of strength over the past year. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, chief financial economist at <ORGANIZATION> DRI-McGraw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION>, said that he believed the country would be able to avoid an out-right recession in the coming year but that the economy had entered a period of very sluggish growth with the unemployment rate likely to rise from its current 5.3 percent to perhaps 5.7 percent by next summer. `` We are not going to have a recession, in part because the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> is easing credit conditions, but we will have a very significant slowdown in the economy,'' <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said. In September, orders in the transportation category fell by 4.7 percent to $ 34.78 billion following a 7.3 percent August increase. The September weakness was attributed to a $ 3 billion decline in orders for new cars as manufacturers cut back on production plans in the face of sluggish sales. The weakness in transportation was masked by the huge surge in defense orders, which totaled $ 12.39 billion last month. It was the second largest percentage increase on record, after a 68.3 percent jump in June 1988 pushed orders to a record monthly level of $ 13.8 billion. Orders in the machinery category that includes computers dropped 2.4 percent to $ 22.13 billion, while orders for other electrical machinery were up 6.3 percent to $ 20.64 billion. Orders for primary metals such as steel were up 1.9 percent in September to $ 11.49 billion. Shipments of durable goods fell 2.8 percent to $ 124.8 billion following a 9.6 percent rise in August. Both the September decrease and the August advance in shipments primarily reflected swings in the transportation sector. The 0.1 percent decrease in total durable goods orders was the first decline since a 2.5 percent drop in July.

<HEAD>White House Looking for Legislation to Exercise Line-Item Veto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House is looking for legislation on which President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> can seek to exercise a line-item veto as a test case, presidential press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today. Such a move _ vetoing just one part of a bill while leaving the rest intact _ would produce a major constitutional confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Some legal scholars contend that such powers are implicit in a president's power to veto legislation; others argue against such an interpretation. Now, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, the administration is willing to force the issue and prompt a court case, believing the president has such powers and should be able to exercise them. `` We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test case. We have n't found one yet,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The theory is to `` try to do it and see if it works ... You claim you have the authority and you just do it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said forcing such a test had been considered for some time, beginning in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Both former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for a constitutional amendment to ensure the president line-item veto powers, and it has long been an item on conservative agendas. However, the proposals never made it very far in either congressional chamber. Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told an audience in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Monday that the president was `` inclined to do so'' if he can find an appropriate bill in which to veto individual provisions while signing the rest into law. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said line-item veto power would allow the president to reduce federal spending. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the president will continue to press for a cut in the tax on capital gains and plans to meet with groups of mostly <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senators this week to lobby for the plan, which has already passed the House. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration has the votes to pass a cut _ if it can have a straight majority-rule vote on the measure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

 A new TV movie on <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s final days as president wo n't seem tough enough to his detractors, say journalists <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>. `` Nixon-haters wo n't be happy with the portrait because you're feeling sorry for him,'' <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> said in the Oct. 28 issue of TV Guide magazine `` You see the crushing loss, and it's just very, very clear that ... it hurt.'' The movie is based on <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s book, `` The Final Days,'' which was published shortly after the release of a film based on their first book, `` All the President's Men.''

 Hundreds of children sang `` Happy Birthday'' to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, then grabbed forks and plates and dug into a mammoth birthday cake topped with 44 candles. The party commemorated United Nations Day, marking 44 years since the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Charter came into force on Oct. 24, 1945. The organization has even been accused of suffering from middle-aged spread. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> governments have put the organization on a stringent fiscal diet, with a zero-growth budget. But the world organization can look back on the last two years as having been one of its most productive phases in years. U.N.-mediated accords led to the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, completed this year. The war front between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is still quiet since both nations agreed to a truce last year. `` There are growing signs that international relations may be entering a new and more positive era,'' said Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. `` There is, however, no reason for complacency. `` Conflicts still persist in many parts of the globe.

In 1988, the nearly half-million men and women who have worn the blue beret in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operations were honored with the Nobel Peace Prize. On Nov. 7, <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> will begin the first free elections in its history under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision, which are expected to end in the territory becoming the world's newest nation next year, after being held by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1915.

 Government agents in at least two dozen countries illegally killed tens of thousands of people in 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. Also, 1,903 prisoners were executed under death penalty laws in 35 countries last year, the highest number of such executions since 1981, the London-based organization said in its annual global survey of human rights abuses. It cited alleged violations in 133 countries, ranging from the activities of death squads in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to the harassment of church groups in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the mistreatment of imprisoned Aborigines in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and the lengthy pre-trial detention of a Puerto Rican independence campaigner. The report said more than half the world's governments tortured or mistreated prisoners and one-third of them jailed prisoners of conscience, whom <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> defines as those locked up for the non-violent exercise of their human rights. The report was written before many of the sweeping democratic reforms in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. An accompanying summary touched only briefly on the June killing of hundreds, perhaps thousands, by Chinese troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to quash the students' pro-democracy protest. It called those killings, and the killing of hundreds of civilians by <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s security forces, `` striking examples of continuing extrajudicial executions this year.'' The report said the victims of illegal killings last year were government opponents, members of ethnic or religious groups, and civilians living in areas of military operations. It said they were gunned down in groups or shot by snipers, blown up by explosives, stabbed, strangled, hacked to death or poisoned. Many were tortured to death. In <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, victims were often mutilated before being killed, the report said. It said governments made `` enormous efforts'' to conceal evidence of such killings, but details were reaching the international community more rapidly than ever before. `` Killings are carried out at night, when the victims are alone, or in remote rural areas where even large-scale troop movements can be undertaken unobserved,'' the report said. `` In urban areas, specialized squads are trained to function in secrecy and are authorized to conduct operations in areas under curfew and police control.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said many such killings occurred during armed conflict within countries, including <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` Warfare makes it easier to evade accountability; not only is access by independent observers limited but the dead can be characterized as combatants ... or as the unavoidable civilian casualties of war,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said many people became victims simply because they lived in areas whose overall population was seen as the enemy. It said Iraqi forces attacked the Kurdish population with chemical weapons, killing 5,000 men, women and children in <LOCATION> Halabja </LOCATION>. Survivors of chemical attacks were often summarily executed, and in villages near the town of <LOCATION> Duhok </LOCATION>, more than 1,000 executions in one day were reported, it said. Many killings occurred during or after anti-government demonstrations, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. It expressed concern about the Israeli-occupied territories where more than 300 Palestinian civilians were killed in 1988; <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, where at least 176 demonstrators died; and <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, where Chinese police killed dozens of pro-independence demonstrators. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it documented prisoners of conscience in 76 countries in 1988. Among the worst offenders cited were <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, where thousands were detained for political reasons, including hundreds of prisoners of conscience, and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, where conscientious objectors to military service were in prison. However, 1,566 prisoners of conscience were released worldwide during 1988, or one in every three cases taken up by <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. More than half the 300 known prisoners of conscience in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in January 1988 were released by the end of the year. Detainees were held without charge or trial in more than 75 countries, and torture and ill-treatment was reported in 94, it said. <PERSON> Filberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, a member of a Puerto Rican independence organization, was held in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> for 32 months on charges of armed robbery, it said. A federal court finally ordered his release on bail, but he was arrested again, charged with a new offense and again held without bail, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said he was held `` in virtual incommunicado detention'' with only limited access to lawyers. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes the death penalty as cruel and unusual punishment, said 1,240 people were sentenced to death in 58 countries last year. It said those figures contain only confirmed cases and believes `` the true figures are certainly higher.'' In <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, for example, 142 executions were announced, but <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it learned of at least 1,700 secret ones.

 Consumers in the future may find Macintosh computers easier to buy than red McIntosh apples, thanks to the chemical scare that led growers to stop using the growth-regulator Alar. Consumers will have to learn not to judge an apple by its color, industry experts say, because without Alar it will be difficult to achieve the ripe reds of the past. `` Appearance in the future will not be as important as condition and eating quality,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, marketing director of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> Westfield </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. This is the first year that Alar, labeled a possible carcinogen by a consumer group in February, was not widely used on the nation's apple crop. <ORGANIZATION> Uniroyal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> voluntarily removed Alar from the market last summer, and the federal government has taken steps to ban it. Alar was sprayed on apple trees because of its ability to keep fruit on the tree longer. That extended the harvest time, allowed development of a deeper red coloring in <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> and other apples and retained their crispness in long-term storage. Alar also prevented skin splitting on <PERSON> Red </PERSON> <PERSON> Stayman </PERSON> and Winesap varieties without altering taste. Now that the 1989 crop is being harvested, growers report that red apples are not as red, that the McIntosh crop is down, and that Staymans are cracking more, ruining them for supermarket sales. The immediate effect of doing without Alar is obscured in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which will produce about 60 percent of the nation's supermarket apples, because the state is harvesting a bumper crop But <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, noted that apples in the half-billion-dollar <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> crop have less internal firmness this year. The future is more troubling for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> growers, particularly in warm areas like the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basin. Alar was needed to grow high-quality apples in those warmer climates, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> extension agent for <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` In warm climates you do n't get a red apple and red seems to sell apples,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. That means growers in those areas are going to have to shift away from older varieties and plant `` something that is n't red,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. Apples from warmer climates also will not store as well, especially after nine or 10 months in storage, said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> research center in <LOCATION> Wenatchee </LOCATION>. Other apple-growing regions also face problems. In the <LOCATION> Virginia-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> region, which grows 4 percent of the nation's fresh-market apples, growers are experimenting with other varieties to supplement the mainstay Red Delicious, said <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Red Stayman apples, which split without Alar, make up 10 percent of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s $ 50 million apple crop, she said. The <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> has been a mainstay of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> region, although the McIntosh crop this year was down to 7.1 million bushels from the projected 8.3 million, largely because of weather, <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. In the future, industry officials predict, the variety will account for just 40 percent of the region's crop, instead of the current 55 percent. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is the nation's second-largest apple producer, at 10 percent, while the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> states combine for about 4 percent. The extra time on the tree that Alar produced was important in the Northeast because many <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> growers rely on visitors to pick the fruit from orchards. `` Without Alar you have now cut the four-week picking time to two weeks,'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said. `` Economically you've lost half your ability to have the public come into orchards.'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> supplies about 7 percent of the nation's apples, and growers there are n't expecting much effect from the loss of Alar because they have n't used it in recent years, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. The remainder of the nation's apple production is scattered across several other states.

 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it investigated allegations of prisoner mistreatment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and raised concerns about one inmate's lengthy pre-trial detention in 1988. In its annual global survey of human rights abuses, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> reiterated its opposition to capital punishment and said the 11 prisoners executed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year raised the total since 1977 to 104. The death row population grew to an unprecedented 2,182 prisoners in 34 states by the end of the year, it said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it investigated reports that prisoners in several state prisons had been ill-treated, including the <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> where guards allegedly beat prisoners who were handcuffed and kept in leg irons. The warden of <ORGANIZATION> Michael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> informed <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> that no such incidents had occurred, the report said. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it also looked into reports that prisoners in the Administrative Control Unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Facility </ORGANIZATION> were shackled and chained to cell fixtures. Others were alleged to have been sprayed with chemical mace and high-pressure water and left in empty, unheated cells for several days. Prison authorities denied that prisoners had been ill-treated but admitted that shackles, chains and mace were used for restraining purposes, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. The organization said it also concluded that conditions in the High Security Unit of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> Federal Prison were substandard. The unit has since been closed. A federal court also ruled it was unconstitutional for two women convicted of politically motivated offenses to be held in the unit. The court ordered their transfer into the general prison population, saying conditions in the unit at times `` skirted elemental standards of human decency.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s observer at the court hearing submitted a report saying: `` <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> concluded that the conditions of confinement constituted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It found that the prisoners' prolonged isolation, humiliating strip-searches and additional restrictions had a detrimental effect on their physical and mental health.'' <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> also raised concerns about <PERSON> Filberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON>, a Puerto Rican independence supporter held in pre-trial detention in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> for 32 months on armed robbery charges. A federal court ordered his release on bail in May 1988, saying `` due process can not tolerate any further pre-trial detention,'' but he was arrested again three months later and charged with a new offense of assault relating to his original arrest in 1985. <PERSON> Ojeda </PERSON> <PERSON> Rios </PERSON> was denied bail and again placed in detention. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it was concerned his lengthy pre-trial detention may have undermined his right to be tried within a reasonable period or else be released. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said it also asked <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> to order an inquiry into a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panther </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> serving a life sentence in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for a 1972 murder conviction. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> `` Geronimo'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> may have been denied a fair trial because of his political activities, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said. It said new evidence obtained after <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s trial indicated he was targeted for `` neutralization'' by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> between 1968 and 1971 because of his political activities. It said the evidence also revealed the chief prosecution witness was an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant and that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> planted informers in <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s defense teams A 1985 court hearing dismissed <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>'s motion for a new trial, ruling that the chief prosecution witness had been an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> contact, not an informer, and that <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> had not suffered as a result of the surveillance on his defense team. In June 1988 the <ORGANIZATION> Ninth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> also turned down his appeal on technical grounds. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> told them he was without the `` authority, ability and resources'' to order an inquiry.

 An engineer hired to investigate the earthquake-triggered collapse of an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> freeway was fired after just four days because of statements he made to a newspaper. A former state engineer, meanwhile, said the pillars supporting Interstate 880's upper deck collapsed because they did n't meet accepted safety standards at the time the freeway was built 32 years ago. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> on Monday fired structural engineer <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckle </PERSON>, who had been asked to conduct a special inquiry into the fatal collapse. The dismissal follows staunch criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> by <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> after the freeway collapsed, killing dozens of people. Transportation officials have said they were as surprised as <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> that the Oct. 17 earthquake sent the top level of Interstate 880 crashing down. The governor reiterated that he was never told the structure was a severe quake hazard. State engineers said they did n't believe the structure, or those like it, would fall in a quake. A state expert on soils stability, <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchardt </PERSON>, questioned one state engineer's conclusion that soft ground beneath the freeway was not a big factor in its failure. <PERSON> Borchardt </PERSON> said the largely clay subsurface probably `` amplified'' the quake, a condition that could have been avoided had pilings been driven to bedrock when the freeway was built. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said his staff told Buckle, who works at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, that he could not head an inquiry into the collapse because he had expressed `` a viewpoint'' in an article in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times on Thursday. Telephone calls to Buckle's home and office went unanswered Monday. In the article, Buckle wrote: `` Now is not the time to be knocking <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION>. Rather, it's time to push for more funds'' for earthquake safety. Buckle, has performed other consulting work for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. On Sunday, when <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> first publicly expressed concern about Buckle, the engineer declined to comment except to say he wrote the Times piece before he was asked to head the inquiry. The Republican governor said he would replace Buckle with someone who can be `` totally impartial and independent.'' Buckle last week inspected the wreckage and said it collapsed because it was `` an unfortunate combination of an old structure on soft ground.'' Chief state engineer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> said his department could not have warned the governor about the possibility of I-880 collapsing because his engineers felt it would not fall apart in a quake. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said he has always approved spending for earthquake safety, and seemed to fault the department for not seeking money to expedite a three-phase multimillion-dollar bridge stabilization program that began after the 1971 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> quake. While declining to comment directly on <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>'s criticism, <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> and top structural engineer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> defended their department's failure to prevent the freeway collapse. During a news conference, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said: `` Is it my fault? I was in college when this freeway was built, it was designed to the technology of the day.'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> also dismissed a section of a 1982 report to then-Gov. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> that said the freeway could collapse from bad ground, which could even turn to liquid. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who earlier suggested the soft ground played a role, said his department geologist told him the structure's pilings were driven to `` a very hard strata of compact sand, and he -LRB- the geologist -RRB- said soil liquefaction is not a problem in that area.'' But <PERSON> Borchardt </PERSON>, who wrote the 1982 section of the report for the Governor's <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Earthquake Preparedness, noted that the pilings were not driven to bedrock, an expensive endeavor given its depth of several hundred feet in the area. `` When pilings are not sitting on bedrock, you get amplification'' of the earthquake waves, he said. `` Obviously, if it had been built on bedrock, it would not have collapsed,'' he said. The former state highway engineer, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> See </PERSON>, who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Pleasant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said the columns' design should have included lateral bars running through the pillars like steel grids, holding the vertical columns steady during a major quake. See said the bracing that was missing is described as a necessary structural ingredient in columns in the 1952 engineers' manual distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Concrete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reinforcing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> trade organization <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> acknowledged that the amount of lateral reinforcement built into the columns might have been inadequate. But he insisted that the double-tiered portion of I-880 had been built in accordance with what the building code required in 1957. `` How significant they are is something for the governor's investigation team to determine.

 Thirteen thousand doctors have signed a petition asking a medical supply company to stop using surgical staplers on dogs when training its salespeople, organizers said today. The company, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surgical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, has been a subject of protests by animal rights groups. The staplers can be used in some cases in place of stitches. Eight participants _ along with <PERSON> Rusty </PERSON>, a mixed golden retriever they said was rescued on its way to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Surgical _ appeared at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> news conference before leaving for <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, where they hoped to present the petition to company officials. `` We will turn them away,'' said <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Surgical. `` They are not welcome in our facility. ... There's been too much animal rights terrorism.'' `` This organization is a sham front,'' said <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON>. `` They're a pseudo-medical group of animal rights activists.''

Physicians Committee members said most medical students learn to use instruments by observing other physicians and by practicing on cadavers or fake, foam rubber organs, making the use of dogs unnecessary.

 Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> has notified Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> that his government accepts a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plan for Palestinian negotiations, with two reservations, the Israeli embassy said today. One proviso is that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> provide assurances that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> will not participate in the talks. The other is that any <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> meeting with Palestinians before elections are conducted on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> would be restricted to arrangements for the balloting, said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON>, the embassy spokeswoman. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s spokeswoman, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, said: `` The -LRB- <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> -RRB- letter reinforces what we believe _ that they are engaged and they are working really hard to try to bridge these gaps.'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said all parties had `` tough decisions to make.'' She added: `` We are hopeful we can deal with all of their concerns and launch an Israeli-Palestinian dialogue. They key now is to get an agreement on a framework that will enable us to launch the dialogue.'' At the same time, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> declined to describe <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' letter as acceptance or rejection of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s approach to negotiations <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' letter outlining his government's position was delivered by Ambasador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> after <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> returned Monday from a speaking trip to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> `` He is not optimistic or pessimistic,'' a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said after <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> read the letter. `` He is realistic.'' <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, meanwhile, told reporters during a tour of the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> that `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will agree to the plan after the changes we proposed are accepted.'' He called the exchange with <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> positive. `` I do n't see any large gap between our views and the proposals of the secretary of state, but there are some differences,'' he said. The prime minister added that `` in a few days we will know if there is an agreement or not.'' However, members of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which supports the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposal without reservations, said they would stage a walkout in parliament to protest the government's stand. `` I do n't see anything in <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal that needs to be changed,'' said Labor leader <PERSON> Shirom </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> informed <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> in the letter that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> `` accepted basically'' his five-point proposal for a meeting with <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal included an assurance that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would be `` satisfied'' with the composition of the delegation and it assigned <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> a middle-man role of consulting with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> also requested what she called two `` tactical changes.'' One would assure <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would not participate in the meeting and the other would limit the agenda to the election itself. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and other members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition have been concerned from the outset that the meeting would turn into a negotiating session. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan provides for negotiations after the 1.4 million Palestinians on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> choose their representatives. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has rejected both the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> proposals. It was not clear whether an Israeli-Palestinian meeting could be held without at least <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> acquiesence. `` We have been saying all along that we do want to advance the peace process,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON> told a reporter. `` However, we had two concerns _ participation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the agenda _ in order not to set back the peace process.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was expected to reply to <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>, but the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign minister was on a trip to <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, which could delay temporarily further contact between the two officials. Last week, as <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s drive to set up negotiations approached a critical point, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> appealed for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help in drawing Palestinian Arabs into the election plan. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, in a letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> delivered last Wednesday, urged the administration to help overcome `` intimidation'' keeping <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> from participating in the prime minister's proposal for elections, diplomatic sources said. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to try to enlist moderate <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> governments, such as <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, to join with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in trying to implement the elections proposal, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> followed up the letter in a telephone coversation with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> last Thursday evening and with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> on Friday morning. He then went to his ranch in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> for the weekend and to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> for the arms control speech on Monday. A senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said on Friday that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was `` not going to pursue this from here to eternity.'' Also, the official said, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was giving the Palestinian problem `` 100 percent, but there could be a limit to how long you continue.'' But the diplomaic sources questioned the notion that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was reaching a dead end. `` You have a dialogue at the very highest level. It is very substantial. They are discussing substantial ideas that might lead to a breakthrough,'' said one source. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five-point proposal was put forward privately last month in an effort to implement <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan. While only the fifth point _ a meeting be held with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> before the election _ has been officially confirmed, the four others are known to include: _ Talks be held between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Palestinians. _ The meeting is designed to hold elections. _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is to be `` satisfied'' with the delegation's composition _ <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> is free to consult any Middle Eastern parties about the makeup of the delegation.

<TEXT>
 The government placed the capital and the port of <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION> under a 30-day state of emergency today, restricting civil rights and giving the military broad powers to fight leftist insurgents, an official newspaper reported. The move came less than three weeks before municipal elections scheduled for Nov. 12, which Maoist Shining Path guerrillas are trying to sabotage through a campaign of terror and assassinations. Police said rebels set fire to 10 public and private buses Monday night in different areas in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION>, five miles west of here, after forcing passengers to get off. No one was injured in the attacks, police said. The government also extended state of emergency restrictions in the <LOCATION> Andean </LOCATION> province of <LOCATION> Yauyos </LOCATION> in the department of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, the official government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peruano </ORGANIZATION> reported. The government on Monday announced new emergency restrictions in four other provinces in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> department, giving the military control over most of the country's most populous department. State of emergency decrees now cover more than one-third the area of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, including eight departments and several provinces. More than half the country's 21 million people, including 7 million in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION>, are affected. A department is the largest political subdivision in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and is divided into provinces. The government has used state of emergency decrees to combat terrorism since 1982. Among the restrictions implied in the decree are suspension of habeas corpus rights, rights of free movement and guarantees against search and seizure. The decrees remain in effect for 30 to 60 days and are routinely extended. The Maoist Shining Path began its armed insurgency in 1980 near the highland city of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. It operates throughout the Andean highlands, in some coastal areas and in the coca-producing jungles of the northeast.

<HEAD>Horses Suffer Malnutrition, Neglect on California Ranch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In one of <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s worst cases of animal neglect in years, horses on a ranch have been so underfed that they chew on wooden fence posts and eat their own manure. At least a dozen horses on the <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON> family ranch walk painfully on unclipped hooves, sleep in their own urine in unkempt stables and have swelled stomachs, a symptom of worms. Nearby ranchers have been complaining about the ranch to animal control officials for months, but said nothing was done until recently. They said it must have taken about a year for the horses' conditions to deteriorate `` This whole thing makes me sick,'' said <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, a horse breeder and one of several residents pressing <LOCATION> Riverside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> animal control officers for action. `` Here we are sending aid to foreign countries and this is happening in the heart of our country.'' For as long as anyone can remember, the ranch has been operated almost single-handedly by <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON>, who said he is 79 years old but is believed by friends to be in his mid-80s. The ranch, about 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, is owned by <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON>, a certified horse show judge who animal control officials said is now working with the county to set up a feeding and veterinary schedule for the horses. Pressure on the county peaked Oct. 11, when one of the ranch's horses _ a former champion show mare _ had to be destroyed after it apparently was improperly fed When a reporter visited the <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON> ranch last week, about 20 of the ranch's 30 horses were so skinny their ribs, hip bones and spines protruded. Wooden fence posts and the top of a gate had been chewed away by the horses. Many of the animals were eating their own feces. Some horses had matted hair and skin sores from lying in their urine. Some walked awkwardly on hooves that had n't been trimmed in months. `` I've been working with horses for years, and I've never seen anything this bad,'' said horse breeder <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON>. The matter may be referred to the district attorney for legal action. The elder <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON> denied that he has mistreated the animals and said they are properly fed daily. `` Some of the horses are OK and some are not,'' he said. `` Some are real old and are going to have to be destroyed. That mare -LRB- that was destroyed -RRB- was 30 years old and just could n't go on any more.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Allmond </PERSON>, who lives in nearby <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jacinto </LOCATION>, did not return a reporter's telephone message Tuesday. <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, the county's chief animal control officer, said action against the Allmonds wo n't be taken until a veterinarian called in finishes a report on his inspection of the ranch earlier this month. The ranch has emerged as one of southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s worst cases of animal neglect since humane officers in 1975 discovered 100 horses starving on breeder <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellsworth </PERSON>'s ranch in <LOCATION> Chino </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Justice Department Issues Tightened RICO Guidelines</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has tightened its rules for bringing racketeering cases and for seizing defendants' assets before trial, according to memos released Tuesday. A policy requiring approval by senior <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials of efforts to seize a defendant's assets was imposed in response to criticism of the tactic in several highly publicized cases, according to one of the memos, which were sent to federal prosecutors. The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act allows prosecutors to obtain temporary restraining orders to seize assets of defendants to ensure the funds are available if a jury orders them forfeited as part of a verdict. But Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> S.G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said prosecutors should make clear in court that `` the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant.'' `` Some highly publicized cases ... have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> wrote in the June 30 memorandum. Another memo, by Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, head of the tax division, sharply limits the use of the RICO law in tax-fraud cases. Mail-fraud charges may be sustituted for tax-fraud charges to form the basis of RICO prosecutions `` only in exceptional circumstances'' when a tax return is mailed to promote a `` tax-fraud scheme,'' she wrote in a separate memorandum. `` Charging a tax offense as a mail-fraud charge could be viewed as circumventing congressional intent unless unique circumtances justifying the use of a mail-fraud charge are present,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, who heads the department's criminal division, did not mention any specific pre-trial asset seizures that prompted criticism. But defense attorneys roundly criticized former <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> for obtaining a court order seizing the assets of a securities firm whose officers were charged with racketeering. Defense lawyers contend that the government's forfeiture demands drove the firm, <ORGANIZATION> Princeton-Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> LP </ORGANIZATION>, out of business last December. Jurors who convicted five Princeton-Newport partners and a sixth defendant of racketeering charges in August awarded only $ 3.8 million of the $ 21 million prosecutors sought in forfeitures, with $ 3 million coming from one defendant. Originally targeted at organized crime and drug traffickers, the RICO law was used for the first time in the Princeton-Newport case to prosecute securities dealers.

But <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> wrote that his memo `` implements new policy'' requiring approval by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section before prosecutors seek temporary restraining orders to seize a defendant's assets. To get such approval, `` the prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies -LRB- such as bonds -RRB- are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> wrote in the memo, first disclosed over the weekend in <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, newspaper. He noted that `` the government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissable under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime.'' Forfeiture orders, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> noted, `` can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants, including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependents and others.'' The new requirements were instituted `` to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> dimissed suggestions that <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>' memo was issued in response to tactics employed by <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who is now the <ORGANIZATION> Republican-Liberal </ORGANIZATION> candidate for mayor in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` To the best of my knowledge, the answer to that is no,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> noted that the government's asset-forfeiture actions in the Princeton-Newport case were upheld in the courts.

 Forget monthly payments and sky-high list prices. About 40 bargain hunters camped out on a <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> dealer's lot for a chance to buy cars for as little as $ 1.99. `` Obviously at $ 1.99 you do n't make money.

This is my winter ride.'' <PERSON> Dugan </PERSON> said the prices `` return something to the community to give people a chance to own a car.''

<HEAD>Bar: Lawyers Look To Help, Not Exploit Quake</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It's become a cliche that every disaster is followed by a lawyer looking to turn tragedy into a quick buck. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> says that does n't seem to be the case with the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake. So far, say officials of state and local legal organizations, the response of lawyers to the Oct. 17 quake has been to offer free or low-cost help to victims. Still, some lawyers stand to make substantial sums down the road if they can provide liability for damage, injury or death. `` We have not received by phone any complaints of unethical solicitation -LRB- of clients -RRB-, maybe in part due to the fact that we got out there early and acted as a deterrent,'' <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, director of investigations for the 117,000-member <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday. `` On a national basis, historically there as been solicitation in disasters. The legal profession is trying to put a stop to that.'' He said the bar distributed 6,000 leaflets to legal groups and shelters for earthquake victims, spelling out rules on solicitation: A lawyer can advertise services but ca n't go to an accident scene or hospital to recruit clients, for example. A toll-free number is listed for complaints. The <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose members often represent victims in injury lawsuits, has promised to guard against ambulance-chasing. The office of famed injury lawyer <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belli </PERSON>, which says it will sue the state over the collapse of a freeway overpass in the quake, says its attorneys are being careful not to solicit clients. Meanwhile, lawyers are being mobilized to help those injured or displaced by the earthquake. Volunteer lawyers will be stationed at clinics run by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, helping people apply for benefits, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinch </PERSON> of the bar's Board of Governors. `` Within three hours of the earthquake, the State Bar was organizing those clinics,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Clinch </PERSON>, who organized legal clinics after a September 1988 fire that destroyed more than 200 homes in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It's a wonderful opportunity for lawyers to become involved.'' `` We called people Saturday morning for a 2 o'clock clinic, many still digging out of their own rubble, and people just dropped everything and came down here,'' said <PERSON> Drucilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramey </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION>. Plans for clinics include presentations by federal disaster officials, insurance representatives, landlord-tenant experts and others. Then participants could speak with volunteer lawyers. More information is to be provided through toll-free telephone numbers, already set up by several counties and the State Bar. Ms. <PERSON> Ramey </PERSON> said common concerns of tenants of damaged buildings include rent obligations, getting security deposits back and rights when buildings are demolished. Inquiries are also numerous about whether homeowner's insurance covers earthquakes _ the advice is to file a claim in every case _ and about federal aid and the rights of employees, said lawyers. Most county bar associations have ongoing lawyer referral programs. Although free service is normally provided only after a financial screening, `` I imagine substantially all of it will be pro bono -LRB- free -RRB- in the next few weeks,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schadlich </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alameda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. At some point, however, some lawyers will be talking about lawsuits involving large sums of money. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of <PERSON> Belli </PERSON>'s office said it has been contacted by relatives of people who may have died in the collapse of Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and are interested in suing the state. But <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Belli </PERSON> has not contacted any victims or relatives _ `` he'd lose his license if he'd done that'' _ and instead has two lawyers working full-time to offer free legal consultations on earthquake-related matters. Fees would be charged only if a lawsuit were filed.

<TEXT>
 Professor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> can live with ordinary euphemisms but his teeth gnash when a worker is told he has been `` dehired'' because the firm is experiencing `` negative employee retention.'' The employee has been fired in a layoff. But no one is willing to say so, laments <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, who has written `` Doublespeak,'' a book denouncing the use of words to conceal meaning. In <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>'s book, patients do n't experience pain, just `` discomfort.'' Too much of that and `` terminal living'' may occur; that's death. So is `` negative patient care outcome.'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> is willing to accept terms that gloss over unpleasant truths _ `` passed away'' and `` rest room,'' for example _ but balks when airlines announce that the plane is in no condition to fly: `` Ladies and gentlemen, because of a technical difficulty there will be a change of equipment. Will you please deplane at this time?'' He does n't like it, either, even when all goes smoothly and `` the equipment has arrived and is now being serviced prior to our beginning the preboarding process.'' But it is going just too far, says <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, when the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> refers to bombs that accidentally kill civilians as `` incontinent ordnance'' or when lawyers write off a plane crash as `` the involuntary conversion of a 727.'' That, he says, is language `` designed to distort reality and corrupt thought.'' He thinks the practice is disgraceful, dangerous to democracy, perverse and pervasive. Hard work, too. Doublespeak is n't just the natural work product of the bureaucratic mind, he says; it is invented painstakingly, by committees laboring to cloak what the words are n't permitted to say. `` Doublespeak is not a slip of the tongue, or language used out of ignorance, but is instead a very conscious use of language as a weapon or tool by those in power to achieve their ends at our expense,'' he writes. <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>, 48, teaches English at the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> campus of <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and heads the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doublespeak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> of English. `` I have a real sense of outrage that something as beautiful and powerful as language is being perverted,'' he said in an interview. `` I think that language is the most precious invention of human beings.'' Doublespeak is used by bureaucrats, like those who wrote a government safety pamphlet that says: `` Exit access is that part of a means of egress that leads to an entrance or an exit.'' But it is also used by businessmen, advertisers, and educators who call classrooms `` pupil stations'' and students from poor homes the `` economically non-affluent.'' In the work world, people who are fired in doublespeak are `` dehired'' or `` non-retained'' or `` non-renewed'' or `` selected out'' by firms that are having `` workforce adjustments'' or `` headcount reductions.'' When <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> closed an operation in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, it `` initiated a career alternative enhancement program.'' Some 5,000 employees were enhanced out of work. Simple words can also conceal truth. An advertisement that says a remedy `` helps relieve cold symptoms fast'' says little, says <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON>. `` Help'' does n't mean it will succeed; `` relieve'' means it will ease, not cure; `` cold symptoms'' are the runny nose, not the cold itself; `` fast'' is a matter of judgment. The ad's promise boils down to not much. In the business world, a black-and-white television is `` television with nonmulticolor capability'' and a used car is `` experienced.'' A gas station attendant becomes a `` petroleum transfer engineer. The disease has crossed borders and is as old as the hills. <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> described his brutal subjugation of another state as `` pacifying'' <PERSON> Gaul </PERSON>. Pacification reappeared as an American goal in the Vietnam War. To <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the newly ousted leader of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> was an `` anti-fascist protective rampart.'' And when the emperor of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> called it quits in World War II, he told his people, `` The war situation has developed not necessarily to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s advantage.''

 Folks in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> may have been out of luck if they tried to buy fresh <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> strawberries last Wednesday and Thursday. Electrical failures after last Tuesday's earthquake meant 125,000 crates of berries, many bound for East and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> markets from this farming community, were left unrefrigerated overnight. By the time they reached their destinations, they were spoiled. A week after the quake forced more than 1,000 residents into tents and shelters, employers still are assessing their losses. `` I would not be one to say losses will be minimal. Under the circumstances, they might be considered minimal, but to the individual they are pretty severe,'' said <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Agricultural Commissioner <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>. An estimated $ 5 million to $ 6 milion worth of crops were bruised or damaged when the quake toppled storage bins, according to <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> of the Agricultural Extension Service. And losses at the plants that process 40 percent of the country's frozen foods wo n't be known until workers determine how much of the produce shaken from 30-foot-high shelves can be repacked and how much must be thrown out. Most companies say those losses should be small, indicating that while production lines and shipments of frozen broccoli, cauliflower and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> sprouts have been slowed, the industry is n't devastated. `` I do n't think there's a doubt the industry will rebound,'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said. `` It's the heart and soul of the area.'' More than $ 7 million worth of packaged vegetables spilled onto the warehouse floor at the <ORGANIZATION> Richard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> frozen food company. But President <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said he expects most of the vegetables can be repacked. `` We're hoping $ 500,000 -LRB- in losses -RRB- is a worst case,'' <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. `` We're hoping we can get it down to a 5 percent loss of what's on the floor. Our focus is going to be on shipping merchandise, ship now and clean up later. We've got to ship to create space to speed up the clean-up.'' <PERSON> Strawberry </PERSON> packers are expecting very little loss. `` The season ends Nov. 1, so we're fortunate it happened at this time. There's not really much to recover from since we're near the end anyway,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Naturipe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> But stalled production will be felt strongly by the 7,000 residents who harvest crops from local fields or work in the food processing plants here. The personal losses they have suffered have been compounded by the lack of a place to work. <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> expects to be closed for at least two weeks, leaving 600 people out of work, and <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is operating with about 200 of its 900 employees. `` Not only have they lost their jobs, but there are no alternatives left in town,'' <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said. Even the agriculture industry, which makes up 65 percent of the community's economy, may not be strong enough to rebuild the town by itself. `` We have quite a large population in the city who work in agriculture, and all the downtown store owners depend on people to spend their paychecks at the store,'' <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said. `` A lot of people's homes are destroyed,'' he added. `` Those people may work in agriculture, but that's not going to help.''

 Rescuers found one body today and planned an extensive search for 22 missing workers in the smoldering rubble of a plastics plant where fiery explosions killed at least two people and injured 124. The body was found by six firefighters and safety experts who ventured into the devastated <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> complex, where explosions Monday afternoon flung debris five miles and shook the ground 25 miles away. The emergency response team decided it was safe to send a larger search party in later today, Sheriff <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON> said. He said they would need heavy equipment to move the body and search for others in the rubble. `` It's going to take a long time. This is not going to be easy. Some of the buildings are gone _ not there,'' <PERSON> Klevenhagen </PERSON> said. Authorities varied on whether there could be survivors. `` You always hope for the best. Our fingers are crossed,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. `` We do n't think there's anybody alive in there,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON>, director of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s emergency medical services. Doctors treated 124 people for injuries. Thirty-five were hospitalized, up to six of them in critical condition, <PERSON> Pepe </PERSON> said. Some had severe burns, he said. Survivors said they had less than half a minute's warning to get out of the plant after a reactor began leaking flammable gas that ignited in a huge fireball. `` I thought it was the end,'' said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON>, a 35-year-old worker. `` I was thinking, ` Run till you die.''' A thin column of smoke was rising from the plant this morning as several members of an emergency response team went inside. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> officials said the fire was contained and the smoke and gas released were not toxic, but that the team would have to judge whether it was safe to send in a larger group of rescuers. `` The fire is just about out. That was the objective overnight,'' said <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Phillips </LOCATION> spokesman at the scene. `` With daylight now we can start to account for the unaccounted.'' Twenty <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> employees and at least three contract workers were unaccounted for, <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> told reporters late Monday. The body of a worker was found at the plant, but <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> did not have other details. `` We know these people, we pray for their safety,'' <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's a difficult time for all of us.'' Seismologists at <ORGANIZATION> Rice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> said the blast appeared to be the equivalent of 10 tons of dynamite. The first explosion could be felt as far away as 25 miles. Several explosions followed. `` It was like somebody just dropped an atomic bomb,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Manerly </PERSON>, a pipefitter at the plant, which makes 4.5 million pounds a day of plastics like those used in milk jugs and toys. The blasts buckled a ceiling and blew out cafeteria windows at an elementary school about a mile away. No one was injured, but the school's 700 pupils were sent home. The first explosion at <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Complex </ORGANIZATION>, on the <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> Ship Channel just off Highway 225, occurred early Monday afternoon. Maintenance worker <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> said employees had 20 seconds to escape after a warning message was broadcast over the plant's emergency radio Workers said they heard a hissing sound and saw a white cloud. The explosion that followed knocked them off their feet. Many then saw a fireball. `` It looked like somebody set a boulder on fire and was rolling it towards us,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowson </PERSON>, 37, a construction worker. `` Everybody was a-duckin', a-dodgin' and a-runnin','' said D.E. <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, 49, an iron-worker foreman who was able to account for his 150-man crew. `` We outran the fire.'' `` I never saw people run so fast,'' added <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON>. Firefighters fought the blaze by pumping water from a sewage treatment plant and the nearby ship channel. The fire was brought under control within five hours but continued to burn. A two-mile section of the heavily-traveled channel was closed for seven hours, authorities said. No ships reported damage. Officials did n't immediately know what caused the explosion. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> environmental director <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltz </PERSON> said a seal blew out on an ethylene loop reactor, releasing ethylene-isobutane, a compound used in making plastics. The reactor is built of tubes where the key chemical reactions take place. The ethylene is fed to the plant through a pipeline from <LOCATION> Sweeny </LOCATION>, about 75 miles southwest of the plant in this town if 100,000 people. The pipeline was shut down after the blast, but up to 90,000 gallons of ethylene and plastics were believed to have burned, said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. More than 900 people work in shifts at the plant, built in 1948 on the 800-acre complex, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dryden </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman at company headquarters in <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. The blast sent pieces of metal flying through the air. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, who lives five miles from the plant, said he came home from lunch to find a 6-foot piece of metal in a tree. `` Pieces of stuff were falling out of the sky,'' <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, which has lived in the shadow of its huge Soviet neighbor since World War II, is hoping President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will finally recognize Finnish neutrality during a visit this week. Such a declaration could once and for all bury the notion of `` Finlandization'' and open a new chapter in relations, analysts said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, arrives Wednesday for a three-day visit crammed into a busy year of traveling that has included trips to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will meet with President <PERSON> Mauno </PERSON> <PERSON> Koivisto </PERSON> and the two countries will sign agreements on bilateral trade, joint ventures and transboundary pollution control. The two leaders also may sign a joint declaration which, for the first time, describes this country as `` neutral <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>.'' Earlier communiques have said only that <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> `` aspires toward a peaceful policy of neutrality.'' <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> was an autonomous Grand Duchy of <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> for 100 years before the 1917 Russian revolution, when <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> granted <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> its independence in gratitude for hiding him from Czarist forces. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is scheduled to pay tribute to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s assistance to the founder of the Soviet state with a visit Wednesday to a room where <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> stayed while in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. He also is scheduled to meet with Finnish business leaders, visit <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and travel to the northern city of <LOCATION> Oulu </LOCATION>, dubbed `` The City of Technology.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> badly needs Western technology and goods to revive the stagnant Soviet economy that suffers from chronic shortages of consumer goods and food, and Finnish companies have a long tradition of doing business with the Soviets. <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s No. 2 trading partner among capitalist countries, and it imports 80 percent of its oil from its Communist neighbor. The fall in international oil prices has thrown off the two countries' trade balance but several trade agreements will be signed during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit, including on joint ventures and Finnish involvement in the industrial development of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s strategically important <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. The two countries have become friends and major trading partners despite a bloody history. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> fought two wars from 1939-44, and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> was forced to cede large parts of its eastern territory. In 1948, the two countries signed the Treaty of Friendship, <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> adopted a neutral stance which depended heavily on good relations with its eastern superpower. Traditionally, the Soviets have been reluctant `` to openly and publicly'' recognize <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s neutrality, said <PERSON> Raimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vayrynen </PERSON>, an international politics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION>. `` There have always been qualifications,'' he said in an interview. <PERSON> Vayrynen </PERSON> said he welcomes reports that the declaration to be signed during <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit will contain `` unequivocal recognition of our neutrality.'' Despite <PERSON> Vayrynen </PERSON>'s hopes, the Soviets are not hinting yet of any change in their position. <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grachev </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s international department, said the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has no reason to re-define <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s neutrality `` Several decades of cooperation between <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have strengthened mutual trust and the value of <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>'s neutrality in our bilateral relations,'' <PERSON> Grachev </PERSON> said After World War II, Soviet interference in Finnish domestic politics was common, and the term `` Finlandization'' was coined to describe this country's allegiance to the Soviets. But relations have become more open and natural. `` Certainly there has been a big change,'' <PERSON> Vayrynen </PERSON> said. Referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of openness, he continued, `` Glasnost has alleviated some of the anxieties that existed about the potential consequences of Finns taking a stand on issues that might offend the Soviets.'' <PERSON> Grachev </PERSON> said the earlier denigrating use of `` Finlandization'' was `` short-sighted'' and that other countries could use Soviet-Finnish relations as a model. `` The Finlandization of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> may be regarded nowadays as the spreading and development of the whole European process which has proved in the past years to be of mutual benefit practically to all states in both parts of this continent,'' <PERSON> Grachev </PERSON> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> climbed back on top of the <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> ratings and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> slipped to the bottom in an unusual week in which the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> earthquake rocked television schedules. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> seemed certain to repeat its victory of the week before, when it ended <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s 68-week winning schedule. But the earthquake last Tuesday forced postponement of the World Series just as the third game was getting underway in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Candlestick Park. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers'' was first for the week ended Oct. 22, closely followed by `` The Cosby Show.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s highest-ranked show was its Monday Night Football game between the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rams </ORGANIZATION> and the Buffalo Bills. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> was first in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> survey with an average of 14.1. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second with 12.6 and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> third with 12.1. The ratings represent the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million household tuned into a program. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s coverage of the games, and counterprogramming by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, fell by the wayside. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, unprepared with alternative programming, dropped to third place. None of its entertainment programs made the Top 10 because its strong Tuesday comedy lineup was pre-empted, first by the planned World Series and then by special coverage of the earthquake. The Tuesday night pre-game show tied for 44th place. The networks' special coverage of the earthquake was not ranked by <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> because it was unscheduled and not sponsored. The network evening news shows, however, had nearly five million extra viewers who tuned in because of the quake. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was first, followed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Giants </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> are not due to resume World Series play until Friday. The resumption depends on the weather and repairs to the ballpark. Here are the Top 10: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dear John'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes'' tied, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Empty Nest,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Unsolved Mysteries'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Do You Know the Muffin Man? tied, and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Monday Night <ORGANIZATION> NFL </ORGANIZATION> Football. The networks all had follow-up coverage of the earthquake with special reports and in regularly scheduled news magazine show. Here's how they did: <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' in a tie for 20th place, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 48 Hours'' 29th, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> special report 34th, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` PrimeTime Live'' in a tie for 37th place, and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s special report 43rd <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Married ... With Children'' was its highest-rated show. It tied for 46th place. Its next highest show was `` Open House'' in a tie for 69th place. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` World News Tonight'' led the news shows with a rating of 11.5. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was second with 11.2 and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> third with 10.7. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> was rated for only four nights because the night of the earthquake it pre-empted its <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> news feed for special coverage.

Here are the five bottom shows: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie `` Stuck With Each Other,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Mr. <PERSON> Belvedere </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Mystery Movie `` B.L. <PERSON> Stryker </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Living Dolls'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Saturday Night with <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>.''

 Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading today as the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buyout helped unnerve an already shaky market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials spiked downward as much as 85 points in the morning before partially rebounding. It was down 48.36 points to 2,614.55 by 2 p.m. EDT. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout failure, analysts said traders were worried about lower-than-expected corporate profits in the third quarter and signs of economic weakness in the government's latest report on factory orders Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by 11 to 2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 246 higher, 1,348 lower and 313 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 164.94 million shares as of 2 p.m. on Wall Street. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> plunged 32 | to 145 -RCB- by 2 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors said late Monday it has decided to keep the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> independent for now as it examines alternatives to a $ 300-a-share employee-management buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month The announcement that the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> group was unable to get financing for the deal helped trigger a 190.58-point drop in the Dow industrials on Oct. 13. The market bounced back last week, gaining a record 119.88 points total, but the Dow average slipped back by 26.23 on Monday. Analysts said the news that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would remain independent affected other transportation stocks and generally triggered the morning selloff. Computerized program trading also contributed to the decline. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the plunge in stock prices sent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 stock-index futures down the 12-point limit permitted under `` circuit-breaker'' rules designed to slow heavy market selloffs. Index futures prices rebounded after trading resumed. The government's report today of a slight decline in durable goods orders during September today did nothing to dispel concerns over lower-than-expected corporate profits for the third quarter.

<HEAD>Hungarians Have a Democracy, With the Same Old Worries</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hungarians proclaimed a democracy and honored the long-maligned 1956 revolt, but on Tuesday they had the same leaders and the same problems: how to tell truth from lies and live on $ 100 a month or less. A day after the heady celebration, a pensioner said he hoped for `` a price freeze, so we can live better.'' With annual inflation above 20 percent and the government lifting food subsidies under market reforms, his wife said, they can afford meat only on Sundays. An estimated 100,000 Hungarians cheered the new democratic republic Monday when acting President <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueroes </PERSON> proclaimed it from the Parliament balcony. That evening, even more filled the same square to honor the anti-Stalinist revolt of 1956, which was crushed by Soviet troops. They applauded proclamations by former revolutionaries that real democracy will be achieved only when Hungarians can elect leaders of their choice. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has changed its name, one-party rule remains in force, at least until planned multiparty elections planned for next year. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has committed itself on the path to democracy. <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> adopted legislation last week creating the legal framework for the first free elections in more than 40 years and, before that, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> disbanded in favor of a new <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committed to democracy. Economic survival was a common topic on the street Tuesday. Many Hungarians place their hopes in Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, a 41-year-old economist who is introducing market forces and private ownership. `` For the past 40 years, we have heard nothing but lies,'' the retired couple said in unison. They and others interviewed would not give their names. The husband said lies continued, but at least `` the leadership has finally expressed the truth about what happened here 33 years ago.'' He and his wife live on a small pension and constantly face poverty, which official statistics say threatens 25 percent of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s 10.6 million people. Even for working people, the average wage barely exceeds the equivalent of $ 100 a month. As the retired couple spoke, a woman nearby counted bottles she had collected to redeem for the deposits. Westerners notice an increasing number of pensioners stopping them on the street to ask for change. An 18-year-old cook said <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had experienced `` tremendous changes'' in the past year, but `` I will be optimistic when I do n't see any Communists anywhere. He expressed faith in <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>'s ability to run the government A store clerk said, `` I trust <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> because he's relatively young and a technocrat.'' The premier, who studied at <ORGANIZATION> Karl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, is committed to a market-oriented economy as part of any reform program. A pensioner from a village nea <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Balaton </LOCATION> said economic reform would allow `` ordinary Hungarians to have a better future once a market economy is created.'' He said he had to supplement a monthly pension of 5,000 forints -LRB- less than $ 100 -RRB- with part-time work at the post office and selling produce from his garden. A young book vendor said the changes this month indicated `` something has begun to move, and we just have to hope concrete changes will come.''

<HEAD>Segregationist Commission Supplied Speeches For Mississippi Officials</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s segregationist watchdog agency supplied state lawmakers, officials and educators a standard speech promoting segregation to deliver before Northern audiences in 1963. The speech claimed separate drinking fountains and bathrooms were necessary because many blacks lacked morals, education and proper hygiene, according to a copy obtained by The Clarion-Ledger. `` There are many Negroes, of course, who have reached plateaus of citizenship,'' the speech says. `` They are personally clean, have high morals and are educated. However, they are still in the minority.'' The now-defunct, state-sponsored <ORGANIZATION> Sovereignty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spied on, infiltrated and harassed civil rights groups during the 1960s. It also funded the White Citizens' Council, an organization established to promote segregation. <PERSON> Erle </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of Forest, who plans to describe the commission and the events of the 1960s in a book, said he wrote the speech and its accompanying answers to questions expected from the Northern news media. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who usually accompanied the speakers, handled public relations for the commission in the 1960s before serving as its director from 1963 through 1967. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> defended the speech as appropriate for its time. `` We were trying to let people know how things worked in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. We did n't try to convert a soul. We just tried to tell them how things worked,'' he said. Segregation in the 1960s was in its death throes and its defenders `` resorted to any means of survival,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sansing </PERSON>, a professor of history at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION>. `` A society that discriminates and exploits will not mind lying. It would just do whatever it had to do to justify a system that had no defense,'' <PERSON> Sansing </PERSON> said. The commission paid air fare, meals and other expenses for the volunteer speakers, who included a reporter from The Clarion-Ledger, well-known in the 1960s for its hard line against integration. Titled `` The Message From <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' the speech claims <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> blacks preferred segregationist ways. `` Many of our colored leaders, ministers, educators and newspaper editors openly endorse the separate school system and repudiate the outsiders who come into <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to violate our laws,'' the speech says. The questions and answers discuss two of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s most infamous civil rights slayings, referring to both as `` unsolved murders:'' _ Seven days after 14-year-old <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> native <PERSON> Emmett </PERSON> <PERSON> Till </PERSON> whistled at a white store owner's wife, his body was pulled from the <LOCATION> Tallahatchie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tallahatchie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on Aug. 31, 1955 He had been beaten and shot once in the head. An all-white jury acquitted two white men of the killing. While Till's slaying `` was a crime of violence we deplore,'' the speech says, what <PERSON> Till </PERSON> did was `` a very serious offense, although it was not deserving of capital punishment.'' _ On April 24, 1959, in <LOCATION> Poplarville </LOCATION>, a mob of at least 23 white men dragged <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, a black 23-year-old truck driver accused of raping a white woman, from his jail cell, shot him, weighted him with chains and threw his body in the <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> The speech claims the killing took place because `` Mississippians had watched as court decrees stayed the execution of a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Negro </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsby </PERSON>, who shot down a white woman as she was trying to protect her husband.'' The speech also claims that the federal government was responsible for the riot that resulted in two deaths following the 1962 admission of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> into the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> as its first black student. `` There was no disturbance, no injury, no death, so long as the state of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> was permitted to be responsible for law and order in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' the speech says. `` It was only when the federal authorities acted hastily in firing tear gas into a group of students and others that violence, injury, death and destruction of property resulted.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Gangs Blamed For Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAITHAM HAMAD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NABLUS, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 PLO-allied gangs with fanciful names like `` Black Panther Brigades'' and `` Red Eagles'' are blamed for most of the 20 murders here of Arabs accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Israeli officials claim some gangs operate under direct order of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But Palestinians maintain that at least some of the murders have been carried out in defiance of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. With 132 Palestinians killed for alleged collaboration in the 22-month-old Palestinian uprising, there are fears that the executions are getting out of hand. Palestinians complain that ordinary citizens are being intimidated by the frequent murders. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> killed a 24-year-old upholstery worker and wheeled his body through the streets of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s largest city in a pushcart, presumably as a warning to others. In the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, a school guard was found burned to death in his car Oct. 5 and graffiti signed by the `` Palestinian Revolutionary Eagles'' took responsibility the slaying. A senior Israeli defense official on Tuesday confirmed a report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that security forces had discovered documents linking the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction Fatah One letter quoted by the Times says slayings should be blamed on the little-known Eagles group in order to deflect blame from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The Times said, however, that the documents could be forgeries. If genuine, the papers could give credence to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s repeated arguments that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is sponsoring murder despite his claim to have renounced terrorism in December. Israeli officials have frequently cited the slayings of Palestinians by fellow <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> as reason for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to halt its dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, begun after <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s statement on terrorism. The pace of the killings has quickened as the uprising has dragged on without political gains. Of the 132 slayings by Palestinians since the revolt erupted in December 1987, 110 occurred this year alone. At least 601 Palestinians have been killed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers or civilians during the revolt, and 40 Israelis also have died. Palestinian sources say the murders of some supposed collaborators claimed by such groups as the Abu Jihad Phalangists are ordered by opponents of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s policies. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> are believed backed by the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Syrian-based <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction that opposes <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s efforts to negotiate an agreement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, residents of the <PERSON> Yasmina </PERSON> quarter where the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> operate say the gang is murdering people despite appeals from PLO-backed uprising leaders and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> himself. They say the gang's members, believed to be 10 men ages 19 to 25, wander freely through the dark, twisting alleys of <PERSON> Yasmina </PERSON>, often armed with knives, hatchets or pistols. `` People are scared to death,'' a 32-year-old <PERSON> Yasmina </PERSON> shopkeeper said. `` They are afraid to leave their houses.'' The shopkeeper, like others who agreed to discuss the Black Panther slayings, would not allow his name to be used out of fear. <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> residents and local journalists said the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> have carried out 15 or 16 of the 20 slayings in the city, most of alleged collaborators but also including prostitutes and drug dealers who some activists consider enemies of the uprising. The Black Panthers are allied with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction, but local <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> officials say the gang's members are running out of control, ignoring orders in uprising leaflets that any killings must have the approval of the revolt's leaders. `` They are not educated enough to be judges. They are working against the intefadeh,'' said one Fatah leader in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Two weeks ago, residents listened carefully to an appeal from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s radio station in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> urging more control in slayings of collaborators. They say the statement was clearly aimed at the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION>. Neither <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> nor uprising leaders have condemned collaborator killings outright, however, and there is widespread support for killing Palestinians who endanger the lives of activists by informing on them. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, in an interview early this month with a London-based Arabic-language newspaper, said he gave authority to uprising leaders to order murders of those proven to be collaborators. `` The unified command has the right to kill all those who cooperate with the enemy,'' he told the <PERSON> Al-Quds </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Arabia </PERSON>.

 <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s sexy sirens have grown up into savvy sophisticates for next spring's line of luxury ready-to-wear clothes. As other designers showed bare skin and molded cutout clothes for next spring, <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s look was downright ladylike. Following his off-the-wall couture collection last summer, he went to a looser, cooler mood. For this his many fans will be happy. Not that there are n't curves for next season. His line simply refines and streamlines some of his past fraught-with-detail ideas and hourglass shapes. Even the draped bustier flowered silks and the flirty peplum suits had a light touch. His patterns were softer, and the short sheaths caressed the body rather than constricting it to look like a vamp. The daytime separates, late-day black silk draped dresses and resort wear were much better than the unconvincing evening clothes, which resumed in a few sparkling lame drapes and black. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s high-powered shoulders have deflated into light padding for shape, with some mildly puffy sleeves. But there's still plenty of exuberance in fitted peplum or bolero checked jackets with pink or yellow piping, flowered print crepe skirts in shades of orange and blue. Some noteworthy touches for parties include the solid flared ankle-length shiny jersey skirts topped with fabulous, softly shaded paisley linen jackets and big pirate hats. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON> still flings colors and floral prints about like a zany mixmaster. But his combinations are good: the wild-flower fitted jackets, some with vests, look great with their sexy wrapped jersey blouses, lean plaid or checked skirts. The waists are always waspy-small and there is plenty of decollete to show off the chest. <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>'s easier, softer mood also produced a raft of shifts and smocky toppers with puffy sleeves, as well as some wonderful safari suits with easy, cropped wide pants. They looked restful but beautifully cut with firmly belted tunics and color combinations of prune, brown, violet and peach in soft linens. At <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON>, ready-to-wear designer <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Douvier </PERSON>'s sailor looks wo n't rock any boats, but they're jaunty and wearable. The organza-topped evening wear and sunny-side-up flower prints were a youthful synthesis of the polite side of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> clothes for next summer. Not wildly original, the house of <PERSON> Laroche </PERSON> regularly makes the grade with women who like to dress in quality-manufactured, big-name lines for a little less money. <PERSON> Bernadette </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, wife of the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> mayor, was in the audience, and unfailingly chooses a Laroche model or two. From smocky-topped sheer black and white print black-and-white pajama outfits to the giant poppies on fitted pique suits, there was a variety of colors and shapely lines in easy-to-wear clothes. The puffy and bowed organza toppers in hot yellow, turquoise and Indian rose or shocking pink with black crepe draped sheaths or lean pants are just in tune with the flouncy mood of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for next summer. The sophisticated but young clothes at the small house of Lecoanet-Hemant are still only available in a few shops, but their line will come out en masse and with serious distribution next spring thanks to Japanese backing. Their jazziest cruise wear came out in hot-colored Majorcan print cotton pedal pushers with eyelet-edged overblouses. Women headed to <LOCATION> Biarritz </LOCATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION> will like the curvaceous silk bicolored cocktail suits and body-conscious linen dresses with cut-outs. The original blue-brown damasked jeans teamed with a sequined, pearled box jacket gave a surprising grace note to this lilting collection. Madame <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mett </PERSON>, alias <PERSON> Torrente </PERSON>, launched a ready-to-wear line called `` Miss <PERSON> Torrente </PERSON>,'' calling it `` timeless classics for dynamic young women today.'' Like most other designers, she took a cruise with some pretty sailor suits, gold-buttoned at the shoulders. Her soft flower prints, puffed-sleeve silk dinner dresses, navy coat dresses would fit in nicely for lunch at <LOCATION> Angelina </LOCATION>'s, the tearoom where she showed the sleek, but unpretentious collection. Her nephew, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidus </PERSON>, son of <PERSON> Ted </PERSON>, put on his first big tent show at the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>. The 30-year-old designer, who has studied in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, has a fair way to go. The clothes were n't all bad, but the show was awkward. According to <PERSON> Lapidus </PERSON>' sister, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> is being backed by the former <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapidus </PERSON> money, as <PERSON> Lapidus </PERSON> himself bows quietly out. Young <PERSON> Lapidus </PERSON>' cotton sundresses and shorts jumpsuits in rust, saffron and other spicy colors looked fine for the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> if not for the smarter <LOCATION> Deauville </LOCATION> set. The fitted plaid or chevron jackets stiffened and curved out at hips were reminiscent of <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaultier </PERSON>, circa 1986. Better offerings in the uneven collection included the grape-like print skirts with loose overblouses and the iridescent graded mousseline tucked sleeveless sheaths.

 Conservative Republican Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON> fueled speculation Tuesday that he would be a candidate for president in 1996, saying he is considering a race for the White House at the end of his second term in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` If I ever heard the call, I would n't be afraid to answer the call,'' <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, 46, said in an interview. `` I do n't know whether it will come or not.

<TEXT>
 East Germans on Tuesday watched on live television what would have been unthinkable just weeks ago: members of the Communist-controlled parliament voting against the sole candidate for president. In all, 26 lawmakers voted against <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> while another 26 abstained _ making up more than 10 percent of the 500-seat People's Chamber It was the first time in the nation's 40-year history that the Communist Party-selected candidate for president got anything less than a unanimous vote, and the first time such proceedings were broadcast live. `` I always count badly,'' joked parliament speaker <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON> as he fumbled while tallying the show of hands. `` I do n't want any falsified results.'' While the 74-year-old Sindermann spoke in jest, the issue is extremely serious for the nation's growing opposition groups. They have accused the government of rigging regional elections last spring. <PERSON> Sindermann </PERSON>, a lifelong Communist and survivor of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' notorious <LOCATION> Mauthausen </LOCATION> concentration camp, said parliament should `` ban formalism'' in future meetings, suggesting more critical debate could be allowed in the chamber While some `` no'' votes may have been encouraged to give the impression the party represents a variety of opinions, thereby diluting opposition complaints the parliament is a rubber-stamp body, Tuesday's vote was a radical departure from the unanimous endorsements given all previous proposals by the ruling Politburo. `` Today's voting results speak for the necessary and new self-confidence of this high chamber,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said in his speech to the parliament, in an apparent reference to the signs of dissent among the ranks. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> reaffirmed the need for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to stick closely to its `` socialist foundation,'' but also spoke of the need for renewal in the troubled nation. The 52-year-old East German leader also promised an investigation into charges of police brutality during demonstrations earlier this month. Authorities later acknowledged for the first time there had been police attacks against peaceful pro-democracy protesters. While only time will tell whether any substantive reforms are undertaken, there already have been plenty of changes of style since <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> took over the more important job as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief a week ago. The broadcast of the voting for president displays the government's attempts to show it is interested in more openness after decades of repression of free speech. East German TV viewers watched pictures of a pro-democracy demonstration of 300,000 in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> on Monday, just hours after it occurred. The same night, they were able to view the party's ideology chief, <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hager </PERSON>, accuse former leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> of having encouraged `` elements of a personality cult'' during his 18 years of authoritarian rule On Saturday, two senior party officials engaged in a heated debate with demonstrators on an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> street, and portions of that exchange were broadcast on the main evening news. The change is enormous for TV viewers accustomed to being flooded with government attacks on the West and official attempts to contradict the West German TV shows that reach most of the communist nation. State-run newspapers also have been filled with growing numbers of critical voices, ranging from workers to artists. But while more people are being encouraged to talk openly, <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and his colleagues have made clear that the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will keep the `` leading role'' in the nation of 16.5 million people.

 Ethnic conflicts have killed 300 civilians and injured 5,260 since they erupted 20 months ago, an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Tuesday. The conflicts have prompted 360,000 people to flee their homes in fear, including Armenians, Azerbaijanis and Meskhetian Turks, said Col. Gen. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shatalin </PERSON>. Thousands of those homes have been set on fire, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s troops and police have suffered 890 casualties, including 12 deaths, he said. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the disputed territory at the focus of the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, remains virtually blockaded, <PERSON> Shatalin </PERSON> said. Only troop escorts permit the transport of food to the ethnically torn territory, he said. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is a primarily Armenian enclave within <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Armenians want it transferred to Armenian control and Azerbaijanis are resisting fiercely. Azerbaijanis blockaded the republic of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> as well this month, but troops were able to restore train traffic on the main line to <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, which runs through <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shatalin </PERSON> said the Supreme Soviet legislature is due to decide the fate of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> soon, but he fears that any decision will infuriate one side or the other. In the long-running Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, <PERSON> Shatalin </PERSON> said, the death toll is almost equally divided between the two nationalities.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> medicine has the means to prevent 10,000 infant deaths each year, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel Tuesday, but witnesses said obstacles keep many needy women from proper care. The women who need early care the most can rarely fit that care into their lives because poverty forces them to be preoccupied with the struggle for personal survival, witnesses told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> and Families. Women who do seek care must travel long distances, changing buses several times, for just a brief appointment, witnesses said. `` When one stops to consider the many problems they face, including lack of basic necessities of life, long waits in a busy clinic, to spend a few minutes with a doctor they have never seen before, who uses technical terms they do not understand, and who has to hurry to see the next patient perhaps the question should not be ` why do n't they?' but ` why do they?''' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poland </PERSON>, a nurse and anthropologist on the faculty of the <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` When they are faced with a choice between waiting for a welfare check to buy basic necessities before the money is stolen or to keep a prenatal appointment _ prenatal care becomes less important,'' she said. Doctors, on the other hand, complain that they are hamstrung by the rise in malpractice lawsuits and insurance premiums, especially severe among obstetricians. Doctors also complain that Medicaid _ the state-administered health care system for the poor _ is underfunded and caught up in red tape. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, the acting surgeon general and assistant secretary for health in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said the administration is trying to tackle the worst problems. `` We estimate that we could save 10,000 of the 40,000 babies who die each year, just by applying what we already know about things like case management, outreach and home visiting,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. There are 4 million babies born in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year, and the infant mortality rate _ the rate of infants who die within a year of birth _ ranks this country 22nd among industrialized nations. For the short term, <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had submitted a budget proposal that would expand the number of low-income women eligible for Medicaid. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said that an interdepartmental commission he chairs will give the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> recommendations in the next two months `` to achieve better coordination among the extensive array of existing programs.'' Among the solutions being advanced is `` one-stop shopping'' in which health and various social services are located under one roof. `` One-stop shopping is based on the premise that by allowing eligibility for AFDC -LRB- welfare -RRB-, Medicaid and other social services to be determined at the same time and at the same site that health care is delivered, there will be an increased likelihood that the poor pregnant woman will receive the full range of services which she needs and to which she is entitled,'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said. Other witnesses said the issue is deeper rooted and must be tackled in part with sex education beginning in grade school. Witnesses complained that the loss of neighborhoods and neighborhood-oriented medical practices along with the growth in government medical programs has also created a bureaucratic, impersonal medical system.

 The House today moved toward passage of a $ 2.85 billion relief plan for earthquake-damaged <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> after the White House announced its support for the package. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> lawmakers said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill was n't nearly enough, although it exceeded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration estimates. But the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would sign the bill. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration could support the $ 2.85 billion relief package approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, calling it `` pretty close to ours.'' Actually, new federal spending would be nearly twice what the administration proposed. The president's budget office had said that about $ 1 billion from existing federal programs should be applied to quake relief so only about $ 1.5 billion in new spending would be needed. `` We were hit by ten times the amount of explosive power of World War II, including the atomic bomb,'' Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif., whose district is in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, said as debate began `` Please give us a chance to rebuild.'' Before voting on the spending, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 401-18 to strike from the bill a provision exempting the disaster expenditures from the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. It was largely a show vote, however, as the Gramm-Rudman calculations for this year are already in place. The aid package could still be modified in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s senators were ready to push for more money on Wednesday. The bill was expected to get speedy passage, because it was attached to a stopgap spending bill that must be passed before Thursday to avoid a government shutdown. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved the aid plan Monday and sent it to the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> for action today after rejecting the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation's request for $ 3.8 billion. The spending committee rejected, 26-7, an amendment supported by the state delegation and instead favored a proposal by chairman <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., which essentially split the difference between the state and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> plans The committee approved $ 1.1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to repair the devastation and $ 1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s emergency fund. Most of the deaths and the worst damage from last week's quake in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area was related to highways. In addition, $ 500 million would be given to the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> for emergency loans, and $ 250 million to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to spend at his discretion on other operations. Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation's point man in the committee, said the state would keep pressing in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and on future legislation to get more aid. `` Certainly, $ 2.8 billion is not bad,'' he said, but added it was only a start. `` I do n't think we've done the job yet. <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> said he was especially concerned that the committee did n't waive time limits for aid requests and other federal requirements he said would be difficult for local authorities to meet The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation request included the $ 1.1 billion for <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> and $ 1 billion for the highway emergency fund. But it wanted $ 1.2 billion for <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> loans, a $ 100 million loan fund for poor people, and a $ 400 million discretionary fund for the president. The White House, by contrast, said earlier that the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> should handle the disaster out of its existing funds, sought no presidential fund, and wanted $ 600 million for the federal share of repairing the highways. In all, the $ 2.5 billion administration proposal included just $ 1.5 billion in spending above what was already in the federal budget. Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., the senior Republican on the committee, and others at the committee meeting complained that the powerful <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> delegation was asking for too much too soon Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Livingston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-La </LOCATION>., proposed and then withdrew an amendment giving his home state $ 5 billion to compensate for all the hurricanes it has suffered since the turn of the century `` We are the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> and I think there is a certain amount of jealousy,'' <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON> said afterward. The Californians said their estimates of the damage were more than $ 7 billion and climbing. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said he would consider a request for more money later. `` My whole pitch is to do something now, straighten it out later, and do n't waste any money in the meantime,'' he said. `` We do n't attempt to put all the money in here it's going to take. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quake came on the heels of Hurricane Hugo, which devastated <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> islands and parts of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is putting federal dollars to work on both disasters but in both cases is dodging its budget rules, which say that the cost of new programs should n't be lopped on the federal debt. But with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promising to veto any new taxes, and neither the administration nor <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> offering any significant spending cuts, the deficit is heading up again.

 Leaders of the 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> ended a stormy weeklong summit Tuesday, joining the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in giving <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> six months to make drastic changes before imposing sanctions. But dissent by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, a major South African trade partner, left a gaping hole in the Commonwealth stance. It meant the organization of former colonies, long painfully obsessed with apartheid, still looks less of a threat than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the white-run government. Spurred by what she described as a `` important and positive changes'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> redoubled her lone battle against sanctions during the meeting. The upshot was a public sparring match between Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and the others, led by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, after she issued _ without telling them _ a lengthy repudiation of the summit's declaration on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> announced Sunday. The declaration itself, which Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> signed, incorporated her objections to key provisions. They call for tighter financial measures immediately and stipulate that a nine-member foreign ministers' committee will meet in April to gauge how far <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s new president, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, has moved. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the declaration's main authors, thought the dissenting note in the final text should have been enough _ or at least Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> should have told them she would be issuing a separate repudiation. `` If we all behaved like this, every <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> document would be a shambles and it would n't be worth very much,'' said Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. `` We were n't forewarned. We were blind-sided,'' he added as the main antagonists let loose more recriminations at news conferences before heading home Tuesday. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> countered that the others were being `` absolutely ridiculous. ... These people who make use of free speech must expect others to do the same.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> committee's meeting next April is to gauge whether <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has embarked on `` irreversible'' change by that time. Canadian External Affairs Secretary <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, the committee chairman, said that would include drawing up legislation to repeal the basic tenets of apartheid that deny the black majority the vote and enshrine racial segregation of land. Similarly, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said this month that unless de Klerk takes legislative action by June to end apartheid, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will consider new measures. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will consult with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, its <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> about tougher sanctions `` if, after the next -LRB- South African -RRB- parliamentary session, there is very little to show for it,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. The next session of the white-dominated South African Parliament begins in February and ends in June. Like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> summit did not specify any new measures. Anti-apartheid groups want coal, oil and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s huge diamond mining industry targeted. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has already left the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> well behind on sanctions because <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> resists them and black southern African countries, mainly <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> members such as <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, depend on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> economically. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> in practice is in step with me ... in what it says, we take a different view,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> commented in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. Under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> legislation passed in 1986 after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> overrode a veto by then-President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has imposed the strictest embargoes of any major South African trading partner. They include bans on the imports of fruit, vegetables, grain, mineral fuels, uranium and radio active materials. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s two biggest trading partners are <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, followed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A list of 11 non-binding embargoes agreed to in 1986 by the Commonwealth _ except <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ included a ban on air links, agricultural products, tourist promotion and imports of uranium, coal, iron and steel. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> imposed only a few token measures as a gesture to the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION>, which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> quit in 1961. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> opposes sanctions in principle, saying they hurt blacks most and strengthen white resistance to change. Some critics, particularly African nations, charge she is worried about British investments, does n't want to lose the trade, and is sympathetic toward <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>.

 Israeli troops shot and killed two guerrillas in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-declared security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the military command said. The clash north of <LOCATION> Majayoun </LOCATION>, four miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border, came hours after the army said Israeli-backed militiamen shot and killed two other armed guerrillas in the security zone. An army spokesman said an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> force on a routine patrol of the zone's central sector spotted a guerrilla squad and opened fire, attacking it from a short distance and killing two guerrillas. The Israeli unit suffered no casualties, the spokesman said. No further details were released. Military officials said Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifles, hand grenades and explosives were found near the guerrillas' bodies. The officials were unable to say if the victims in the clashes Monday and Tuesday were Palestinian or Lebanese guerrillas. Both Palestinian and Lebanese militias have attacked <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and their militia allies in the Israeli-controlled zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. No organization has claimed responsibility for the attacks on the Israeli unit or the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which is trained, armed and financed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Foreign reports have said about 500 Israeli soldiers patrol the security zone, which covers 328 square miles, along with the militia force made up mostly of Lebanese Christians. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the buffer zone to protect its northern border against guerrilla attacks in June 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after a three-year occupation.

<HEAD>Park Service Won't Allow Timber Convoys Through Yellowstone</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> says it will not allow commercial timber hauling through Yellowstone Park, despite a request by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Parks Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> denied the request this week on the advice on lawyers who said it was against federal law, spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` There is a park regulation that prohibits commercial transport across park roadways,'' said <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> also was concerned that a lumber company's plan to transport about 20,000 truckloads of logs through the park would have adverse impacts on important grizzly bear, elk and bison habitats as well as roadways, said the spokesman. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which sold the timber, indicated to the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> that there was an emergency need to go through <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lawyers disagreed, saying that the need did not meet the standards required to constitute an emergency. Environmentalists were waiting for <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON>'s decision as the first big test of his willingness to protect the parks from commercial assault. `` I think the Park Service is to be commended,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. `` It did the right thing.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said he was glad <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON> did not accept the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that an `` economic emergency'' existed to justify the hauling. `` It would have set a very serious precedent,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. He said that if the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had prevailed, private owners who were watching the action would have come forth with similar requests. `` People expect when they enter the boundaries of Yellowstone Park that things will be different, a world dominated more by nature than the works of civilization,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. The timber to be hauled is from national forests bordering <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> and amounts to about 40 million board feet from trees that were partially burned by fires that blazed through the park last year.

<HEAD>Stalin Biographer: Return to the Dictator's Methods a Possibility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The general who wrote the first Soviet biography of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> said Tuesday there could be a return to the brutal dictator's methods if <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms do n't show tangible results. `` Literally speaking, I rule out a repetition -LRB- of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> -RRB-,'' Col. Gen. <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON> said. `` But a certain return to conservatism is not excluded, of course.'' <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON>, 61, appeared at a government-sponsored news conference to present his four-volume `` political portrait'' of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> titled `` Triumph and Tragedy.'' The book, said by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency to be the first Soviet biography of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, has been printed in an initial Russian-language edition of 300,000 copies. <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON>'s work was 10 years in the making and he was given unprecedented access to previously secret archives, said the author, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. His remarks to reporters indicate his 1,344-page work, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, conforms to the new official view of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> as a bloody tyrant, instead of the former version of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> as the architect of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s wartime victory over the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and the country's industrializer. `` The main thing for him was power; his credo was violence, physical and ideological,'' <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON> said. In response to a reporter's question, he estimated that from 21 million to 22 million Soviets were unlawfully imprisoned, sent into internal exile or wrongfully convicted during <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s 29-year reign as Soviet leader. Of that number, `` more than two-thirds perished,'' <PERSON> Volkognov </PERSON> said. He said his calculations were based on the capacity of Stalin-era prisons, labor camps and `` shooting chambers'' where the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police carried out executions. In preparation for his book, <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON> said he met with hundreds of people who had known or worked with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, among them former members of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION>, secretaries of the party's policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, marshals of the armed forces, people's commissars and members of the dictator's entourage Asked if another <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> could arise in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON> said history excludes `` a total repetition.'' But he said the apparent failure of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms could trigger a conservative reaction. `` Attempts to preserve this Stalinist system, attempts to return to some of his methods, are not excluded in principle,'' <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON> said. `` To exclude them altogether, we need to do a lot. First of all, our society needs like air at least some success to be felt in any sphere _ social, agricultural, anywhere _ in order to infuse new hope in the future success of the changes.'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also needs political mechanisms `` that would guarantee against a return to the past,'' he said without elaborating. For almost two decades, <PERSON> Volkogonov </PERSON> served in the Main Political Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, but he said he gave that job up to work on the book.

 Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> has accepted in principle a proposal by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiations, but with the proviso that the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> be excluded and the agenda restricted, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> welcomed <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and said it ` ` reinforces what we believe _ that they are engaged and that they are working really hard to try to bridge these gaps. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five-point proposal is designed to attract the support of the Arabs to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. Its key elements include assurances to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> it would have to be `` satisfied'' with the composition of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation and that a three-way meeting would be held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> afterward. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which is serving as a middle-man to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, would attend. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, while touring the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, called the recent stepped-up exchange with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration positive. `` I do n't see any large gap between our views and the proposals of the secretary of state,'' he told reporters. `` But there are some differences.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposition stressed those differences and threatened to protest its government's stand by staging a walkout in parliament. `` I do n't see anything in <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s proposal that needs to be changed,'' said <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, the Labor leader who is also finance minister. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said of <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' letter, delivered Monday night by Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>: `` Obviously, it is a signal, it is confirmation, it is evidence they are taking this seriously.'' She said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> had telephoned <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> on Tuesday, while the foreign minister was in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, and had also talked to Egyptian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Esmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meguid </PERSON> by phone to <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. `` He is not overly pessimistic, he is not overly optimistic about this,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. `` He is very realistic about this.'' `` We believe the Israelis are working hard to advance this process, and without saying they have accepted or rejected <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five points, it is obvious they are seriously exploring a way to bridge the gap to reach aqgreement on a framework,'' she said Asked if <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was flexible on his five points, the spokeswoman replied: `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> is not an unreasonable person.'' One of <PERSON> Arens </PERSON>' provisos was that <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> provide assurances that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, whose charter calls for dismantling the Jewish state, would not participate in the Israeli-Palestinian talks, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaron </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said. The second, she said, was that the meeting be restricted to arrangements for the election. The Palestinians elected on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> would then negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> a five-year plan for limited self-rule. At the end of that trial period, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the Palestinians would work out an overall settlement. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would agree to the <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> plan `` after the changes we proposed are accepted.'' The prime minister added: `` In a few days we will know if there is an agreement or not.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> and other members of the <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> coalition have sought from the outset to preclude the talks turning into negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> or turning to issues other than arrangements for carrying out the elections. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, meeting last week in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, said only the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> could represent the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and it chose a delegation. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Tuesday, however, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had not rejected <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s five points. While only the three-way <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> meeting has been made public, the four other points are known to provide that: _ Talks be held between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and Palestinians. _ The meeting would concern elections. _ <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is to be `` satisfied'' with the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation's composition. _ <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> is free to consult any Middle Eastern parties about the makeup of the delegation.

 A judge today sentenced actress <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> to three days in jail and ordered her to pay more than $ 12,000 in fines and restitution for slapping a police officer. `` If you strike a cop, you go to jail,'' Municipal Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> told Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> in sentencing her for battery on a police officer, driving without a valid driver's license and having an open container of alcohol in her car. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> also fined the Hungarian actress $ 2,350, ordered her to pay $ 10,000 in restitution to the city of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and its police department and directed her to perform 120 hours of community service in a shelter for homeless women. He gave Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> a 24-month jail sentence, but suspended that to four days and gave her credit for the day she served after being arrested June 14. `` The law applies equally to everybody, whether they're rich or poor and whether they're famous or not,'' the judge said, ordering her to serve the three-day sentence before Dec. 29 and allowing no possibility of early release. Earlier, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> denied a motion by Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s new attorney, <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Bull </PERSON>. In setting the conditions for her community service, the judge ordered Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> not to say anything to anyone about the case or give interviews while performing her community service, and asked reporters to stay away from her. As <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> lectured Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> about having an open bottle of whiskey in her Rolls-Royce Corniche, she laughed, earning her a rebuke from the judge. The judge said Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s action `` verbally slapped the faces of every cop.'' `` She was not satisfied with that. She turned around and slapped the face of every American by comparing justice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to Communist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' the judge said. Before sentencing, Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> argued for a tough sentence. `` How dare the defendant suggest that she waws not tried by a jury of her peers? ... `` How dare she suggest they do not understand the class of people that she comes from?'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> argued. He said Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s antics during trial `` Suggested that this is a joke ... she had no respect for the process.'' In his motion for a mistrial, <ORGANIZATION> Bull </ORGANIZATION> argued that Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> was n't properly defended during trial by previous counsel <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> But <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> ruled that <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON>'s defense was competent, and refused to declare a mistrial. Bull then began calling character witnesses for Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, including charity fundraiser and entertainment industry publicist <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Luchenbill </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> listened to witnesses with her chin thrust up, and at one point sprayed herself with a new dose of perfume. Bull earlier called on R.G. <PERSON> Markle </PERSON>, who identified himself as an expert in legal ethics, to back up a contention that <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> sought out Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> in order to gain favorable publicity for his law practice. Bull then called <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON>, who testified under questioning by <PERSON> Bull </PERSON> that `` I took the case for several reasons, and one of them was for the publicity.'' <PERSON> Graysen </PERSON> also said he thought the case would be interesting, that he admired Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, and he believed there may have been some wrongdoing by police in the matter. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> arrived at court this morning in a black dress, stepping from a black Mercedes Benz with her husband and telling about 100 reporters and camera crew members, `` Of course, I'm nervous. She explained the dress by saying `` My stepfather just died,'' referring to her mother's third husband, <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Szigethy </PERSON>, who died Sept. 30. A jury on Sept. 29 convicted Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> of battery on a police officer, driving without a valid driver's license and having an open container of alcohol in her car. She was acquitted of failing to obey an officer. The maximum possible sentence for the misdemeanor conviction was 18 months in prison and a $ 3,500 fine. District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> urged a 30-day jail sentence, a fine of more than $ 3,000 plus $ 14,000 to compensate the <ORGANIZATION> Beverly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for its costs. But <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> had dismissed the idea of a jail term after her conviction, saying she was too old to serve time. `` I ca n't believe this is happening to me,'' <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, who is secretive about her age but according to court documents is 66, said in a telephone interview Monday night. `` I'm 100 percent innocent.'' She said she spent the evening at home, `` feeding my five dogs and my German husband,'' <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Anhalt </PERSON>. `` We were invited to a dinner party but I ca n't go out. I've got to get up early in the morning,'' she said. During the trial, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> told reporters she was afraid to go to jail because jails are filled with lesbians. She later apologized, saying, `` I got letter from the lesbian and gay association. They are going to boycott me because I say there are lesbians in jail. Imagine a women's jail, there must be lesbians ... maybe I should become a lesbian. What do I know? I like men.'' The three-week trial cost $ 30,000. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, unhappy with what he called a courthouse `` media circus,'' had been eager to recoup trial expenses instead.

 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, the television evangelist who lost his <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> empire in a sex and money scandal, was sentenced to 45 years in prison and fined $ 500,000 today for a federal fraud and conspiracy conviction. `` I'm deeply sorry for those I have hurt,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said before he was sentenced by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>. `` I have sinned. But never in my life did I intend to defraud.'' Neither side presented witnesses during the hearing, which began at 2 p.m. and ended shortly after 3 p.m. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> rose with his attorney, <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, when <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> sentenced him. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> shook his head in disbelief while a federal prosecutor presented arguments, as did his daughter, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, did not attend the court session. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could be eligible for parole in 10 years. He was immediately taken into custody and was to be taken to the federal correctional facility in <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. His lawyers have said since his conviction that they would appeal <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, the church secretary whose sexual tryst with <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> led to the hush money scandal that caused him to lose control of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, said in a television interview that she was not satisfied with the sentence. `` In my opinion, I still feel like it wo n't add up to the years that people worked to save up money to give to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 49, was convicted Oct. 5 of 24 counts charging he defrauded followers of his television ministry, selling lodging guarantees at his Christian retreat when he knew rooms were n't available Followers sent more than $ 158 million to become `` lifetime partners,'' which was supposed to give them annual lodging rights for the rest of their lives. The jury found that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> used more than $ 3.7 million to buy luxurious homes, fancy cars, jewelry and expensive vacations. In a sentencing memo, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> fraud specialist <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> be ordered to pay restitution. Unsettled claims total between $ 90 million to $ 100 million, according to lawyers representing the partners. Prosecutors said when <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was indicted that the maximum fine could be more than $ 5 million. But when they filed the recommendation, they cited the Criminal Fine Enforcement Act of 1984, which allows a maximum fine to be no more than twice the highest fine allowed for any count in the case. Since <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> faced 21 counts carrying maximum $ 250,000 fines and three carrying maximum $ 1,000 fines, the memo said the highest fine <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>, known as `` Maximum Bob'' for his stiff sentences, could set was $ 500,000. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> faced a maximum sentence of 120 years. The memorandum did not specify a recommended sentence but cited a number of cases. Prosecutors said in the memo the sentence should be more than the longest of those cases, which was 40 years. `` Every time there was a fork in the road and one led to a lighter sentence and one led to a heavier sentence, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> took the one that led to the heavier sentence,'' former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said before the sentencing. `` When <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> got on the courthouse steps and said he was not guilty and showed a complete lack of remorse and contrition that's going to hurt him. That means a lot to Judge <PERSON> Potter </PERSON>.'' Prosecutors said a tough prison sentence would show that white-collar criminals `` will not be dealt with less harshly than those criminals who have neither the wit nor the position to commit crimes other than those of violence.'' The prosecutors said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has not assumed responsibility for his crimes. `` The defendant's lack of remorse suggests little potential for meaningful rehabilitation and demonstrates an increased likelihood of recidivism,'' the prosecutors wrote. `` Since leaving <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> has shown a willingness to continue his solicitation of support through the use of half truths and misrepresentations. ... `` A substantial term of imprisonment would impress upon the defendant the gravity of his offenses and the need to refrain from similar conduct in the future,'' the prosecutors said. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> attached character references from <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> supporters to his three-page sentencing recommendation and urged the judge to consider alternatives to prison. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> asked the court to `` temper its justice with mercy and consider reasonable alternatives and allow this defendant the benefit of the court's compassion and mercy.'' During the trial, which began Aug. 28 and lasted nearly six weeks, defense attorneys had called 75 witnesses, including more than 50 who were loyal <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> supporters. Prosecutors called more than 100 witnesses, including many lifetime partners who had sent money _ usually $ 1,000 _ to obtain free mini-vacations at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s 2,400-acre Christian retreat in nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, S.C.

<HEAD>Senate Opens Abortion Debate; Issue Referred For Constitutional Test</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Abortion Bill</HEAD>

 Parliament on Tuesday began debating a bill that would end a 122-year-old ban on abortions in this overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nation of 10 million people. `` The issue is painful and divides us by its conflict of values, the right to life and the distress of women,'' said <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayence </PERSON>, a conservative but pro-abortion senator who opened the debate. `` Nobody wants to promote abortion,'' she said, but added, `` the ban is inapplicable, particularly because of public opinion ... and new legislation in neighboring countries which leads to ` abortion tourism.''' Public opinion polls show most Belgians favor abortions. The bill before the 184-member senate was preceded by 30 similar measures in the past 15 years that all failed to win legislative approval. The latest would let a woman have an abortion before her 12th week of pregnancy if she is in a `` state of distress.'' Under Belgian law, women who have abortions, and doctors who perform them, risk jail terms of up to 10 years. Yet enforcement of the law has been spotty and the courts have issued very lenient penalties to offenders in recent years. An estimated 15,000 abortions are performed in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> each year with hospitals reporting these as womb surgery to allow women to be reimbursed by the social security system. As debate opened, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaelen </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat, sent the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> for a ruling on whether it conforms with the constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>, a legal panel that acts as a constitutional court, was asked to issue its ruling by week's end. <PERSON> Swaelen </PERSON>'s move did not suspend the debate. But it will delay a final <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> vote until next month and reflected abortion opposition within Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The latest bill was adopted by two <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committees but has opened opened up a rift within <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Socialists and a Flemish nationalist party. No government minister attended Tuesday's debate. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, especially in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s Dutch-speaking northern half, are almost unanimously opposed to legalizing abortions. The Socialists are in favor as are the opposition Conservatives. After the <ORGANIZATION> senate </ORGANIZATION> has voted on the abortion bill, the issue must still win approval of the dominant 212-member <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> where <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' government occupies 150 seats. The abortion debate really began 16 years ago when Dr. <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Peers </PERSON>, head of a maternity ward at a <LOCATION> Namur </LOCATION> hospital, announced he regularly performed abortions. He was jailed briefly but never tried. His action set off a pro-abortion campaign that led prosecutors to suspend some cases and judges to acquit or give light sentences to offenders who were prosecuted. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> must thus put law in conformity with social and legal reality,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Mayence </PERSON>. She added that the bill would not establish abortion on demand, but permit it in certain circumstances. Abortions could only take place after the 12th week of pregnancy if the foetus suffered from serious, incurable diseases or the life of the mother was in danger. The bill also stipulates that abortions must only be carried out in approved hospitals or medical centers.

 Afghan jets bombed central Afghan cities and guerrilla strongholds to try to halt attacks on supply lines to besieged cities, Western diplomats said Tuesday. U.S.-backed Moslem guerrilla sources claimed that since the weekend, 1,500 soldiers and 700 armed militiamen defected to the self-proclaimed guerrilla government based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The report could not be independently confirmed. One Western diplomat, speaking in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> on condition he not be identified, said high-altitude cluster bombs rained down in recent days on villages and guerrilla positions along the <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, which links the capital <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION>, 100 miles southeast. There were no immediate casualty reports. Diplomats said guerrillas have stopped a 200-vehicle supply convoy on the <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Mohammad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aga </LOCATION>, 18 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The government convoy stuck at <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Aga </PERSON> reportedly left the capital about two weeks ago and is headed toward the embattled garrison town of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. Guerrillas launched an offensive against <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> more than two months ago but fighting is deadlocked. A guerrilla source, known only as <PERSON> Amanullah </PERSON>, corroborated reports of heavy bombing along the <LOCATION> Logar </LOCATION> road but said about 60 percent of the villages were already reduced to rubble in bombing raids during the early years of the war. Most civilians from the area moved to neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where more than 3 million refugees have fled from the decade-long battle between Soviet-backed communist troops and the Moslem insurgents. Diplomats, quoting guerrilla sources, said guerrilla fighters hit a government convoy traveling on the strategic <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, linking <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Guerrillas claimed to have destroyed more than 20 vehicles and captured 30 others, including tanks and armored personnel carriers, in last week's attack. Diplomats and rebel sources said the road between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> has been blocked by guerrilla fighters since Sept. 25. The 75-mile stretch of highway is critical for the government to resupply the beseiged city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. A guerrilla spokesman, who uses the single name <PERSON> Iqbal </PERSON>, said 1,500 army troops deserted their positions in eastern <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> province on Monday The 700 militiamen defected on the weekend from 20 outposts in northern <LOCATION> Samangan </LOCATION> province, guerrilla sources said. The defection weakened a security ring around the northern town of <LOCATION> Robatak </LOCATION>, they said.

<HEAD>Report Says 11 Percent of Young People's Deaths Caused by Guns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A government report showing that guns cause 11 percent of young people's deaths underscores the need to lower teen-age homicide rates, especially among blacks, Health Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said Tuesday. Since 1968, homicide has been the leading cause of death for black males aged 15 to 19. From 1984 to 1987, the rate for this group jumped 53 percent _ to 60 deaths per 100,000, the report said. Firearms are responsible for about eight in 10 of these deaths, the report said. The report, `` Firearm Mortality Among Children and Youth,'' was released in conjunction with the premiere of a television documentary on youth homicide, produced by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The program is being offered to stations nationwide. The statistics show that `` we are losing our youth _ not only to disease _ but increasingly to injury and violence,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` Just as we have controlled so many childhood diseases, we must now mount an equally aggressive campaign to rid our children's lives of the causes and tools of injury and violence,'' the secretary said in a statement accompanying the report The report by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> counted 3,392 firearm-related deaths among children aged 1 to 19 in 1987 _ about 11 percent of all childhood deaths. Among children aged 1 to 4, guns accounted for about 1 percent of deaths, but the proportion rose to 17 percent among teen-agers, the report said. For children aged 1 to 9, homicide and unintentional shooting deaths each accounted for about half of all firearm deaths. Among those aged 10 to 14, shooting deaths were about equally divided among suicide, homicide and unintentional shootings. Of the firearm deaths among teen-agers, about 48 percent were homicides, 42 percnt were suicides and 8 percent were unintentional shootings. Teen-age boys are six times as likely as teen-age girls to die in a shooting, the report said. Among black teen-agers, 41 percent of deaths are associated with firearms, compared with 16 percent for white male teen-agers. The frequency of firearm-related deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> changed little from 1968 to 1987, except among teen-agers, for whom the death rate over the period rose from 10 per 100,000 to nearly 15 per 100,000. The overall rate decreased for children aged 1 to 4 during the period.

<HEAD>Priest Plans Service for Poles Slain by Secret Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> priest plans to hold religious ceremonies for up to 3,000 people who were murdered by secret police during the Stalinist era and buried near his church. `` These people were deprived of a Christian burial, therefore the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> church has a totally special obligation to fulfill this -LRB- funeral -RRB- ritual,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Maj </PERSON>, parish priest at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, told state television Monday. He said lectures and ceremonies would be held Thursday through Saturday, with a funeral service Saturday night. He also appealed to people to provide any information they have that could `` broaden our knowledge'' about the Poles killed as communism was imposed throughout the country. A cleaning last fall of the archives of the Roman Catholic church revealed that 500 to 3,000 people slain by Polish secret police from 1946 to 1956 were buried in the parish cemetery, the television report said. The examination of the church archives was reported in the Polish press last year, but at that time the Stalinist repression in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after World War II was a taboo subject for the official media. The existence of a mass grave in the Sluzewiec cemetery had been known for years even though the victims were buried secretly. Names of the victims have not been released by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and many have not been identified. Thousands of Poles who were accused of resisting communist rule were arrested, held without trial, tortured and killed as Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> enforced his domination over East-bloc countries controlled by the Soviet army. Among those slain were members of the underground Home Army that had fought the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> and was under the command of the Polish government-in-exile in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> broke relations with the government-in-exile in 1943. The television news commentator said it is probable that among the victims buried in the cemetery are a Home Army general and a group of teen-age Boy Scouts who fought in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Uprising against the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in the closing days of World War II. The commentator said it had been determined that the youngest person buried in the parish cemetery was 17 years old.

<HEAD>Report Estimates 600 Killed Because Of 65 mph Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The 65 mph speed limit may have killed 600 people on rural Interstates, some due to a sharp increase in drivers in some states who travel at extremely high speeds, according to a government report. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said states with the higher speed limit on rural freeways for two years showed an estimated 31 percent increase in fatalities on those roads. The report, dated Monday, estimated that 309 more people died in 1987 and 591 in 1988 than would have been expected based on the historical trend before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> allowed the higher speed limit. About two-thirds of the increase _ 600 deaths _ could be attributed to speed, the report said, and the remainder to increased traffic. Results varied widely from state to state, however, and the report said the number of deaths was so low in some cases that the changes were not statistically significant. In <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>, for example, fatalities on rural Interstates increased 800 percent, from 2 in 1986 to 18 in 1988. But the report said that could have been due to chance, or factors other than speed. In 17 states, death tolls on affected highways were 50 percent or more higher than in 1986, when the speed limit was 55 mph, said the report. On the other hand, six states with 65 mph limits showed decreases in fatalities on rural Interstates and the eight states that retained the 55 mph limit averaged a 10 percent increase in fatalities on such roads over the two years. Speed monitoring data from 18 of the states that increased the speed limit showed that 11 times as many vehicles were traveling faster than 80 miles per hour than two years ago. Three times as many were traveling faster than 70 mph, the report said. The agency earlier concluded that the 55 mph limit dramatically curtailed the number of drivers using excessive speed and even lowered average speeds on some roads posted below 55 mph. The gap between the speeds of the slowest and fastest traffic on the road also increased on roads posted at 65 mph, the new report said. `` The effects of these two changes were to increase the likelihood and severity of traffic collisions,'' the report said. The agency made no recommendation on the speed limit, noting that the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> `` continues to believe that states are in the best position to make decisions on both posted speed limits and enforcement.'' <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, said the government report confirms data it compiled earlier. `` There should n't be a question any longer _ deaths have increased because of higher speed limits,'' <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> said. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> sent a letter last month to all governors calling for a national campaign to discourage speeding, but said states could determine appropriate speed limits. The report said that despite the increase on rural highways, Interstates remain the safest highways in the country, with fewer fatalities for the miles traveled than other roads. Accidents on rural Interstates killed 2,836 people in 1988, or about 6 percent of the 47,079 fatalities on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> roads. Overall, fatalities were up 1.5 percent on all roads, but the number of deaths per 100,000 miles traveled remained at the 1987 level of 2.4, which is an all-time low. The country has 29,808 miles of Interstate highway on which the speed limit has been increased to 65 mph. States which have retained the 55 mph limit are <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> have no rural Interstates.

 The Soviet foreign minister pledged Tuesday on his first visit to the new Solidarity government to maintain key fuel supplies, and Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said he will travel next month to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. In addition, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will try to uncover the truth about the World War II massacre of thousands of Polish officers at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>. The issue has long been a sore point in <LOCATION> Polish-Soviet </LOCATION> relations. Upon arrival at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Okecie </LOCATION> airport, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said, `` The Soviet leadership places a lot of importance'' on his visit to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>. He was met by Polish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Skubiszewski </PERSON>, a professor of international law and Solidarity sympathizer, who told <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>: `` This is an important visit for us. We have high expectations for it.'' They held two rounds of talks before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> went to the Council of Ministers to meet <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, a former Solidarity editor who became the first non-communist to lead an East bloc government on Aug. 24. `` I am very happy about our many-faceted talk,'' <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> said after his two-hour meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` I accepted the invitation to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> with gratitude,'' and said he expected to leave for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Nov. 23. Polish officials say the important items on the agenda with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were restructuring economic relations between <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as part of a drive to create a market economy, resolution of historical `` blank spots'' and easing of contacts between Polish and Soviet citizens. `` There are some problems, but they were discussed in the spirit of understanding and seeking solutions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Staniszewski </PERSON> said after the meeting, which he said focused on economic problems and new forms of cooperation. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> will meet with Polish officials again Wednesday before holding discussions Thursday and Friday in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact foreign ministers. According to <PERSON> Staniszewski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> pledged the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would maintain its level of deliveries to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, which is dependent on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> for oil, gas, electricity and raw materials. It was a significant gesture of good will because <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has been having trouble delivering products to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> due to its protracted economic crisis, which includes a shotage of industrial goods, high inflation and a $ 39 billion foreign debt. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has said it wants to renegotiate its contracts with its trading partners in the Soviet-led <ORGANIZATION> Comecon </ORGANIZATION> alliance to make them more market-oriented. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>'s election. Two days after <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> took office, <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Kryuchkov </PERSON> met with him and called him a `` solid man.'' The Soviet decision not to interfere in the assumption of power by a Solidarity government, relayed by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in a telephone call to Polish Communist First Secretary <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> on Aug. 22, marked a significant departure from Soviet treatment of its East bloc allies. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> underlined this point Monday in a major foreign policy speech in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, saying that as <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> countries move away from one-party rule, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would observe principles of non-intervention and `` absolute freedom of choice.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest trade partner, and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have led the way in implementing democratic reform in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. But <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> and his Solidarity-led cabinet have promised to respect the country's military obligations to the Soviet-led alliance.

<HEAD>High School Reinstates Lyrics of Fight Song After Racist Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEKIN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Officials at a high school here reinstated a 25-year-old fight chant one month after it was shelved when a student complained that it contained a subliminal salute to the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. `` To say that an innocent cadence, which happens to have a ` K-K-K' in it, is racist is stretching things a little bit,'' said <PERSON> Chic </PERSON> <PERSON> Renner </PERSON>, school board president, on Tuesday. A student complained on Sept. 18 about the traditional chant at <ORGANIZATION> Pekin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Superintendant <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON> agreed and ordered changes in the final line of the chant: `` P-P-P-E-K, K-K-K-I-N. P-E-K, K-I-N. <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION> The new lyrics spelled out `` Dragon,'' the school mascot. But officials said fans found the chant awkward. <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON> said he and principal <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON> reconsidered the issue last Thursday and decided they had gone too far in ordering it re-written. `` I thought the original decision was correct, but it seemed <PERSON> Rees </PERSON> and I were the only ones who thought so,'' <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON> said. `` Some people felt that maybe we had over-reacted.'' <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON> said Tuesday he still believes the `` <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION>'' chant, with its repetition of `` K-K-K,'' contains a racist overtone `` if viewed in a narrow context.'' `` But we decided that no racism was intended and that maybe we over-reacted, so we changed it back,'' <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON> said. `` I hope this is the end of it.'' <LOCATION> Pekin </LOCATION> is sensitive to the racism issue after allegations that black students from <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> were harassed by students from the predominantly white <ORGANIZATION> Pekin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> twice in the 1988-89 school year.

<HEAD>Administration Still Wants to End Farm Export Subsidies in Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is proceeding with proposals to liberalize world agricultural trade, including a five-year phasing out of export subsidies, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday. Eventually, perhaps within a decade, the plan also calls for the elimination of domestic programs that distort international trade in farm commodities. But Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the detailed plan, which will be presented formally Wednesday in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, would not get rid of all government farm aid. `` There is nothing here that precludes any nation from having a safety net for its farmers,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural policy `` will not be made in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> or some foreign capital It will be made by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which must approve any final <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> agreement before it can become law in this country.'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> added in a statement, `` I will not abandon our farmers to unfair competition. I will also not allow the administration to abandon them either.'' The current round of talks under the 97-nation <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> began in <LOCATION> Punta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Esta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, on Sept. 20, 1986, and will conclude at the end of 1990. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who joined <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> at a news conference, said the plan now going before <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is not much different from the initial <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal made in 1987, although it is `` much more comprehensive, much more specific'' than the earlier plan. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said the agriculture proposal `` would mean that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s farmers could compete against foreign farmers based on price and quality, rather than on the depth of a foreign government's pocketbook'' or the height of a trade The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objective in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> talks has been to gain improved market access for American goods and services, including major farm commodities such as grain, oilseeds, cotton and livestock products. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal calls for gradually scaling down or eliminating quotas and other non-tariff barriers by converting them into tariffs over 10 years. He said safeguards would be allowed for temporary protection against countries dumping their goods _ selling them below production cost Export subsidies would be phased out over five years, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. The export subsidies maintained by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> have been a sore point with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade officials for years Under the proposal, some domestic subsidies would have a `` red light'' designation and be eliminated gradually, those with a `` yellow light'' designation would be watched for possible further negotiation, and those with `` green light'' designation, such as conservation programs, would proceed. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> stressed that no move would be made unilaterally by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that no farm program would be altered unless other countries did likewise. `` If we travel down this correct road, we will travel it only in conjunction with our trading partners,'' he said. `` Whether or not we do so is now up to them.'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he doubted if the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> proposal would significantly alter the debate in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on new farm legislation due next year. He said he hoped that the 1990 farm legislation will become law before the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of trade talks conclude. Assuming the trade negotiations are successful, he said, `` We will make modifications in that -LRB- farm -RRB- legislation in 1991.'' <PERSON> Leland </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said his organization has `` some real concerns'' about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal, particularly in the interpretation of `` trade-distorting'' subsidies. `` We see encompassed within there a call to eliminate domestic farm programs and farm policy,'' <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. But <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> added that the union has supported the strengthening of trade rules in regard to direct export subsidies and that these could be reduced or eliminated so long as other countries did likewise. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> holds an advantage by being first in line at <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> with its proposals. `` We're going to again set the tone for this,'' he said. `` So ours will be the one that's under discussion.'' <PERSON> Kleckner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> `` believes that the thrust of this proposal is correct.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s first lady, <PERSON> Danielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, on Tuesday brought an impassioned appeal to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to help save the Kurdish people from annihilation. `` Do not forget them. Silence is killing them,'' she told the gongressional <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>. `` They are all individuals in distress and their people is in danger of extinction,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said. Several Kurdish women in the packed hearing room wept during her speech. There are an estimated 20 million Kurds scattered among <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. They have been subjected to persecution in all these countries, especially in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> which is strongly believed to have bombarded them with poison gas last year. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has denied the accusation, but one of three <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> physicians who visited Kurdish refugees from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in Turkish camps told the caucus his team found conclusive evidence of poison gas symptoms. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook-Deegan </PERSON> said refugees described eye, lung and gastro-intestinal irritation, consistent with the known effects of poison gas. Mrs. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, a noted human rights activist who co-sponsored the first international forum on the plight of the Kurds last week in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, described her visit last May to the same Turkish camps the physicians visited. Without directly criticizing <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which is one of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s biggest weapons clients, Mrs. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said the Kurdish refugees clearly do not believe assurances by the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government that they can return home without fear of persecution `` The result is that the Iraqi Kurds in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> are in a desperate situation: They can neither go home _ which is their deepest wish _ nor become integrated into the Kurdish population in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said she visited the camps, despite attempts by Turkish authorities to dissuade her, and encountered `` dreadful'' living conditions at the barbed-wire enclosures where more than 30,000 Kurdish refugees are incarcerated. The only help can come from the world's democratic governments, she said. Members of the caucus said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had ignored the Kurdish tragedy for too long. `` This is one of the most flagrant examples of man's inhumanity to man,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. `` The brutal <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> campaign to eradicate the Kurds must be condemned,'' he said. More than 60,000 Kurds fled the Iraqi attacks `` and we must act now to ensure it never, never happens again.''

<TEXT>
 Democratic mayoral candidate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' commanding lead in the polls over Republican <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has shrunk in the aftermath of questions about his financial dealings, a new poll indicates <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, who led <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> less than two weeks ago by about 20 percent, was picked by 45 percent compared with 41 percent for <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in the poll conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>. The poll of 500 voters, conducted Sunday, had a margin of error of 5 percentage points. The poll was the first since the Sept. 12 Democratic primary to show <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' support at less than 50 percent. The Daily News-WABC poll indicated the biggest shift in support occurred among Jewish voters, who last week favored <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> by 10 points. Now, 44 percent of Jewish voters support <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> and 26 percent support <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, according to the poll. Twenty-six percent were undecided, and 69 percent were not strongly committed to either candidate. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> on Monday compared the new poll results to those done shortly before the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary `` that suggested that -LRB- Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> and I were neck and neck. We of course were not and the outcome was not what they predicted. `` I suspect that's the case here,'' he said. However, <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said he had `` anticipated there would be some fall-off'' in support among all voters due to the recent controversy over his finances. Political analysts have said <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' loss of support may be due to questions about his finances, including his failure to pay taxes from 1969 to 1973 and discrepancies in the stated value of stock he transferred to his son. <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said the poll results confirm `` what I've been seeing in the streets in the last three or four weeks.'' He said voters `` want fundamental change. They want honest, reformed government. I think they realize ... that <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> is n't up to the task of being mayor.''

 Some 300 men, most of them permanently homeless, had plenty of food and a warm place to sleep Tuesday aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship called into earthquake duty. `` We're eating just fine,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clulow </PERSON>, among those aboard the helicopter carrier <PERSON> Peleliu </PERSON>, docked on the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embarcadero </LOCATION>, just south of the of the crippled <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. `` We're getting steaks, roast beef, ham end eggs, vegetables and snacks all day _ and regular showers _ the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s doin' a good job,'' declared <PERSON> Clulow </PERSON> on the carrier's cavernous hangar deck. It was crowded with refugees, cots, food tables, assorted officials from all levels, and social workers. `` We're feeding them 900 meals a day _ <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chow,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON>. The ship, whose usual mission is to deploy assault landing forces by helicopter, landing craft and amphibious vehicles, arrived in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> from exercises in the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The men, brought to the carrier Sunday night, had been staying at the Moscone Convention Center before they, along with 800 others, were bused to the ship or to Army Presidio barracks on the northwest edge of the city. The convention center had been used as an earthquake evacuation shelter but was emptied so it could be readied for a convention next week. Security was stiff as the men paraded aboard over the gangway, then halted for security searches. `` Yes, they were frisked before they came aboard,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloan </PERSON>. `` These were druggies, alcoholics. These were people from the street. Some of them took cocaine and stuff out of their pockets.'' Crew members were reported to have been uncomfortable in this task, as were the refugees. `` I'm sure some of them have AIDS,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Boocher </PERSON>, who was obviously unhappy about the refugees. Near the quarterdeck, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteer nurse <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> handed out warm clothing and toilet kits to a line of men. `` Some of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- people have been real stressed, but everybody has been very nice,'' said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Dillard </PERSON>. `` I'm not unhappy at all, like at first,'' said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been very nice to us. Everything's fine. Everything's beautiful.'' Up on the hangar deck, workers from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> filled in displaced person forms for later disaster aid. Men who could n't provide a `` pre-earthquake'' address, were referred to other emergency agencies, <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged Tuesday it may have erred in rewarding the private operators of several of its nuclear weapons plants with millions of dollars in bonuses despite serious failings to protect the health and safety of workers and nearby residents. The admission came from <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the deputy energy secretary, and other department officials during a grilling by a House Government Operations subcommittee, which documented the bonus payments to operators of the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant and the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear production center. <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the nation's only source of tritium used to make nuclear warheads, has been closed for more than a year because of safety and technical problems that prompted the department to switch management companies there last April. The Rocky Flats plant, situated about 16 miles from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, is in disarray and is under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation for possible criminal violation of environmental laws. `` There is room for real question'' about whether the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should have paid $ 912,000 in bonuses last year to the top 25 E.I. du <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> managers of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> plant near <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said in sworn testimony. He acknowledged that the three highest-paid <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> executives, with collective government salaries of $ 561,000 and bonuses of $ 306,000 in 1988, were not based at the plant site. They worked at <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> headquarters at <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, Del. Separately, government auditors disclosed Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 27, 1988, told the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that some of the reactor fuel and `` targets'' used to produce tritium at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> were defective and that others might be defective as well. The department immediately ordered <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> to stop making the fuel and targets and to investigate whether the problem might jeoparidize safety. Several months later it was decided there was no safety problem, but the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> did not approve a plan for improving manufacturing of the fuel and targets until earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said in a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Replacing the defective and suspect materials will cost at least $ 731,000 and possibly an additional $ 8 million, depending on how the problem is resolved, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. Over the objections of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s legal staff, Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee, released figures on salaries and bonuses paid to <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> executives in each of the past five years In what <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> called a compromise with the department, the subcommittee withheld the names and job titles of the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> managers. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said that to release the managers' names would unfairly subject them to `` public abuse.'' From 1984 through 1988, the top 25 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> executives in charge of running <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> got $ 12.7 million in salaries plus $ 3.5 million in performance bonuses from the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the figures showed. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savannah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> took over as operator at the plant last April 1. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told the committee that the top <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> executives are paid less than the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> managers were, and that all top <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> managers are stationed at the plant. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> did not provide exact figures for Westhinghouse salaries or bonuses. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> also questioned why the department paid <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> $ 26.8 million in bonus money in the 1986-88 fiscal years for running <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> in a period when the plant was cited for numerous flaws in safety and health protection. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, in a separate report released at the subcommitee hearing, said the department, in its ratings used to set <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s semi-annual bonus awards, deliberately played down or ignored negative information about the company's performance <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Twining </PERSON>, who headed the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, that approved the bonus payments to <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>, admitted under questioning from <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> that the department probably went too easy on <LOCATION> Rockwell </LOCATION>. `` Looking back from today, those ratings could clearly be questioned,'' <PERSON> Twining </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> announced last month that it was withdrawing from its Rocky Flats contract next January because of a disagreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> over the company's potential liability for environmental violations at the plant. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> disclosed that <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which will take over as operator of <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> leaves, will be paid $ 15 million in advance for one year's work. After the first year, its earnings will be pegged to performance ratings by the department, he said.

<HEAD>Chief: Fire Efforts Much Improved Over 1906</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 While fires caused the major devastation from the 1906 earthquake, lessons learned then helped the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reduce losses from last week's temblor, Fire Chief <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said Tuesday. Firefighters strapped for equipment also pulled two trucks out of a city museum and pressed them into service, and a controversial and expensive fire boat maintained by the city proved its value, <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> told members of the city <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in a preliminary report. But perhaps the most important development was the creation years ago of a special water main system that allowed broken areas to be quickly sealed off and the water diverted. With no water available in 1906, firefighters watched helplessly as flames consumed thousands of buildings. Only a handful were destroyed by fire in last week's quake, fire officials said. `` In 1906 there was no water for four days,'' <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said. `` We did n't have water for 1 -LCB- to 2 hours.'' `` That's a credit to our forefathers from the last quake,'' <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said there were just 14 breaks in water mains caused by the Oct. 17 quake. The 1906 quake caused 300 breaks. But the breaks were critical in the hard-hit <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where fires broke out and there was no water to fight them. `` It was rolling,'' said firefighter <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON>. `` It was going to take off on the whole area.'' Firefighters ran a hose into a pond at the nearby Palace of Fine Arts, and also pumped out of the bay with the fire boat <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, to douse the flames, <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said. `` That was what in the fire service is called a miraculous stop,'' <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said. The fire boat had recently been the target of city budget cuts, but was saved at the last minute. In the first hours after the quake, firefighters responded to 400 calls for assistance, including 27 fires, <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said. On an average day there are 159 calls for help. A total of 2,000 calls for help were received in the first 80 hours, 300 percent above normal, he said. `` Ninety percent of the calls the first day were gas leaks,'' he said, while others were to rescue people trapped in buildings and elevators and inspect buildings. With so much demand, equipment ran short and ingenious firefighters took equipment out of the city's fire museum, <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said. One engine was a 1961 model that was the only jet turbine water pumper ever built, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stacks </PERSON>, a museum trustee. The jet turbine, built by planemaker The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was not a successful experiment and had been removed from the truck, she said. But because it was the only one ever built, the truck was placed in the museum. <PERSON> Mielke </PERSON> said the old truck was used to answer about 15 calls in his area while regular engines raced to the <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district. Firefighters refitted the old truck with pumping equipment. `` It was missing fittings and certain things like that but it worked fine,'' he said. Also used was a 1937 foam truck that is normally only taken out in parades, Ms. Stacks said. The truck was used to transport firefighters, she said. <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said 400 off-duty firefighters rushed back to work in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, while others were unable to reach the city because of traffic congestion and ruined roads. There has been criticism of the department's reduced manpower and defective equipment. Only about 1,325 of 1,500 authorized firefighting poisitions are filled, <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said, and the department suffers from a shortage of high-rise firefighting equipment and reserve equipment. But <PERSON> Postel </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the department's performance He could not estimate how many firefighters responded in total.

 The Who, <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Darin </PERSON>, the Four Tops and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> were among eight recording artists selected Tuesday to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. They will be inducted in January in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> along with The Four Seasons, The Kinks, The Platters and <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> in the class of 1990. Their selections bring to 43 the number of recording acts chosen for the hall of fame. In addition to the recording artists, three `` early influencers'' were selected to be honored at the as-yet unbuilt hall of fame and museum _ jazz singer-trumpeter <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, jazz guitarist <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and blues pioneer <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainey </PERSON>. This year's selection of inductees was announced at a news conference by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON>, band leader on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Late Night with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'' and musical director of the rock hall induction ceremony the past three years. `` This is a big year for me, personally. It's starting to move into my era,'' <PERSON> Shaffer </PERSON> quipped. `` The first album I ever bought was a Four Seasons Golden Hits. I still have that record I bought.'' `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Darin </PERSON> was an idol of mine. I love the Four Tops. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>. ... I'm thrilled with this year's inductees,'' he said Rock music historian <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nite </PERSON>, who has two syndicated radio rock' n' roll oldies shows, called the latest group of selections `` a good cross section'' of musical style. <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION>, a member of the rock hall board, said the class represents an effort to honor entertainers who are long overdue for recognition. `` We're trying to get caught up on a lot of people owed getting in. As years go by, it will get tighter and tighter,'' <ORGANIZATION> Nite </ORGANIZATION> said. Two songwriting teams will be inducted in the non-performing music industry category, although some have been important performers as well. The writers include the teams of <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lamont </PERSON> <PERSON> Dozier </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goffin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. Groundbreaking for the $ 48 million hall of fame and museum is set for next year in downtown <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> next to the <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who is heading a fund-raising effort in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, said he hopes to reach an interim goal of $ 40 million by Nov. 15. The hall of fame and museum is to open in 1992. More than 200 performers, producers, writers, record executives and broadcasters cast ballots this year. Inducted earlier this year were <PERSON> Dion </PERSON>, <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, The Rolling Stones, The Temptations and <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Math, Science Teachers Lobby for Money</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some of the nation's top math and science teachers listened to a pep talk from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Tuesday and then lobbied on Capitol Hill for more money for training and classroom equipment. `` As you know, science and math teachers are endangered species,'' <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION>, Research and Technology. Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, who teaches at <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's 13th largest inner city school, was one of 112 teachers who received the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching. She and a few others testified before a special session of the subcommittee, which gathered information on innovative ways to teach science and mathematics. The teachers' focus seemed to be more on money, however. Ms. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must consider increasing federal funds for teacher training and equipment, and for special grants to those teachers willing to work in rural and center city schools. She also asked that the federal government subsidize summer jobs for many of the underpaid science and math teachers, as well as memberships in various science programs. <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> of <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Eutaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, asked that increased federal aid be targeted for mathematics and science specialists to teach and lead research projects in kindergarten through the third grade. `` Once we lose them in elementary school, they are gone,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. During ceremonies in the White House Rose Garden under a brilliant autumn sun, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the teachers they have demonstrated not only that excellence is possible in American education but that it should `` be the norm.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> lamented that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools do not produce more top performers in these subjects. `` You've seen all the surveys about <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> students' poor performance in scientific knowledge compared to their peers around the world. We've all seen it. We agonize over them,'' he said. `` You're not just complaining about it, you are doing something about it. You're showing that excellence is not just possible in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> education, but that it ought to be the norm,'' the president said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has bought 5,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surplus butter at cut-rate prices. F. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON>, general sales manager of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the salted butter was sold to Fromageries Dischamp of <LOCATION> Sayat </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, a privately owned dairy products firm The contract calls for an option buy an additional 10,000 tons of butter, subject to agreement by both parties. <PERSON> Dickerson </PERSON> said the butter was sold for use in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> or other <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> countries. The butter was sold for $ 1,620 per ton delivered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports, an average of less than 74 cents per pound. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. According to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the surplus butter cost about $ 1.40 per pound to acquire under the government's dairy price support program. The 1985 farm law, as amended by the Hunger Relief Act of 1988, requires the export sale of 150,000 tons of surplus dairy products each fiscal year through September 30, 1990. Products sold under the program generally are at going world prices.

<HEAD>Report Clothing and Dentral Charts to Help Identify Crash Victims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Reports of the clothing and dental charts of people killed in the crash of a Honduran airliner were read on radio broadcasts Tuesday in an effort to help identify the charred remains of many victims. A <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 of the TAN-SAHSA airline crashed into a mountain as it approached the <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> airport Saturday and 131 of the 146 people aboard were killed. Morgue officials said Tuesday the bodies of 97 victims have been identified. The grim effort to identify the others continued. `` Body number five, female, wearing blue jeans, gold cap on the third pre-molar,'' said a broadcast from the morgue by Radio HRN. `` Body number 10, male, 1.75 meters tall, green shirt, partial dentures in upper jaw,'' the report said. `` Body number 79, male, apparentlyfrom <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, blue pants, sweatshirt with the letter B. The body has no head.'' Hundreds of people fearing relatives or friends perished in crash have gone to the morgue and some have been able to assist in the identifications. `` The easy ones are identified first. It's a slow process,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneebone </PERSON>. He said 12 Americans are presumed dead, but he could not say which bodies had been identified because of privacy act considerations. Three Americans, the pilot, co-pilot and two flight attendants were among the 15 survivors. The pilot was severely injured and investigators have been unable to question him. Co-pilot <PERSON> Reiniero </PERSON> <PERSON> Canales </PERSON> said in a radio interview Monday that the flight was normal unril `` suddenly we hit something. It was all so fast we did n't have time to react.'' The jetliner was 1,800 feet below its assigned flight path when it crashed into a mountain, <LOCATION> Cerro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hule </LOCATION>, about 6 miles south of the <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> runway. Some investigators were considering air turbulence as the cause, with two theories. One focused on an atmospheric phenomenon called a `` rolling wave'' that would create a violent downdraft and the other involved wind pressure created by a valley near the peak and a low pressure zone behind the peak. `` We have n't definitively ruled anything out yet,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON>, head of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> team assisting the Honduran government. Bodies of 23 of the 67 Nicaraguan victims were flown Tuesday to <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and about 500 relatives and friends of the victims were at the airport. The transfer had been planned for Monday but was delayed because of preparation of the bodies and a shortage of metal caskets in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Abud </PERSON>, a Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry official in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said the problems `` could have been overcome if there were a little more willingness'' on the part of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. Relations between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> have been tense since <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in 1979, overthrowing conservative President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Honduran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> had called him to offer condolences and apologize for the difficulties.

<HEAD>Pentagon Extends Design Work On ATF Fighter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon announced on Tuesday it granted a six-month extension for early design work on the Advanced Tactical Fighter, a program that has come under fire from <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers. While Pentagon and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were unable to determine an exact cost for the delay, one report put it between $ 250 million and $ 500 million. The fighter, informally known as the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION>, is slated to be the next-generation aircraft that will succeed the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s F-15 and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s F-14D Tomcat fighter. Two design teams are competing to build the aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> are building a prototype design known as YF-23 while <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> are constructing a prototype known as the YF-22. Congressional sources, who spoke on condition of not being identified by name, said the delay was sought because the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> team was not as far along as the Northrop-led group. The source said the delay also `` gives the acquisition people in <ORGANIZATION> DOD </ORGANIZATION> more time,'' to obtain more detailed test data and to decide which version of the plane they want. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Betti </PERSON>, the undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> for acquisition, informed the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last Wednesday that a six-month extension had been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s top procurment panel, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a brief statement. The extension has been granted for the phase formally known as the demonstration-validation phase. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, Capt. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Crumm </PERSON>, said the delay is designed to `` reduce the technical risk and cost uncertainties of the program.'' A report in <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, which cited unnamed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and industry sources, said the cost of the anticipated contract changes ranged from $ 250 million to $ 500 million. The report said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials expect to take the money from funds earmarked for the plane's full-scale development phase. <PERSON> Crumm </PERSON> said she could not comment on the report. With the additional six-month delay, full-scale development of the plane is not expected to begin before mid-1991. The lastest change follows a decision in January to lengthen the full-scale development time for the plane from 23 months to 36 months. That is the time from when the contract is awarded until the first flight of the plane is anticipated. In September, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> noted that the cost of research and development of the <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> program has increased by $ 900 million, to $ 13.5 billion, over the past six months. The problems prompted the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in its appropriations bill, to eliminate the $ 1.1 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s fighter and $ 65 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s version in the fiscal 1990 budget. The action by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> was considered a proverbial shot across the bow, with members saying they expected the funding to be restored once the final defense appropriations bill was passed.

<HEAD>Former Labor Secretary Tapped to Mediate Coal Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Labor Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> has been picked to mediate the six-month dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, sources said Tuesday. Current Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is to formally announce her choice Wednesday, but aides declined comment Tuesday on whom it might be. Two sources familiar with the decision, speaking on the condition they not be identified, said that <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, who in the past quarter century has helped settle dozens of bitter strikes, was <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s choice as `` supermediator'' for the coal strike, which began April 5 and has idled 1,700 miners in three states. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> visited a <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> facility in <LOCATION> Carbo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, earlier this month and days later met with <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> After that session she announced plans to name an outside mediator. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, who was labor secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administration, since leaving government has headed a labor relations consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He was out of town Tuesday but was scheduled to return Tuesday night, his secretary said. There have been some talks involving the union and <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>, but only with federal mediators shuttling messages back and forth to the separate rooms of union and company negotiators. The major issue in the strike, which affects <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> mines in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, is health and retirement benefits. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> withdrew last year from the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the national bargaining arm of most coal companies, because it said the group had given the miners too much medical coverage in its contract, particularly for pensioners. As labor secretary, <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> sometimes stepped into contract disputes but Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has resisted such tactics in favor of outside mediators. `` I am not a mediator,'' she said during her visit to the Pittston facility. `` I'm not here to say I have the answer to this complex problem. But I do feel now it is time to see if we can facilitate the bargaining process.'' In selecting <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> turned to a man with an impressive and lengthy resume as a mediator. In 1987 he was credited with forging a settlement to a six-month strike by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> against the <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Four years earlier, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> called <PERSON> Usery </PERSON> a genius after he brought an end to a three-week strike by the city's teachers, their longest ever, in just 24 He also helped settle a professional football strike in 1974 and has mediated dozens of other disputes in the rubber, auto, electric, hotel, transportation and other industries. <PERSON> Usery </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Hardwick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, was brought to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1969 by then-President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and named assistant secretary of labor. He quickly was credited with helping settle railroad and airline labor disputes. In 1973 he was named director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conciliation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and served in that post for three years until <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> tapped him to head the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.

<DATELINE>SULTANPUR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on Tuesday flew by helicopter to the country's most densely populated voter belt and filed the papers that formally launch his quest for re-election. The 45-year-old <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who pledged to uphold the constitution after paying a $ 30 election filing fee, was then driven through <LOCATION> Sultanpur </LOCATION>, a town of 100,000 in the northern state of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>. He was greeted by about 2,000 spectators. Political analysts say next month's parliamentary election could be the closest in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 42 years of independence. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, appearing in public for the first time since new elections were announced a week ago, professed confidence his party would return to power in the balloting for the lower house of parliament set for Nov. 22, 24 and 26. `` The people are going to help us win the election,'' said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, who was filing in the <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION> constituency that he has represented since 1981. So far, there has been no indication of who the opposition will chose to oppose <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in this constituency. There has been speculation the prime minister might face <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a former ally now leading the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> opposition coalition. `` I would welcome this,'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> told reporters, `` but he would lose.'' A month ago, a unified opposition seemed possible as <ORGANIZATION> Hindu </ORGANIZATION> activists joined communists in anti-government protests. But recent outbreaks of Hindu-Moslem violence around <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> have led the communists and some centrists to question the viability of a broad opposition alliance. At least 79 people have died in Hindu-Moslem clashes since August, including 23 last month in <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION>. The prospects of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party are uncertain. The prime minister has been haunted for more than two years by charges of high level corruption in his government. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, often perceived as wishy-washy in his efforts to unite opposition parties, is campaigning as `` Mr. Clean,'' just as <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> himself did five years ago. The 58-year-old <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who once served as defense and finance ministers in <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION>'s Cabinet, has seized on Indian newspaper reports that Swedish arms manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid up to $ 50 million in kickbacks to secure a 1986 contract to deliver $ 1.4 billion worth of artillery guns to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> has repeatedly denied the reports. Waiting for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on Tuesday, a score of men chanted that they would vote for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Bahadur </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a university student, interrupted the chorus. `` We are free to cast our vote _ not necessarily for <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>,'' he said. Other spectators said they would vote for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. `` We like V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> because he is an honest person,'' said 20-year-old <PERSON> Girish </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, another spectator. With more than 79 million eligible voters, <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> controls 85 seats in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, the lower policy-making house of parliament, more than any of the other 24 states. This year, under a constitutional amendment initiated by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, 18 - to 20-year-olds can vote in the national election for the first time They comprise 7 percent of the electorate of 500 million. Indians will vote in 542 constituencies.

<TEXT>
 Private insurance and health care should be opened up to more people through a system of legal requirements and increased taxes, state and congressional officials said Tuesday. `` Although we may not be able to provide universal health care in our country at this time, we ought to provide universal access to health insurance in the private sector,'' said Rep <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging proposed a `` rearrangement of present plans ... to place the burdens on all Americans'' in his testimony at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Bipartisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION>. `` We must be able to expand the cigarette tax,'' <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON> said, explaining that surveys show Americans are willing to pay increased taxes to solve pressing national and ethical problems such as health care. <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energey </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on health and environment complained that health insurers want to provide coverage only to the healthy leaving 20 percent of all applicants for private insurance without adequate coverage because of exclusions or above-average premiums for pre-existing medical conditions. He has introduced legislation to prohibit private insurers from denying coverage in such situations. Expansion of the payroll tax, increased estate and gift taxes and universal mandatory health insurance are solutions to the nation's health care crisis, said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Matula </PERSON>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>'s Medicaid director `` We are mandated to have car insurance and fire insurance. We can be mandated to pay health insurance,'' said <PERSON> Matula </PERSON>, who represented the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> at Tuesday's hearing Business representatives argued mandated benefits would increase costs and threaten the viability of small businesses that employ most new American workers. But <PERSON> Matula </PERSON> insisted workers and employers not be allowed to opt out of paying health insurance premiums because they would provide funding for coverage for themselves, their families and the unemployed. While not offering specific strategies or solutions, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glasser </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, a 20-year-old coalition of about 40 individuals and labor leaders pleaded with the commission not to `` try again to resort to piecemeal, patchwork methods'' like the catastrophic health care program. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> repealed the program outright and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> drastically cut its funding. The differences among lawmakers are being worked out by a budget conference committee. The 15-member panel, known as the <ORGANIZATION> Pepper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for the late <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> congressman who was its first chairman and creator, was born in the catastrophic care law. It is to submit to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a proposal for health care reforms entailing what benefits to provide to whom and how to pay for them. There are an estimated 31 million people who have no health insurance, more than 9 million Americans who need long-term care and 13.5 million underinsured who can not get adequate health care because of financial constraints. The commission is scheduled to hold at least one additional hearing before making its final report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> by March 1, 1990.

 Acting just a week after the nation's most costly natural disaster, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday voted to speed $ 2.85 billion in earthquake-relief aid to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. State lawmakers said more money would be needed later to finish the job. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the appropriation by a vote of 321-99. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to concur Wednesday and send the legislation to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, whose spokesman indicated he would sign the bill. `` We were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive power of World War II, including the atomic bomb,'' Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, D-Calif., told her colleagues before the vote `` Please give us a chance to rebuild,'' said <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s heavily damaged <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Fazio </PERSON>, D-Calif., leading his state's efforts to garner federal assistance, said that with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote, `` We're off to a good start. But he noted that the $ 2.85 billion was less than the state's delegation had sought and said efforts would be made to increase the relief fund when the bill reaches the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> _ or in future legislation <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s two senators, working with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s leaders, hoped to pave the way for more assistance when their chamber debates the measure Wednesday. Sens. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, a Democrat, and <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a Republican, said they would seek authority for an additional $ 600 million for small business aid. That money would need subsequent legislation to be appropriated. The senators said they would also seek several amendments easing federal restrictions, such as one making the damaged <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> ineligible for federal aid because it is a toll facility. Still, the $ 2.85 billion package would be the largest single congressional disaster-relief appropriation ever, dwarfing the $ 1.1 billion approved just last month for the victims of Hurricane Hugo. The $ 2.85 billion is a compromise between the $ 3.8 billion <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> representatives had sought and the $ 2.5 billion the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had proposed. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration supported the compromise because it was `` pretty close to ours.'' Here is how the $ 2.85 billion would be allocated: _ $ 1.1 billion would go to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to aid victims and local governments get back on their feet. _ $ 1 billion would go for bridge and highway repairs. _ $ 500 million would go to aid small businesses. _ $ 250 million would be set aside in for kitty for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to spend for the victims as he sees fit. Damage estimates from the earthquake have topped $ 7 billion. A 50-foot section of the Bay Bridge toppled and must be replaced; double-deck highways on both sides of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bay sustained severe damage; up to 1,000 homes in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> alone are said to need extensive repairs. At least 63 people died. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> estimated damage from the quake at $ 7.1 billion. Damage from <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> had been estimated at $ 4 billion to $ 5 billion and from the 1906 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> quake _ the previous record _ at $ 5.8 billion after adjustments for inflation. Money allocated to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> will provide for temporary housing, home repairs, unemployment payments, grants to families and assistance for local governments. There was no dispute over the need for the emergency allocation among lawmakers, who considered the proposal with unusual speed. Much debate focused on whether the spending in the legislation _ and in the earlier measure to aid victims of Hugo _ should be included in the government's calculations of the federal deficit. On a 401-18 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> decided it should. The shortfall for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, has previously been projected by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to be $ 141 billion. The $ 2.85 billion was approved as part of an emergency spending bill needed to keep the government functioning until Nov. 15. The legal authority that most agencies have to spend money expires at midnight Wednesday. The special legislation is needed because only two of the 13 annual appropriations bills for fiscal 1990, which began Oct. 1, have been signed into law.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s defense minister said Tuesday the <ORGANIZATION> Kremlin </ORGANIZATION> admission that one of its radars violates the 1972 ABM treaty was a `` remarkable'' example of the change taking place in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said the speech Monday by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> containing the statement was `` a true sign of glasnost,'' the policy of openness promoted by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> and the other <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers are in this resort for a semiannual meeting of the Western alliance's Nuclear Planning Group. `` The fact that he stands up and says straight out that <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> was a violation of the anti-ballistic missile treaty is a whole new language,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> told reporters after the Tuesday afternoon session. He said there had been no time for a full analysis of the changes under way in the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Frits </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolkestein </PERSON>, the Dutch defense minister, said the final statement Wednesday was expected to welcome <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s pledge that the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> would be dismantled. `` It was an acknowledgement of what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has maintained for a long time ... and we obviously applaud this recognition,'' said a senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who demanded anonymity. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, speaking to the Soviet legislature, said the <LOCATION> Krasnoyarsk </LOCATION> radar had been a stumbling block to agreement with the West on other arms issues. `` We are saving the ABM treaty and opening the way to the conclusion of a treaty on strategic weapons,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. He also said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was prepared to withdraw all military forces to its own territory by the year 2000 and negotiate elimination of the opposing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliances. The <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers, meeting for two days at the Quinta do Lago vacation complex on <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s southern Algarve coast, rejected the latter idea. `` I can assure you, we're not thinking of disbanding <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said, and called <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s offer `` an old formula ... more vague and abstract'' than before. <PERSON> Bolkestein </PERSON> said: `` There's not much left of the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in terms of true cohesion. The same thing can not be said of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have are moving away from one-party <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rule and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has made no move to stop them, but they have sworn continued allegiance to the Eastern defense alliance. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said ministers agreed Tuesday that the future role of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nuclear forces would be studied after the signing of a conventional arms reduction treaty, expected at the end of talks now being conducted in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. He said he expected preliminary drafts of six papers for the study to be ready next year and anticipated `` concrete proposals'' by 1991. During the morning session, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Soviet spending on strategic and space weapons had not slowed under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program of reform, officials reported. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aides estimated the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> spends $ 20 billion to $ 40 billion a year on its space program, Dutch officials said. All 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations attend the nuclear strategy sessions except <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, which is not a member of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s integrated military structure. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, which has no armed forces, attends as an observer.

 As a governor's panel prepares to probe the deadly earthquake-collapse of Interstate 880, outsiders are hurling their theories at state officials inundated by `` Monday morning quarterbacks.'' <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have declined to speculate on the collapse and are refusing to share information they might have about why a 1 \ - mile section of freeway in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> fell down in the Thirty-nine bodies have been recovered from the rubble of I-880 _ making up more than half the 63 quake casualties. More are expected from the collapse as rescuers carefully search the unstable rubble. Outside engineers and structural experts, whose views are being sought largely by the news media, are blaming everything from a lack of steel in the vertical columns to unstable soil beneath the structure and the peculiar way the structure may have synchronized with earthquake waves. Few have visited the wreckage and must draw their conclusions from news accounts and pictures. <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> `` is still not letting anybody in but their own people to take a look,'' complained scientist <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Borchardt </PERSON>, an expert on soil stability with the state Division of Mines and Geology. `` We're not going to get into that,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> structural chief <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> when asked again if the department has ideas about the cause of the collapse. The department maintains that it was as surprised as Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> that the structure fell down, and spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Drago </PERSON> said the agency is tired of all the `` Monday morning quarterbacks.'' `` I've been assured there were no experts, no studies, no data that suggested in any way that it would fall,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON>. But in the quake's wake, experts are offering their theories, and old studies and documents are beginning to surface. Generally, experts and <ORGANIZATION> Caltrans </ORGANIZATION> agree on a general observation: the structure, opened in July 1957, was built with out-of-date earthquake safety codes, and the materials used, such as concrete, are not as strong as material available today. Beyond that, the theories are varied. Among them: _ An engineer hired by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Piotr </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moncarz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION>, who was able to visit the site, suggested that the freeway was brought down partly because seismic waves coincided with the swinging of the structure, amplifying the quake's power _ Soils expert <PERSON> Borchardt </PERSON>, who first raised the soil instability issue in a 1982 report on earthquake dangers, said the ground beneath the structure, made up largely of clay, may have `` liquefied'' or at least `` amplified'' the quake's effect _ Former state highway engineer <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> See </PERSON> said the freeway fell because reinforcing bar in the concrete pillars was not braced or wrapped with more steel _ Dr <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Priestly </PERSON>, a structural expert at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said lack of steel in the columns contributed to their collapse, but added that steel connections holding the roadway to the columns also were suspect. _ <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kariotis </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> structural engineer, said the columns could have been strengthened with steel jackets to avoid collapse, an argument rejected by <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who said their own experiments showed that would n't have worked In the end, <PERSON> Drago </PERSON> said, all the theories might turn out to be correct, but they're little help now because `` You never get two engineers to agree on anything.''

 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> disbanded six tank regiments Tuesday as part of unilateral disarmament plans the communist nation announced earlier this year.

It said 600 T-54 and T-55 tanks would either be destroyed or converted for civilian use. It did not say what the civilian uses would be or how many tanks were deactivated Tuesday. ADN also did not report how many soldiers were involved, but said 400 were in one of the regiments. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> announced in January it would reduce its armed forces by 10,000 soldiers, 600 tanks and 50 fighter aircraft. Some tanks were dismantling last summer and several hundred soldiers were transferred to reserve units, the agency reported. Col.

<HEAD>Panel Proposes Creating Arctic Demilitarized Zone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> should help create a demilitarized zone in the Arctic, a panel recommended Tuesday at a conference on cooperation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The proposal came as part of arms-control discussions for the region by the 13-member panel that included disarmament experts, retired <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> military officers and native Indian representatives. The recommendations, including an end to simulated bombings over the region, came on the second day of a four-day conference on Canadian-Soviet Arctic cooperation. In its recommendations, the panel said the Arctic should be made into a demilitarized zone that prohibits military aircraft carrying nuclear weapons from flying in or out of the region. However, it said under its proposal that members of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact would be allowed to fly over the region to verify arms-control agreements. The panel also said the superpowers should agree to strict limits or a total ban on sea-launched cruise missiles from Arctic waters. The group further called for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to agree to keep its submarines out of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s Arctic waters and halt weapons tests at <ORGANIZATION> Novaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zemlya </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION>. At a conference dinner Monday, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s junior minister for Indian and northern affairs said negotiating Arctic security issues outside of East-West arms talks now under way could prove destabilizing. The minister, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, said the best way to ensure peace and security in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> `` is to lend full support to the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations on arms control.'' <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Granowsky </PERSON>, a Soviet Foreign Ministry official, said he could n't comment officially because the conference proposals did n't come from the Canadian government However, he said Soviets attending the conference had welcomed the ideas. `` We appreciate the fact that Canadian scholars are expressing new ideas to strengthen security in the region,'' he said. `` We need a stockpile of ideas for future dialogue. We ourselves are searching for new concepts.'' The conference was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, an independent <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> think-tank, and the Union of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Friendship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION>, a group that promotes multinational cooperation.

 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state lawmakers who spent Tuesday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said they were encouraged by meetings with administration officials and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote for an earthquake relief package, but the praise was less than unanimous. `` We think we have been very successful here as it relates to the administration,'' said State Senator <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, discussing meetings held with a variety of federal officials. `` Our congressional delegation has been successful.'' `` We're very happy with our input here,'' said <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, a Republican. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> said the group of six assembly members and four senators met with <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, acting <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>; the deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> and a member of the White House staff. He said that among the progress made was a `` commitment -LRB- by <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to look at the idea'' of sending in trailers to house the 8,000 to 10,000 people left homeless in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> areas south of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; a commitment from <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> to extend emergency housing grants to three months for renters and more than four months for homeowners if needed; a promise to expand the number of disaster application centers if necessary; and a move by <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> to free $ 500 million for earthquake aid. <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON> also said that the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> will get together with the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> to talk about raising the current cap on home repair loans by the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from $ 100,000 to $ 500,000. Lawmakers say raising the cap is necessary given the high cost of real estate in the area and it could be done with an administrative order if budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> would agree. The aid package passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> includes a requirement that the cap be raised. Californians have argued that the action would be too slow. State Assemblyman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, a Democrat who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was generally satisfied with the response from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but was concerned about the source of the $ 1 billion in bridge and road repair funds from Tuesday's House-passed legislation. `` The billion dollars that you heard talked about for transportation to some extent right now is a fiction,'' he said. `` It's a billion dollars that would have come to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> anyhow over the next several years, and under the current proposal we're getting it earlier. `` We will go back to the state today with better feelings than we came, more work that needs to be done,'' he said. `` We will go into special session next week and we will probably either generate some sales tax revenue or some additional revenue on our side to do part of the job from our standpoint. But again, we're going to need additional help from the White House.''

 The Arab League on Tuesday promised an accord for a complete Syrian troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> rejected a peace plan that lacks a timetable. Thousands of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> supporters demonstrated in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Tuesday and burned tires in the streets after Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> members of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> approved the plan in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, on Sunday. The peace plan, which is aimed at ending 14 years of Christian-Moslem fighting, gives more political power to the Moslem majority. It also says <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which backs Moslem leaders, must pull its troops out of the Lebanese capital within two years. But the forces, estimated at 40,000, could remain in the eastern <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> valley near the Syrian border, and the plan had no timetable for a total withdrawal. The Arab League said the duration of the Syrian forces' stay in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> `` will be defined by an accord between the Syrian and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> governments.'' The 22-member Arab League, it said, `` will be charged with concluding and implementing that accord.'' The commitment came in a document read by Saudi Foreign Minister Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> at the closing session of the Lebanese Parliament that was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The document called on the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to meet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> no later than Nov. 7 to ratify political reforms that were agreed upon in the peace plan and to elect a president for their fractured nation. The five-page document was signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee, comprising King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. The three leaders were asked by an Arab League summit meeting in May to try to help find a settlement to the sectarian turmoil in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. King Fahd, chairing the closing session in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>, told the 63 Parliamentarians present that the peace plan reached in the resort of Taif was a `` great achievement.'' He thanked Syrian President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for their cooperation, indicating he had won approval from the two enemies to stop arming rival factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> backs the Christians, and <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> is the Moslems' main supporter Fahd promised unspecified financial support to `` restore <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> better than it was'' once the peace plan is carried out. But as the final meeting got under way, 10,000 young followers of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> marched through the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to protest the accord. Addressing the demonstrators, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the reference in the peace accord to the timing of a Syrian withdrawal `` is very vague, from now until eternity.'' `` We do n't want to give away our beloved land,'' he said. The peace accord also would eventually lead to the disbanding of militias, and the main Shiite groups, the Syrian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, have rejected the accord. Druse warlord <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> also has criticized it. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Geagea </PERSON>, who commands the main Christian militia, the Lebanese Forces, still has not committed himself either way. Syrian forces came to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League Peacekeeping mandate and now control 70 percent of Lebanese territory. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> claims the Syrians have violated their mandate by siding with Moslems in the civil war, and his 20,000 troops fought the Syrians for six months until the Arab League-brokered cease-fire Sept. 22. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, has not openly criticized any of the political reforms suggested in the peace charter that are mainly designed to give Moslems an equal share of power with the Christians. These include increasing <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> seats from 99 to 108, to give Moslems equal representation in the legislature. The reforms also redistribute the powers of the president, traditionally a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, the prime minister, a Sunni Moslem, and the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, a Shiite Moslem, to ensure wider Moslem participation in the decision-making process. Christians have dominated power since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, when they were considered the majority. Moslems now make up 55 percent of the population of 4 million. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been without a head of state since <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired Sept. 22, 1988, with <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> unable to meet to elect a successor The vacuum produced two rival Cabinets, one <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, and a Syrian-backed government headed by <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni.

 The national <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> president said Tuesday he plans to go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in December to help three Estonian groups become chapters of the service organization. `` If we can get them going in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, we can get in the other Eastern bloc nations as well,'' said <PERSON> Robby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaycees </ORGANIZATION> president. <PERSON> Dawkins </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> to recognize the state's high national ranking in the organization.

 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sees rosier prospects in 12-18 months for his campaign to improve the economy and put more consumer goods on the shelves, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The official news agency said the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who has pressed for reform since gaining power in March 1985, spoke to journalists from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Pravda on Monday. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frolov </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> confidant, was named editor-in-chief of Pravda last week. Concern is widespread that people may go hungry this winter because of food shortages, which have caused rationing of meat, tea and other staples. Ethnic violence has contributed to shortages in some areas and has raised fears of mass unrest. Such problems have created disenchantment with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika'' reform program and some people even blame it for the nation's woes <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Pravda reporters `` the acuteness of the problems encountered by the country should be alleviated ... within 12-18 months,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said, paraphrasing his remarks and not giving reasons for such a precise forecast.

He said `` unpopular measures'' might be needed, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported without giving details.

<TEXT>
 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said Tuesday that tax increases to pay for last week's devastating earthquake would be a last resort he would turn to only if federal aid and the state surplus prove insufficient. `` I certainly have not ruled out the possibility of a tax increase,'' the governor said after a briefing with disaster officials in <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s `` salad bowl,'' where much of the state's lettuce, artichokes and berries are harvested. `` We are going to have to see whether or not there is going to be a need for additional revenues,'' said <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, speaking to reporters over the din of power saws, hammers and tractors in the central city. `` We are waiting to see what the federal government is going to do. They are moving very quickly,'' the governor said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday passed a $ 2.85 billion aid package and sent the measure to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The state surplus stands at $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> on Monday said a special session of the state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> would be called in the next two weeks to evaluate earthquake damage and arrange for relief that could include a temporary increase in sales or gasoline taxes. The Legislature completed its 1989 session Sept. 16 and is not due to return until January. The governor also said Monday that he and legislative leaders discussed the possibility of holding an earlier, special election to consider a ballot measure currently slated for June 1990. That proposal would liberalize the state's spending limit and pave the way for a gradual 9-cent gasoline tax increase. The governor flew to <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION> on Tuesday for a briefing on damages by city Fire Chief <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who said, `` Hopefully within the year we will be back on our feet and you wo n't even notice.'' As of Tuesday, the damage total was near a half-billion dollars in <LOCATION> Watsonville </LOCATION>, a community of 27,000 people. Regionwide, estimates topped $ 7 billion from the Oct. 17 quake. The city's Main Street was still cordoned off and thousands of people either displaced from their homes or too frightened to return indoors, congregated in makeshift tent cities. Outside <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, about 50 people lined up for tents, sleeping bags, clothing, food and household items. But outside the Main Street area, businesses were open. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> McQuillan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> fed breakfast to 5,357 people Tuesday. The city estimates 1,200 residents are out of their homes because of the quake, while <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crross </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> say up to 5,000 people are sleeping in tents. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> met privately with officials in City Hall, and later with <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in an open session. Spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> said it was unnecessary for the governor to get out of his car to see the damage or suffering. `` As you are driving into town, the damage is very evident,'' <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence committee said Tuesday that he and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have `` no philosophical difference'' about easing guidelines for involvement by <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operatives in coups in which a foreign leader might be killed. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>, said he wanted to clear up ambiguities in the guidelines within `` a matter of days or a few weeks as opposed to months.'' Saying that reports of disagreement with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were greatly exaggerated, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said, `` We're working in perfect harmony. We have not had a quarrelsome word about it. We have no philosophical difference.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had similar remarks about <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> the day before. The unsuccessful coup attempt against Panamanian Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> brought to light a series of classified guidelines that restrict the actions of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> officials under a longstanding prohibition against assassinations. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reportedly complained last week in a private meeting that an understanding reached between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> intelligence panel could, if narrowly interpreted, require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to warn <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of any coup that might endanger his life. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> confirmed that his committee and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration reached an understanding last year to restrict covert activities against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> because of the presidential elections in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The committee said, ` Let's wait _ we've got an election season _ to let the new president-elect have some input into it,''' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, speaking with reporters at the White House, endorsed the administation's call for a freer hand. `` I for one do n't believe that the prohibition against assassinations should keep you from working with someone that might want to overthrow a government,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` Those people would n't be aimed at hurting anyone or assassinating anyone,'' the senator said. `` They want to overthrow a government. You ca n't guarantee that someone might not get hurt in overthrowing a government. `` I certainly do n't believe there should be any affirmative obligation to inform someone like Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of any plan that we might learn about that might harm him in any way,'' he said. `` I think that goes far beyond what the executive order ever intended.'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> was among a group of senators that met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on his campaign for a cut in the capital gains tax rate. However, he was questioned by reporters later about the restrictions on <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents. `` The president and I have not had a feud about this,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` In fact we were just joking about it a minute ago. We do n't know where the feud came from.

<TEXT>
 The government, in an effort to quell violence by leftist guerrillas before municipal elections, on Tuesday placed <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and the nearby port of <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION> under state-of-emergency rule for 30 days. Rebels of the Maoist Shining Path movement have vowed to sabotage the elections set for Nov. 12. Guerrillas late Monday seized 10 buses in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION>, five miles west of the capital, and after ordering the occupants out burned the vehicles, according to police. No one was injured in the attacks. The state of emergency restricts civil rights, including the right of free movement and guarantees against search and seizure, and gives the military broad powers. <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Callao </LOCATION> have been under a state of emergency almost constantly since February 1986. The last decree affecting the two cities expired in July. The government on Tuesday also extended state-of-emergency restrictions in the Andean province of <LOCATION> Yauyos </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> department, the official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peruano </ORGANIZATION> reported. On Monday the government imposed emergency rule in four other provinces in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> department, giving the military control over most of the state. A department is the largest political subdivision in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and is divided into provinces. More than one third of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and about half of the country's 21 million people are now under emergency rule. The government has used state-of-emergency decrees to combat terrorism since 1982. The decrees are normally for periods ranging from 30 to 60 days and are routinely extended. Shining Path guerrillas began their compaign to gain power in 1980. The government has said more than 15,000 people have been killed in violence related to the insurgency.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, impatient with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' refusal to vote him line-item veto powers, is considering casting such a veto anyway `` to see if it works,'' spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Tuesday <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is seeking legislation on which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could exercise a partial veto _ and allow the courts to decide whether the president acted legally. `` We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test case, but at this point we do n't have one,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the civil and constitutional rights subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday that presidents do not have line-item veto authority under the Constitution `` That is an idea that many of us would resist very diligently,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It would give the president enormous new legislative powers that our founding fathers did n't have in mind for the president.'' He said that were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to try to cast such a veto, `` a majority of the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'' would promptly take him to court. Such a move _ vetoing just one part of a bill while leaving the rest intact _ would be certain to provoke a major constitutional confrontation with the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> majority in both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> conceded. `` We've got a lot of issues that probably would n't sit well with the Democratic leadership. But there is a larger question here,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He said that he assumed that such a veto would be challenged immediately in court. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> before him, proposed a constitutional amendment to spell out a right to vetosingle items in spending bills. However, such proposals have never gotten far in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> have raised the possibility of proceeding directly with such a veto to provoke a court challenge. But the subject gained new attention with a comment on Monday by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Asked if <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were prepared to make such a challenge now, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said: `` This is an issue in which he has stated a great deal of interest. And if he can find an appropriate part of a piece of legislation to test that constitutionality, I think that he would be inclined to do so.' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration is willing to force the issue and prompt a court case, believing that the president has such powers and should be able to exercise them. `` You just try to do it and see if it works. ... You claim you have the authority and you just do it,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, the spokesman said the president was intensifying his campaign for a cut in the tax on capital gains and plans to meet with senators, mostly Democrats, this week to lobby for the plan, which has already passed the House. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declared that the administration has the votes to pass the cut _ if it can have a straight majority-rule vote on the measure in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` Give us an opportunity for a vote, that's all we ask,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, accusing <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leaders of holding up the nation's budget `` just to make a point on capital gains.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met with about 10 Democratic senators to solicit advice on how to get his proposal approved. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Exon </PERSON>, D-Neb., told reporters later that he suggested delaying the matter until next year `` There's nothing critical about the economy right now that requires that we have a capital gains -LRB- cut -RRB- right now,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're going through a test of wills.'' He said that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has enough votes to block consideration of a reduction now. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a two-year cut in the tax rate on capital gains _ increases in the value of stocks, bonds and real estate _ to 19.6 percent from the current maximum rate of 33 percent.

 A judge ordered <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> to spend 72 hours behind bars Tuesday for slapping a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> policeman during a traffic stop, telling her `` if you slap a cop, you go to jail.'' Municipal Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> also ordered Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> to pay $ 2,937.50 in fines and penalties and $ 10,000 restitution for extraordinary costs to the city due to the case's notoriety. He directed the former beauty queen from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to perform 120 hours of community service at a shelter for homeless women. The judge repeatedly admonished and rebuked the sullen, sometimes smirking Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>, telling her she had shown contempt for justice, police and the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people and that she had tried to milk the case for publicity. `` The law applies to everyone, whether they are rich or poor and whether they are famous or not,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said before sentencing her. `` In the absence of extremely mitigating circumstances ... if you slap a cop, you go to jail.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> sentenced Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> to two concurrent 24-month jail terms, but suspended them and ordered her to serve 96 hours in jail, with credit for 24 hours served after her arrest June 14. Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s sentence requires her to serve the 72-hour term by Dec. 29, with no possibility of early release. Should she violate any condition of the sentence, she will have to serve 18 months. The judge said the sentence was common for such offenses. Defense attorney <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Bull </PERSON> said no decision had been made on whether to appeal Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s sentence or conviction. The actress was convicted Sept. 29 of battery on a police officer, driving without a valid driver's license and having an open container of alcohol in her car. She was acquitted of failing to obey an officer. The tempestuous Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> slapped Officer <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> on June 14 after he stopped her <ORGANIZATION> Rolls-Royce </ORGANIZATION> convertible. The actress testified that she instinctively struck out after <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> roughed her up. She said <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> had overreacted and used undue force in arresting her. During her trial, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s antics included rushing out of the courtroom and telling reporters that justice was better under the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> during World War II. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said she engaged in a `` public tantrum.'' `` It's time for you to stop it,'' the judge said. `` It's time for you to start acting like the lady you so repeatedly say you are.'' The judge still had to admonish Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> not to laugh during sentencing. Noting with a cough that she was `` admittedly in her mid-60s ... but otherwise vibrant and active,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> also said her age should play no role in sparing her time behind bars. The star of such B-movies as `` Queen of Outer Space'' and `` Picture Mommy Dead'' is secretive about her age, but according to court documents is 66. The judge told her to have her driver's license changed so it reflects her correct age, prompting laughter in the courtroom. He also directed that she be interviewed once by a psychiatrist. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> ordered Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> not to discuss her case or give interviews while doing her community service, and asked reporters to stay away from her then. The judge said her action `` verbally slapped the faces of every cop. `` She was not satisfied with that. She turned around and slapped the face of every American by comparing justice in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to Communist <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>,'' he said. In brief comments, outside court, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said, `` I'm a very good American. I love <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Why should I slap the face of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>?'' Her husband <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Anhalt </PERSON>, said, `` I'm very upset about it. I'm upset because they are sending my wife to jail.'' `` When she was first convicted, we felt that the Police Department and Officer <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> were vindicated,'' police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> said after Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s sentencing. `` We certainly feel that this is even further vindication.'' Wearing a black dress, Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> arrived at court in a black Mercedes Benz with her husband, passing before a crowd of about 100 reporters. She listened to character witnesses testify on her behalf with her chin thrust up, and at one point sprayed herself with perfume. Bull asked <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> to sentence Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> to probation. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Elden </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> argued for tough punishment. `` How dare the defendant suggest that she was not tried by a jury of her peers?,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` How dare she suggest they do not understand the class of people that she comes from?''

 A man driving home after an overseas vacation rushed to help victims of a coach crash and discovered his mother was the sole fatality, a relative said Tuesday. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, 24, arrived minutes after a coach skidded on a rain-slicked turn in the highway and overturned into a ditch Monday near his east coast hometown of <LOCATION> Skegness </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacklin </PERSON>, his grandmother. He had just driven 150 miles from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after a vacation in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. His 50-year-old mother, <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>, was returning the same day from a vacation in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Jacklin </PERSON> said her grandson ran to the coach when he heard cries for help and the first person he helped out of the wreckage turned out to be his mother's friend, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Milburn </PERSON>. `` Then it came to him that his mum was in there,'' she said. `` He could n't bring himself to go back inside. It was a terrible shock for him when he realized she was dead.'' Eight other people in the coach suffered minor injuries.

<TEXT>
 A man accused of dousing his pregnant daughter with a flammable liquid and setting her on fire was sentenced Tuesday to five to 25 years in prison, despite that the girl had asked the judge to be lenient. <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, 17, gave birth to a healthy girl by Caesarian section just hours after she suffered second - and third-degree burns on more than two-thirds of her body in July Summit County Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, 41, to five to 25 years for aggravated arson, three to 15 years for felonious assault and one year for child endangering. The sentences will run concurrently, but <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> must serve at least five years, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON>, law clerk for the judge. Ms. <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON>, who spent two months in a hospital burn unit before her release Sept. 21, appeared in court Tuesday and asked the judge to sentence her father to probation instead of a prison term. `` I think it was an accident,'' she told the judge. `` I do n't want him to go to prison. Ms. <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> wore a neck brace and gauze gloves, but said she felt all right. She also said her baby was doing fine. She declined to talk to reporters after the sentencing. On Sept. 26, <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> pleaded guilty to the charges in connection with the July 24 incident, which police said occurred during a family argument. Authorities said <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> told them he only wanted to scare his daughter and did n't want to hurt her. Police said they thought the flammable liquid was brake fluid. <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION> initially pleaded innocent by reason of insanity to the felony charges, but <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> reviewed a psychiatric report and ruled he was mentally competent to stand trial.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> claimed Tuesday in a $ 7 million lawsuit that the government was defrauded by a company that had a contract to relocate federal employees in 24 states.

 Tight security will be in effect for an 18-nation summit meeting because `` drug barons have put a price on the heads of some presidents,'' presidential spokesman <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> said Tuesday. <PERSON> Urbina </PERSON> did not say if the government knew which presidents had been threatened.

<HEAD>Commuters Take to Public Transportation, But for How Long?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Commuters in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area took to public transportation in unprecedented numbers Tuesday, and transit officials hope they make it a permanent habit. With so many of the 3 million commuters using public transit, traffic along the freeways flowed smoothly, despite predictions of gridlock. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> met with executives of 150 Bay area companies, urging them to encourage use of mass transit, car pools, vans, ferries, flexible work hours and modified truck delivery schedules. `` If stories begin to circulate that things are not as bad as expected, then greater numbers of people might start getting back in their cars rather than using mass transit or using ride sharing,'' he said. `` We want to caution people not to do that.'' <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a regional planning agency, and other transit officials say the transportation problems facing Northern Californians are not tied just to the Oct. 17 earthquake. For years, transit officials have tried to get Californians to make more use of public transportation and ease the overloaded highway system. But they were up against a virtual love affair between residents and their vehicles. Then the major earthquake forced changes for commuters used to driving to work, usually alone. `` They really need to make permanent adjustments,'' said <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON>. `` We might as well bite the bullet.'' Transit officials had feared massive traffic jams from the closure of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, but Tuesday they found smooth sailing for ferryboats, highway traffic and trains. `` The commute went excellent, everything went fine,'' said <PERSON> Vicki </PERSON> <PERSON> Wills </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rapid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> system, which runs trains beneath the Bay. `` No delays. We rated our commute this morning as excellent.'' <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> was expected to pick up many of the 65,000 people who normally enter <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> at rush hour in cars or buses. By 9 a.m. Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> had set a new weekday ridership record with 99,135, 4,300 more than the previous day. Traffic along highways and other roads was operating `` very smoothly,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Gappa </PERSON>. He said the accident rate was no higher than normal. For commuters arriving on <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> trains at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Civic Center stop, the morning trips were mostly routine, though a bit more crowded than usual. `` The train went quickly. It's working well,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmonds </PERSON>, a new <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> rider from <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. The regulatory analyst left 20 minutes later Tuesday, his second day on <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION>, and still made it to work on time. `` It was almost normal _ I could n't believe it,'' said longtime <ORGANIZATION> BART </ORGANIZATION> rider <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, a supervisor for Housing and Urban Development. `` There's a lot of new people and they seem to be making the adjustment.'' <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> also believes the quake may compel some people to begin using public transit for good. `` There's usually a silver lining in a lot of things. It's not surprising there will be a silver lining in this _ traffic and other things,'' said <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, the number of commuters using van and car pools was up 500 percent, according to the <ORGANIZATION> MTC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Diridon </PERSON>. But Red and White Fleet spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said Tuesday that less than half the available space on the fleet's 16 boats is being used by commuters despite free or cheap parking and reduced fares of $ 5 round-trip. The boats can handle more than 7,000 passengers, and the Tuesday morning count was about 3,200, he said. `` We're puzzled why ore people are n't trying this,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>. `` One television station had a picture of someone on a boat throwing up, and that did n't help much.'' <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> also said rough weather Monday `` spoooked people,'' but he said the bay was calmer Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> MTC </ORGANIZATION> had predicted that 2 million of the 3 million weekday commuters would encounter delays of some kind. Their fears were prompted by last wities, will be closed for at least one month. In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, a mile-plus section of Interstate 880, the <LOCATION> Nimitz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION>, collapsed, killing dozens. Other closed freeways include the Embarcadero Freeway along the waterfront in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and a five-mile stetch of Interstate 280, also in the city. In <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, only one lane of State Highway 17, a link to the <LOCATION> Silconn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, was open because of landslides and mudslides.

 Supporters of legislation that would ease restrictions on federally financed abortions for poor women scheduled a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote on Wednesday in an attempt to override President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto, hoping a changing political climate could give them a second surprise victory. Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., who sponsored the successful amendment, said, `` It's going to be very tough, but we're working to win. But opponents of the change, which would relax the prohibition on Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest, said they were confident they had the votes to upphold <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto. A two-thirds vote of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members present is needed to override the veto. If all 434 current members were present, 290 votes would be needed to override the veto. The liberalized abortion language passed on a 216-206 vote two weeks ago, and supporters acknowledged they had a long way to go to override the president. `` We do n't know how many votes we'll get tomorrow; we do n't know whether we'll get 217 or 270,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a supporter of expanded abortion availability. `` But ... we know the pendulum is swinging in our direction.'' The measure is part of a $ 156.7 billion appropriations bill for education, labor and health programs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was seeking `` room for flexibility'' on the issue immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote, but under pressure from anti-abortion supporters he hardened his stand and vetoed the bill on Saturday. `` The times are not changing,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., a leading abortion opponent `` We will sustain his veto tomorrow on the floor.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto `` mistaken'' and said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership was seeking votes to override the veto But he said the vote `` is not a party issue in the sense that we do n't recognize that other members of the party have a different position.'' The newest House Democrat is Rep. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, sworn in Tuesday after being elected in a special election last week. Standing with <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> at a swearing-in ceremony, <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> told reporters he opposes `` any federal funding for abortion'' and would vote to sustain <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto. But another freshman Democrat reversed a lifelong anti-abortion stance to announce he would vote to override the president. In what he described as `` the most difficult and agonizing decision'' of his political career, Rep. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Pallone </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> said he remains opposed to abortion. but has come to believe `` sound public policy and the needs of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> women are best served if access to legal and medically safe abortion is maintained.'' Supporters of the liberalized abortion language said they were urging colleagues to change their minds on the issue and were urging constituents to contact their representative. A conservative Repubican, Rep. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, said he supported the broader abortion language and believed some Republicans would shift to override the veto. `` I'm finding some movement in my <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> colleagues,'' <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> said. `` I think it's possible we just may override the president's veto.'' The abortion provision would reverse a law in effect since 1981 that bans all federally financed abortions for poor women under the Medicaid program, except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered by her pregnancy. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> had endorsed more relaxed abortion curbs, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had insisted on that language until its vote two weeks ago to accept the more liberal Senate-passed version. That vote came at a time when abortion-rights supporters said they were enjoying new political success since a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last summer gave the states more room to regulate abortions and brought new attention to the issue. The National Right to <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, the leading anti-abortion organization, distributed copies of a letter sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in June pleding to uphold any veto of more liberalized federal abortion laws. It said 152 House members signed that letter. That number, if all voted, would be more than enough to sustain a veto. On the group's list, however, were some members such as <PERSON> Ravenel </PERSON> who have since voted the other way or who did not vote two weeks ago.

<HEAD>First Injury Claims Filed With State</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The first of an expected long line of damage claims against the state from the Oct. 17 earthquake were filed Tuesday by two workers injured in the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway bridge, their lawyer said. The claims were filed with the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, whose rejection would clear the way for a lawsuit. They contend the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> had been aware for over a decade that the double-deck Interstate 880 structure was defective and dangerous in an earthquake. The lawyer, <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Blois </PERSON>, cited published reports of `` statements made by even <ORGANIZATION> CalTrans </ORGANIZATION> engineers and former engineers, references to interoffice memos, and the 1982 task force study that stated in essence that the elevated structure would receive extensive damage in an earthquake.'' `` Ever since the 1971 <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> quake and the problems that occurred there, the entire engineering world has known'' about the dangers, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Blois </PERSON> said. He said he was also in the process of having an independent study made. The workers, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Askia </PERSON> <PERSON> Y.M </PERSON>. Hurts of <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON>, were returning from a plumbing job in <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>'s car on the upper deck of the Cypress structure on I-880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> when it collapsed, the damage claim said. Authorities say the death toll in the collapse could reach 48. Hurts suffered head, back and neck injuries, had two teeth knocked out and four badly damaged, and got 43 stitches around the mouth, the claim said. It said <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> suffered a concussion, fractured ribs, neck and back problems, and injuries to his jaw and right arm. `` My clients have medical problems, they do n't have insurance, they're out of work and they want to get this thing moving as quickly as possible,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Blois </PERSON> said. He said they are at home and he did n't know when they would return to work. The <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, which usually rejects such claims routinely, has 14 days to act.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said Tuesday it had asked other countries to give Americans more opportunity to provide the services that make up an increasing part of international trade. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation on Monday presented a 20-page draft agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, to a meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the first such draft presented in complete form, said Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. Hills. Delegates from 107 countries are taking part in the negotiations, which for the first time are trying to cover trade in services _ everything from accounting to zoo management. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation presents proposals on Wednesday aimed at abolishing export subsidies for farm products within 10 years. A source in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> said Indian Delegate <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganesan </PERSON> told the closed-door meeting that an agreememnt must reflect the need of Third World countries to protect their own service companies against too much foreign competiton. He was supported by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, the source added. Ms. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> told a news conference that under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal the world market in services would be open to the greatest possible extent to firms everywhere. `` They would face a fair, predictable environment for their services throughout the world,'' said the official summary of the proposal. She said it seeks to: _ Enable firms from any country to set up shop in any other and be treated like local firms _ Limit governments' distortion of trade in services through regulations, subsidies and their own monopolies _ Require that national laws on services be <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, which is an organization as well as an agreement, has always dealt with trade in actual goods and not in what were once called `` invisibles.'' `` The problem today is that trade has outgrown the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said. `` Areas poorly govered by <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rules, like agriculture, or not covered at all, like services, investment and intellectual property -LRB- itemsw such as copyrights -RRB-, are of much greater importance than they once were.'' Now tourism, banking, insurance, airline services and computer work can be among a country's most significant exports or imports. `` All told, more than $ 1 trillion in goods and services trade is not adequately covered by international rules of fair play,'' Ms. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> complained. World trade in services last year totalled $ 560 billion. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> exported $ 90 billion worth of services last year and imported only about $ 70 billion, making a $ 20 billion contribution to the nation's balance of payments.

<TEXT>
 Activists from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> asked members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday to help stop <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> support of a gigantic dam project they said threatens to displace thousands of people without compensation and cause an environmental disaster. Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> natural resources subcommittee the <LOCATION> Narmada </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> project in three states of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> may be an example of development projects that `` undervalue the costs associated with environmental degradation and human displacement.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the largest contributor to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxpayers' dollars helped finance the project,'' thus <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should check the accuracy of criticism that the Narmada Dam was approved without proper environmental impact studies or resettlement plans, he said. A <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> representative said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> supported the project on the basis that those displaced would be compensated and that `` human welfare objectives of the project are met.'' Specific cost and contribution figures were not available. Continuing involvement by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> might be more helpful than a breakoff of support, however, in solving environmental and human welfare issues that `` have turned out to be more complex'' than anticipated, said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Vukmanic </PERSON>. `` The bank may be the only point of leverage to achieve needed environmental reforms,'' he added. `` If the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> backs away from this project, there is the possibility that private sources of funding may be available with no real prospect of resolving the problem.'' <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON> said 60,000 of the dam's `` intended beneficiaries'' demonstrated against its construction in September in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. The project will turn 100,000 farmers into migrant laborers and benefit mainly politicians, contractors and agricultural lobbies, testified <PERSON> Medha </PERSON> <PERSON> Patkar </PERSON>, a sociologist representing the Save the <ORGANIZATION> Narmada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. One hundred thirty-one cities north of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> will receive 90 percent of the project's benefits, she said, with only 10 percent of the benefit going to 4,720 villages. Indian economist <PERSON> Vijay </PERSON> <PERSON> Paranjpye </PERSON> said his own figures found calculations and cost overruns so serious that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> `` will not be able to complete the project in 25 years.''

 The government reported that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> exploded a 25-kiloton nuclear device Wednesday at its test site on <LOCATION> Mururoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atoll </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> condemned the action as an affront to residents of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. Government scientists said the blast was detected by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>'s seismological station in <LOCATION> Rarotonga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, at 5:30 a.m. local time. `` The countries of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> have made it abundantly clear on innumerable occasions that they have had enough of nuclear testing in the region,'' said Disarmament and Arms Control Minister <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>. `` The continued testing of these devices in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is an affront to all of us who live here,'' she said. <PERSON> Warwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Seismological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, said it was 108th test at <LOCATION> Mururoa </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> abandoned atmospheric testing there in 1975. It followed tests this year on May 11, May 20, June 3 and June 10 when the largest device, estimated to amount to 70 kilotons or the equivalent of 70,000 tons of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, was exploded. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said Wednesday's blast probably meant that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was beginning a new round of four tests for the remainder of this year. `` There was a series of four in May and June this year, and the pattern over the past five years has been two series of four each year,'' he said.

 A woman died of a head wound Tuesday following delivery of her baby, hours after she and her husband were abducted, robbed and shot by someone who apparently thought they were police. The suburban couple, drawn to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for its medical facilities, had recently said they were concerned about the rise in violence in the city, friends said. Police had no immediate suspects in the shooting. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> were located by the sound of police sirens coming through the cellular telephone <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> used to call for help before he passed out. Mrs. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, a 33-year-old lawyer, died early Tuesday at <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> and Women's Hospital. Just six hours earlier she and her husband had left that same hospital after attending their birthing class. The couple lived in Reading, 13 miles north of the city. The baby boy _ his parents had planned to call him <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, a friend said _ was delivered one month premature by Caesarean section, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> said. The hospital would not disclose the infant's condition. After leaving the hospital at about 8 p.m. Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION> were accosted by a man in the parking lot who got into their car and forced them to drive to an inner city neighborhood. There they were robbed of their watches and other belongings and shot. The gunman apparently thought the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION> were police officers because of the celluar phone in their car, said police Deputy Superintendent <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON>. Before shooting the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Dunford </PERSON>, the gunman said: `` I think you're five-o,'' slang for police. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, 29, general manager of a fur store in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Back </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, was in critical condition Tuesday at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> with a gunshot wound in the abdomen. State Police dispatcher <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> got a few details from <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> during the 10-minute call before he blacked out. `` My wife's been shot, I've been shot,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> said, according to an edited transcript of the call, which was punctuated by his groans. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> did n't know where he was, and acting on <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>'s instructions, drove to an intersection where he could see a street sign He passed out before he could give the dispatcher an intersection. Officers in patrol cars were told to flick their sirens on and off, one by one. The dispatcher was able to tell which police car was near the Stuarts' car from the sound of the sirens coming through the car phone. `` Get my wife out,'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> told the police officers who found him. The ambulance crew that came to the aid of <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and his wife had been riding with a camera crew from the CBS series `` Rescue 911,'' which tells real-life stories about rescue operations. The crew videotaped <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> regaining consciousness and talking about the attack as paramedics worked on him en route to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, and was allowed into the emergency room, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> told police Commissioner <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> `` he'd like to get every available detective'' on the case,'' police spokeswoman <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. At a press conference Tuesday, <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> was asked why this slaying was getting so much attention when shootings occur almost daily in other distressed areas of the city. `` There will be the same aggressive and fair and consistent enforcement of all our laws, regardless of where it takes place,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> and Women's is one of a number of hospitals clustered around <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Its setting is deceptive. The hospital complex is a stone's throw from <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, the affluent suburb where Gov <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lives, but it also is adjacent to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s crime-ridden <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> section and dark woods. Gang wars, drive-by shootings and drug-related violence are on the rise, perplexing and alarming residents and prompting police to conduct controversial on-the-spot searches. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakas </PERSON>, an owner of the fur store where <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> has worked for eight years, said the <ORGANIZATION> Stuarts </ORGANIZATION>' child was their first. They had just celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary, he said. `` So many senseless things going on,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaworski </PERSON>, 24, a close friend of <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> and assistant manager at the fur store. `` Last night the police commissioner told us you just have to keep fighting.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> will continue to extradite drug traffickers sought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and will not negotiate with the cocaine cartels. It said a decree issued Aug. 19 by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> allowing extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has been applied and will continue to be applied.'' Barco issued the decree after assassins shot to death a leading presidential candidate. Meanwhile, the bodyguard of a manager for the anti-drug crusading newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> was fatally shot Tuesday in western <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>. Police said the victim, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Osorio </PERSON>, was a member of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police force. Police said <PERSON> Osorio </PERSON> was walking to meet a female friend for lunch when two men approached him on a motorcycle and opened fire, a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police spokesman said in a telephone interview. After killing the bodyguard, police said the assassins chased down and murdered his friend, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, five blocks away. `` It seems the murders were a result of a personal dispute,'' the spokesman said. `` Drug traffickers had nothing to do with them.'' She said the assassins fled and that police had made no arrests in connection with the killings. The bodyguard had been assigned to protect <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>, who replaced one of the two <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> managers killed by hired hitmen in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> on Oct. 10. Hours after the assassinations, a man claiming to represent drug traffickers said in an anonymous phone call that the remaining 11 <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Espectador </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> would be killed if the paper did not close the bureau in that city, which is the hub of the most powerful Colombian cocaine cartel. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper, published a message from the drug dealers Tuesday saying they had interpreted a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling as declaring a Colombia-U.S. extratiditon treaty does exist but was not signed correctly. That brought immediate speculation in the local news media that the court had struck down possible extraditions. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said that in applying the presidential decree on extradition it will remain within the constitutional bounds set by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in its latest ruling. The council is composed of the president, the chief of police intelligence, the attorney general and the ministers of defense, interior and justice. Referring to the drug traffickers' message in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> the council said, `` Organized crime is continuing its misinformation campaign.'' In rejecting negotiations with the drug cartels the council said: `` The government has undertaken a policy of combating drug trafficking and its criminal organizations, and nowhere in this campaign is there room for either a dialogue or negotiations with traffickers. `` No proposal by either drug traffickers or their representatives will be accepted.'' The traffickers' message in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION> repeated previous proposals. It asked for talks with the government to end extraditions if the drug dealers agreed to abandon all illicit trafficking activities in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. There was a delay in the release of a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling Oct. 5 and the court released only some parts of its decision. Some lawyers argued the ruling struck down extraditions. A court comment released after the ruling said there were two permissible ways for Colombians to be extradited to other countries: One is through an extradition treaty and when no treaty exists the president may use decree powers to permit extradition. The question of whether a Colombian-U. S treaty exists was left to the government to The Barco government, apparently deciding there is no treaty, has extradited four people to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the presidential decree. Three were extradited after the Oct. 5 court ruling. A 1979 extradition treaty was nullified by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in two different rulings because it was not signed by then-President <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Turbay </PERSON>. The treaty had been signed by the acting president while <PERSON> Turbay </PERSON> was out of the country.

 The mayor announced an internal investigation Tuesday into how the Police Department let a confessed murderer and mob informant buy drugs, carry guns and collect welfare while in its custody as a protected witness. It will be at least the third investigation into the custody and death of admitted three-time murderer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, who died of a heart attack in June 1988 while on his way to an unsupervised skydiving trip in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. Packages containing 9 grams of cocaine were found in <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s parachute bag Later investigations showed that while in police custody, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was paid at least $ 98,000, took trips, charged meals and liquor to the state and bought bullets and jewelry at taxpayers' expense. Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who maintains he did n't know <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was in department custody, said his action was prompted by `` outrageous revelations'' of recent weeks, including reports that a police officer was videotaped joking with <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> about the free ride they were getting. <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> appointed Family Court Judge <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuirl </PERSON> to conduct the review. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Almond </PERSON>, who has turned down repeated requests for grand jury inquiry, saying the matter lacks federal jurisdiction, recused his office from further involvement last week after learning a woman who is now a secretary in his office had traveled to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with a police officer who was supervising <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> on one of his seven trips there. The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday that <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s wife had a videotape of a police officer joking with her husband about the free ride they were getting <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON>, told the newspaper the tape shows Detective <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> with his arm around her husband's shoulders saying, `` The criminal justice system has been good to us, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, huh?'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> responded by hoisting a soda in a toast and thanking former Attorney General <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Violet </PERSON>. WPRI-TV on Tuesday night broadcast videotapes of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and police officers cavorting at a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> motel swimming pool. The station said the officers were supposed to have been guarding him. The tape showed the encounter with Cross. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> also videotaped a police officer sleeping in a poolside lounge chair while he was supposed to be guarding the witness, the station said. `` Hard time, tough duty,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said on the tape as he laughed, WPRI-TV said. The station said <PERSON> Cross </PERSON> claimed he was `` play acting'' to make <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> feel at ease. Mrs. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> told the station she gave her husband a gun while he was in police custody and that she had one as well. As a convicted felon, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> could not legally carry a firearm. Cross was recently transferred from the detective division to the auto squad, which investigates stolen cars, said Police Officer <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON>. Police Chief <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> has previously declined comment on the transfer or the tape and did n't return calls Tuesday. Violet was not at her law office Tuesday and did not return phone calls. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office recommended an investigation last week. <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> denied any political motivation in requesting the city review. <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON>, a Democrat, is expected next year to challenge Repubican Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON>, who announced a state police investigation of the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> case last week. <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> said <PERSON> McGuirl </PERSON>'s review would be different from the state police investigation because it would look into `` appropriate disciplinary actions and administrative changes,'' while the state police investigation is looking into possible criminal actions. `` I'm just looking internally as to what happened in the past and, more fundamentally, at the department as a whole,'' said <PERSON> McGuirl </PERSON>, who will not have subpoena power. An eight-month investigation by Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> police said police failed to properly supervise <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> but recommended no disciplinary action. Former police chief Col. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, in charge when <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s protective custody was arranged, resigned as head of the attorney general's drug force Monday, saying he did not want to be `` a political pawn.'' <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON> said he would await <PERSON> McGuirl </PERSON>'s report before taking any disciplinary action. `` Let the chips fall where they may,'' he said. Police Chief <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, and Cmdr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamburini </PERSON>, who was in charge of <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>'s supervision, did not immediately return phone calls Tuesday. Two of the officers in the security detail have committed suicide. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, 43, was a key witness in two trials and was expected to testify against alleged organized crime figures. In the 30 months he was in police custody, <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was kept at a police station apartment, then transferred in January 1988 to a safe house, while serving a 10-year sentence for murder. <PERSON> Paolino </PERSON>, who took office in April 1984, said that `` if the name <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> was ever mentioned in my presence it was made with a host of other issues and the name would have been meaningless to me.''

 Safety drills were a weekly occurrence at the <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plastics plant, but when an emergency siren sounded before a series of devastating explosions, hundreds of employees just ran. In all, 124 were injured, 35 hospitalized and at least two died in the blasts at the plant Monday. Twenty-two other workers were missing and presumed dead on Tuesday. Maintenance worker <PERSON> Roby </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemons </PERSON> said that employees had 20 seconds to escape after a warning message was broadcast over the plant's emergency radio. Workers said they heard a hissing sound and saw a white cloud. The explosion that followed knocked them off their feet. `` Each area has an evacuation area, but in some cases you just run. We just ran. There's nothing you can do but run,'' said <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ogden </PERSON>, a plant worker for 14 years. The explosion sent pieces of metal and concrete flying through the air, he said. `` I dove underneath a front-end loader until I did n't see anything else coming down. It was bad. I heard a big hiss, then I seen a cloud. I knew something was wrong. Something like that happens so quick. You ca n't do anything about it. The plant tested its emergency alarm system every Monday, officials said. The alarms had been tested in the morning before Monday's blast and there were no problems, said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman in <LOCATION> Bartlesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON>, a general maintenance employee, said the plant had an evacuation plan, but the volume of Monday's accident rendered it obsolete `` Just the size of it ... you just have to get out of there.'' <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Jere </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he did not know when the last evacuation plan was practiced. According to <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a deputy coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> Pasadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the Phillips plant was the scheduled site for an annual emergency drill scheduled for Nov. 8. `` It's an annual drill, and we were working on some of the areas we identified as deficiencies in our 1988 drill ... elements of triage and communications,'' she said. `` We take safety very seriously. I ca n't explain at this time what happened down there,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> environmental director. `` We're awaiting getting in there to make a full assessment on that.'' Crews of nearby chemical plants as well as fire departments from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, Deer Park, and <PERSON> LaPorte </PERSON> responded to Monday's accident They were among various firefighting crews from 96 factories and six cities in the area that formed a collective emergency response plan in 1955, in the wake of major accidents and fires along the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION>.

 Only nine people remained unaccounted for Tuesday _ one week after <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>'s ravaging earthquake _ and geologists predicted a 50-50 chance by Christmas of a major aftershock capable of causing considerable damage. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Survey </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday also revised upward the magnitude of the Oct. 17 quake, from 6.9 to 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Church bells tolled at 5:04 p.m., one week to the minute after the quake. And 83 minutes later, at 6:27 p.m., the strongest aftershock in four days, with a <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale reading of 4.5, rattled the area. There were no immediate reports of damage. A $ 2.85 billion quake aid bill passed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House. Survivor Buck Helm's condition improved to serious with his kidney function reported normal. Demolition crews were taking down sections of Interstate 880 in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> for fear still-standing sections of the elevated, double-deck structure could tumble like dominoes onto the 1 \ - mile stretch that collapsed in the Oct. The death toll rose to 63 with a coroner's discovery of a 39th victim among the remains dug out of the rubble of I-880, which was thefirst elevated freeway built in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. But authorities have been able to account for all but nine of the 280 reported missing during the last week, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Wraa </PERSON> said. `` I'm not willing to speculate how many of those nine missing people may or may not be up there,'' <PERSON> Wraa </PERSON> said, referring to the collapsed freeway. Rescue crews have not been able to locate other bodies in the rubble, where 55 cars were trapped at rush-hour _ a number considered well below a normal Tuesday, possibly because of the scheduled third game of the World Series between the Bay area's two major league baseball teams. A traffic officer reported he was `` surprised at how light traffic was'' five minutes before the quake, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noble </PERSON> said. Four sections remain inaccessible to searchers. Digging was to resume when the threatening sections were taken down, possibly by Thursday. There was no hope of finding anyone alive, authorities said. `` The people that are -LRB- unaccounted for -RRB-, I believe are responsible people. Many of their cars have been found on that interchange and for whatever reason their loved ones have not had contact with them,'' <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. `` We've sent officers out to check their homes, check their jobs, and every four hours we're talking to the families,'' he said. Seismologists at the geological survey said they revised the quake's <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> reading to 7.1 after checking data from 18 seismic stations around the world. `` The original magnitude of 6.9 was based on more localized seismic readings,'' said <PERSON> Waverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Person </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earthquake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Golden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> issued a long-range aftershock forecast predicting over the next two months an 11 percent chance of a temblor of magnitude 6.0 or larger, and a 50 percent chance of one registering 5.0 or larger. On the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale of earthquake magnitude, 5.0 is considered capable of considerable damage, and 6.0 capable of severe damage. State emergency coordinators have said that an aftershock of 5.0 could be especially troublesome to buildings already damaged or weakened by the initial earthquake. The probabilities were based on statistics for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquakes, and not on actual measurements at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andreas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fault </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> geophysicist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Luetgert </PERSON> said. More than 3,500 aftershocks, some almost imperceptible, had been detected by Tuesday morning, the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> said. The strong aftershock Tuesday evening was centered 14 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> said. The aftershock was the largest since the 4.6 aftershock that occurred about 9:15 p.m. Saturday, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgenson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION>. `` It felt pretty sharp and fairly long, but I guess it lasted only seven to 10 seconds,'' said <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> police dispatcher <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Minuti </PERSON>. `` We had a few phone calls right away but no reports of damage.'' Engineers reported Tuesday that the toppled 50-foot section of the Bay Bridge was unrepairable. Officials for the transportation department said they hope to put up a new five-lane section on the lifeline across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> by Nov. 16. Commuters, left without the bridge and several stretches of freeway, fared well again Tuesday, using public transit in record numbers, transportation officials said. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON>, speaking to business leaders, praised efforts to reduce traffic and warned against lapsing into regular cummuting patterns. `` We've got some longterm concerns here,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 321-99 to send $ 2.85 billion in earthquake-relief funds to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was expected to concur Wednesday and send the legislation to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In a floor speech before the vote, Rep. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelosi </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, pleaded for `` a chance to rebuild.'' She said, `` We were hit by 10 times the amount of explosive power of World War II, including the atomic bomb.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> called on the federal government to raise the maximum home rebuilding loan to $ 500,000 from $ 100,000, reflecting high housing costs in the region. `` One-hundred thousand dollars in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> can make a big difference. It does n't here,'' <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> alone, 750 to 1,000 buildings need extensive repair, <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> told the city-county <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervisors </ORGANIZATION> on Monday. He estimated damage in the city at $ 2.2 billion to $ 3.2 billion. <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Walthall </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, said the utility estimates they'll need to replace about 10 miles of gas distribution lines in the hard-hit <LOCATION> Marina </LOCATION> district, at an estimated cost of $ 10 million. He did not know how long that work would take, and said the utility was awaiting clearance from the city before beginning the work. About 5,100 customers are without gas service in the district, and that about 1,000 customers are also without electric service, <PERSON> Walthall </PERSON> said. Fire officials reported five homes were evacuated on Monday and Tuesday when heavy rains caused landslides in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> mountain communities of <LOCATION> Zayante </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. No injuries were reported. Since the quake, as many as 90 homeowners around <PERSON> Zayante </PERSON> made the `` common sense decision'' to leave their uninhabitable homes without being ordered to evacuate, said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Boynton </PERSON>, district fire chief. Some of the houses slid and leaned against trees, while others were reduced to rubble. Already, damage from the quake _ estimated at more than $ 7 billion _ has surpassed Hurricane Hugo as the costliest disaster in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> said he would call a special legislative session within two weeks to work out the state's response to the devastation. Documents on file at the state transportation department in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> show that I-880, opened in July 1957 at a construction cost of $ 10.2 million, was the first elevated freeway in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. A nearly identical roadway built soon after, the Embarcadero in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, probably will be closed until June due to earthquake damage. Unlike its near-twin in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, this structure will be repaired rather than replaced. Along the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> coastline near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, rocks continued to fall of cliffs damaged by the earthquake, making the beaches below unsafe, the <ORGANIZATION> USGS </ORGANIZATION> said. `` There are many cracks along the tops of coastal bluffs, and some of these could collapse without warning,'' the agency said. About a half-dozen wineries in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> region reported a jumble of 500-pound wine barrels that rolled off madly leaping racks stacked to the ceiling. Some lost precious bottles from their wine `` library,'' the collection all wineries have of every vintage produced.

 Police reported Wednesday that two rifle bullets were found in the Putra World Trade Center where the 49-nation <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> held its annual summit. The bullets for a U.S.-made M-16 rifle were found by a constable Oct. 12, days before the summit opened its first session on Oct. 18, according to Police Inspector General <PERSON> Haniff </PERSON> <PERSON> Omar </PERSON>. The summit ended Tuesday. <PERSON> Haniff </PERSON> also said that on Oct. 11 a telephone call, purportedly from the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was received at national police headuarters and the caller threatened to kill British leaders attending the summit. <PERSON> Haniff </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s highest ranking police officer, said information about the ammunition and telephone call were withheld to facilitate investigations. He said precautionary measures were taken but police found no explosives or additional ammunition and no arrests have been made. Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> arrived on the royal yacht Brittania for a state visit to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> Oct. 14-18 and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> attended the summit, which ended without incident Tuesday. <PERSON> Haniff </PERSON> said a note written in Malay was found with the two bullets that read `` Chogm merbahaya, <LOCATION> Hisbollah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>,'' which means `` Danger, <LOCATION> Hisbollah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The president of the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was quoted Tuesday as saying the fund is preparing new loans for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which lost its access to low-interest Western cash after its crackdown on pro-democracy protesters. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted Bank President <PERSON> Masao </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujioka </PERSON> as telling Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> that the bank and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should cooperate. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is making active preparations for some loan projects with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and these will soon be handed over to the ... board of directors for discussion,'' <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> paraphrased <PERSON> Fujioka </PERSON> as saying. No details of the loans were given. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has lost other sources of low-interest loans since June, when the Chinese army cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators. Several Western governments froze new development loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in protest, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries pressured the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to freeze its loans. Although <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> has said he expects to see the bank resume new loans soon, bank members delayed voting on the matter at a September meeting. Many private foreign bankers are hesitating to make new loans because of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economic problems and its decision to slow industrial growth. However, there have several signs that the financial freeze is ending. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has said it will begin gradually resuming aid projects that it froze in June. In addition, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> recently decided to go ahead with a $ 239 million low-interest loan to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that will help build a subway in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fujioka </PERSON> and more than 30 foreign bankers were in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to attend a conference on policies for poor countries.

<HEAD>Inquest Reports High Methane Levels at Kentucky Mine Before Blast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Workers detected high levels of methane at the <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> four days before an explosion there killed 10 men, a state inspector testified Tuesday. The air was 6 percent methane in one section of the mine when tested Sept. 9, but the high level of gas alone does not explain the blast, said <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, an inspector for the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION>. `` You had a 6 percent level on Saturday before the explosion,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` That is an explosive level and it did n't explode. You've got to have an ignition source.'' Workers adjusted fireproof curtains to allow more air into the mine, assigned a miner to monitor the methane level while they worked, and warned incoming crews of the high gas levels before the blast, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said at a state hearing on the Sept. 13 explosion, the worst <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mining disaster since 1984. Methane is considered explosive in levels of from 5 percent to 15 percent. Four of the bodies were found in the area where miners had detected the high methane levels, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. Workers in the section of the mine where the blast occurred were dismantling a longwall mining machine. Mining in that area had been completed Sept. 6. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Siler </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Pyro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the mine owner, said officials did not learn until after the explosion of the high methane reading. `` At the time of the explosion, we were depending on the men in the area to take their own measurements,'' <PERSON> Siler </PERSON> said during questioning from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, an attorney representing miners' widows Testimony indicated investigators are considering several possible causes for the accumulation of methane, including water that blocked the mine's primary ventilation system and a regulator, or curtain, that no longer was being used to allow air to flow through the mine. What ignited the blast has not been established. Among the sources under investigation were electrical equipment, acetylene torches believed to have been in use before the explosion, and rock falls that might have sparked wire rope cables. Under questioning from an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION>, mine superintendent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> said workers were randomly searched before going into the mine and terminated if found to be carrying cigarettes. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>, general superintendent at <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION>, testified a cigarette butt had been found found in the area of the explosion. But <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, commissioner for the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION>, said the cigarette was not found near the bodies and he did not believe it sparked the blast. There were 330 workers underground at the time of the explosion, <PERSON> Siler </PERSON> said.

 Friends and relatives of workers who were in a plastics plant when it blew up waited and clung to shreds of hope Tuesday as the search for victims continued. `` My best friend is in there, I think,'' said <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 27. `` He has n't called his mother and sister, and he did n't come home last night.'' The explosions Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 5 plant left at least two people dead, 22 workers missing and presumed dead and 124 people injured. On Tuesday, people gathered in small groups at <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which sits across <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Highway 225 from the blackened rubble of the plant. They talked quietly, trying to learn who was still among the missing. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergne </PERSON>, 38, found the name of her husband, <PERSON> Cipriana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 43, who had been working in the building that exploded. `` I had just taken him lunch,'' said Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergne </PERSON>. `` I heard the explosion when I was going back home.'' She recalled that a much smaller explosion several months ago was followed by a call from <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to tell her he was OK. `` He called me right away then, so when I did n't hear from him this time, I knew something was wrong,'' Ms. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Vergne </PERSON> said At 10:30 p.m. Monday, her husband's supervisor and another <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> official came to her house to tell her that her husband was missing. `` I can only keep on hoping,'' she said Tuesday, collapsing in tears onto the steering wheel of her pickup. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, who works in the plant's distribution department, leaned against a highway overpass buttress, his sunglasses masking reddened eyes. He has been calling his friend's relatives regularly, but hope has dwindled. `` They're sitting by the phone and it wo n't even go for a full ring before they pick it up. They say, ` <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>?' and I say, ` No, it's just me.' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Porte </LOCATION>, came so he could retrieve his truck, which is still parked inside the plant. His ears were still ringing from the blast, which knocked him to the ground from about 100 yards away. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> shook his head as he thought about how close he had come to death. `` We ran for our lives,'' he said. `` Some people wanted to stop and I just told them to keep on going, because you ca n't tell what's going to happen next. And there were more explosions.''

On Aug. 31, the Tucayana hijacked a ferry at the same place. The boat seized Tuesday replaced the one captured in August. Like the army, the Tucayana oppose the peace accord because it calls for the 200 to 400 Jungle Commando fighters to become a special police unit in the interior, where most of the Amerindians live.

 <ORGANIZATION> Egon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> warned East Germans on Tuesday to stop street demonstrations, but up to 12,000 marched in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after dark to protest his election as president. Police directed traffic out of their way. The ritual election by the customarily docile parliament was made dramatic when some members voted `` no'' for the first time. In a speech afterward, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said continuing weeks of pro-democracy protest could cause a `` worsening of the situation, or confrontation.'' At nightfall, lines of East Berliners carrying candles marched through the central district, chanting `` Egon, who sked us?'' _ a recurring phrase since <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> became <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief last week _ and `` We are the competition!'' Police did not interfere, and kept the route clear of traffic. ADN, the official news agency, reported the protest without criticism. `` Several thousand people, mostly youths'' carried banners and chanted slogans denouncing the election and `` demanding changes in the election laws, more democracy and an open press,'' it said. It estimated the number of marchers in the two-hour protest as `` as high as 12,000 at times.'' On Monday in <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, more than 300,000 people marched in the largest protest of the nation's 40-year history. After his election, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s allegiance to Communist orthodoxy, despite the reform sweeping through the Soviet bloc. He also promised to investigate charges of police brutality against pro-democracy demonstrators earlier this month. The new leader, who succeeded <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> as Communist party chief and president, was in charge of police at the time. Officials admitted for the first time Tuesday that police attacked peaceful protesters. In a report carried by the official news agency, the government said: `` There were instances where security officials exceeded their authority and illegal acts were committed against some of those detained.'' ADN said officials decided police should use restraint `` unless there is violence or the threat of violence,'' and had prohibited the use of firearms. It said police commanders had apologized to victims of verifiable brutality. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said 83 complaints were under review and prosecutors had taken up four cases, according to the report prepared by the parliament committees on national defense and justice affairs. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> said in his speech, `` Proper steps will be taken if the evidence warrants them. Anyone who was treated unjustly has the right to take advantage of their legal rights.'' Twenty-six members of the 500-seat People's Chamber voted against <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> for president, although he was the only candidate, and 26 abstained, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> reported. It was the first time members of the Communist-controlled chamber had voted against the sole candidate for president. After his election, the 52-year-old leader declared to the legislators: `` Demonstrations, however peacefully they may be planned and thought out, carry within themselves the danger of ending in a different way from how they started. `` That is unsettling to many people, and rightly so. Our society, which has so many new things to tackle, is thus put under increasing tension.'' In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Tuesday he was prepared to meet with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s new leader to advance inter-German relations. `` If it is seen as useful by both sides ... from my side there are no difficulties in the way of a well-prepared meeting taking place,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s official news agency swiftly reported the summit offer. <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> and his colleagues have said they will exclude the growing opposition from talks about change in a system whose rigidity has caused tens of thousands of East Germans to flee and hundreds of thousands to protest. The Communist leadership says there already are enough officially recognized groups in which to discuss necessary changes. `` Renewal of society requires the strong socialist foundation, which was put in place in a joint effort,'' <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said. Opposition groups have released written statements from witnesses and victims describing brutal treatment by police during protests and while people were in custody. Many victims said they were forced to stand naked for hours in frigid holding cells. Others reported being beaten and humiliated by officers after street protests Oct. 7-8 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Police used clubs to disperse the demonstrators and arrested hundreds. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> said he would seek `` new impulses'' for possible change from President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, who champions reform, during a forthcoming visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Representatives of several hundred workers at the <PERSON> Wilhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieck </PERSON> electronics factory said in a statement Monday they had organized an independent labor union called Reform that demands the right to strike, and to set wages and prices at the factory. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> denied such a union had been formed. Party leaders are expected to oppose independent unions that could gain widespread support and challenge the Communist monopoly on power, as occurred with Solidarity in neighboring <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 Workers removed an earthquake-damaged section of the lower deck of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco-Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> on Tuesday, leaving a hole in the structure nearly as glaring as the hole in the region's transportation system. Fifty-foot sections, one atop the other, have now been yanked out of both levels of the double-decked 53-year-old bridge. Officials for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> will build new sections, each five lanes wide, and lift them into place. They estimate the work will take at least one month. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Saville </PERSON>, a spokesman for the department, said he believed it was the first time such large pieces had been removed since the major highway link between the cities opened in 1936. `` It's a big hole,'' he said. For <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area residents who escaped injury or property damage, the closure of the bridge may be the biggest inconvenience of the earthquake, <PERSON> Saville </PERSON> said. The bridge is normally used by 260,000 cars each day. The state is losing an estimated $ 130,000 a day in tolls. The 200-ton lower section had been declared a total loss shortly after the Oct. 17 earthquake. It was chopped into four pieces and lowered more than 200 feet by crane to a barge floating next to a bridge tower in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials had hoped to repair the upper section, and undertook a delicate two-day effort to lower that section last weekend. The upper section was cut into just two pieces and lowered, but a close inspection showed the steel framework could not be salvaged, <PERSON> Saville </PERSON> said. The repairs will cost $ 1 million, the agency has said. Department planners had accounted for the possibly the upper section would be unusable, and had already drafted a design for new construction so the repair time estimate did not have to be extended, <PERSON> Saville </PERSON> said. The 8.5-mile-long bridge had become the symbol of the World Series between <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Nationally broadcast pictures of the broken bridge, with the upper deck dangling, provided the first graphic illustration of the magnitude of the 7.1 <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale quake. One woman died when she drove her car into the gap.

 The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a tough abortion control bill intended to make the state the first to take advantage of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing more restrictions. After nearly nine hours of debate, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 143-58 for the new controls and sent the bill to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which recessed earlier Tuesday and will not return until Nov. 13. Most attempts to weaken the bill were easily defeated during the long session. Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> has said he backs abortion restrictions proposed by Republican state Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON>, the state's leading anti-abortion lawmaker, who opened debate on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor by calling abortion an `` inherently violent'' act He asked his fellow lawmakers: `` Abortion is the most wrenching social issue of our time, but since when do we solve our social problems with violence?'' Freind called the bill `` a moderate, common sense approach to this issue.'' Earlier Tuesday, also by a 143-58 vote, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved adding the abortion control language into a pending bill toughening penalties for incest. A pro-choice leader, Democratic state Rep. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, argued during debate that the government has no right to intrude on a woman's decision whether to have an abortion. She said restrictions proposed by Freind trivialize `` one of the most important decisions a woman can make. ... Why ca n't we trust a woman to make the decision when to have a child.'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> legislators have repeatedly voted for abortion controls since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision made most abortions legal. Efforts to impose new restrictions started anew after July, when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> cleared the way in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case for states to impose new restrictions on abortion. The anti-abortion proposals under consideration in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> include a ban on abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except in cases where the mother faces irreversible harm, and a prohibition on abortions for sex selection. Others include a requirement that women inform their husbands if they plan to get an abortion, and a 24-hour waiting period. `` We've lost amendments in the past and we may lose some amendments today, but I think we'll pass the bill,'' <PERSON> Freind </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> called Freind's measure `` the most dangerous abortion bill in any state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in the nation.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> said there was an outside chance of swinging enough votes to defeat it. `` We're not giving up hope on it yet,'' she said. The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, called into special session by Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, recently rejected all of his proposed abortion restrictions. Last week, a committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> blocked a bill to restrict abortions.

 One night recently police raided several bars in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and arrested a dozen people for various violations. Law enforcement still exists in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, but just barely. For years, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 7,000-man police force has been a virtual bystander in the civil war and the feuds between heavily armed militias, powerless to stanch the lawlessness that has engulfed the country since 1975. But since a cease-fire Sept. 22 halted the most recent fighting between Syrians and Christians, the police have slowly begun enforcing the law again. `` We're like the turtle. It moves slowly, but in the end, when no one expects it, it gets to where it's going,'' said Col. <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Zein </PERSON>, a senior aide to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s chief of detectives, Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Issam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON>. As the war dragged on, killings, robberies, kidnappings and drug abuse went virtually unchecked. There have been 60,000 bank hold-ups since 1975, according to police statistics. Much of this was the work of the unruly militias, who maintained their own rough justice, usually summary executions for those who violated their rules. But ordinary street crime was also rampant, fueled by a sharply deteriorating economy. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, long a major source of hashish and lately heroin, became a thriving domestic market as war-traumatized youngsters turned to drugs. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s prisons and courts ceased to function years ago. Militiamen have emptied the prisons many times over, freeing friends and relatives and leaving the gates open for other inmates. An estimated 7,000 murderers, rapists, gunmen and thieves have been freed this way since 1975. But in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, at least, the police are hitting back. In May, amid the Syrian-Christian battles, 30 gunmen freed 189 inmates from the central prison in <LOCATION> Moslem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, killing a police sergeant. Most were recaptured by police and headquarters ordered the arrest of the gunmen hiding out with the militias in the mountains. In mid-October, a patrol spotted one of the raiders in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>; he was shot and killed when he tried to pull a gun. The police force comprises a detectives division, vice, riot and traffic squads, a police academy and units of gendarmes who operate in the countryside. Though all the fighting the police force has remained intact, with Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> officers cooperating with each other, something rarely seen nowadays in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The state treasury pays police salaries, but it has been unable to finance new recruits since 1986. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON>, the detective chief, said public support for the police has reawakened in recent weeks. He noted that anonymous telephone tipoffs have helped round up scores of drug traffickers and users. `` We're getting hundreds of such tips now. The number grows every day,'' he said. One of the main police functions in recent years has been keeping statistics of the violence and casualties. But the police still have a long way to go before they'll be able to regain the authority police departments in other countries take for granted. Every morning, Sgt. <PERSON> Naji </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Haidar </PERSON> puts on his khaki uniform, climbs on his 25-year-old <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> motorcycle and roars off into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s chaotic traffic. He hands out tickets to violators, cools down hot-tempered cab drivers and tries to unsnarl the clogged streets. But when militiamen start shooting at each other, often over nothing more than who gets served first at a gasoline station, Sgt. <PERSON> Abu-Haidar </PERSON> looks the other way. After 14 years of war, he knows the rules of survival. `` I'll be retiring in a couple of years,'' he said, `` and I do n't plan to get killed.''

<HEAD>`Kojak' Star Plays Has-Been TV Detective in Cable Comedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a case of cable spoofing art, the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Network </LOCATION> tonight is airing `` The Hollywood Detective,'' a sly comedy about a once-famous TV detective fallen on hard times. It stars Telly Savalas. Savalas, of course, did n't fall on hard times when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> axed his `` Kojak'' series in 1978. He's even returning to television Nov. 4 as the tough <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cop in a new `` Kojak,'' part of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Saturday Mystery'' series But <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'s movie does make you think, particularly at one point when a reporter asks <PERSON> Savalas </PERSON>' faded TV detective, middle-aged actor <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, the name and network of his old TV series. The faded star beams. `` Oh, yes,'' he casually says. `` ` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowne </PERSON>, Private Investigator,' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. You know, there is talk recently about renewing the series, and I ...'' Two real police detectives hustle him away. A funny moment. Savalas is wonderful in it and throughout the film. He shows a previously unseen comic side, playing a ham who made millions in eight years as a TV detective but has n't worked in 12 years. Although our hero visibly inflates when someone recognizes him, he now lives alone, unloved and unemployed in his personal <LOCATION> Tap </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, an ancient <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> bungalow surrounded by dry weeds. `` Detective'' vaguely echoes a nifty <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Carney-Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> movie of 1977, `` The Late Show,'' complete with a flakey <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> lady, sweetly portrayed here by <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Udy </PERSON>. But it's gently funny in its own way. The two-hour film concerns, give or take, a missing-persons case that our hero reluctantly accepts, aware that he's no detective. But he also is aware he needs money. Bills are piling up, his stove was repossessed, and he has n't even a hot plate on which to warm his dinner, a can of tamales. Still, he remains a ham, even with cold tamales. Up for a small part as an <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> priest in a TV movie at <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION>, he recalls in his gumshoe-movie narration that `` the studio had been good to me once, and I figured I owed them one.'' Nope, the network says His sleazy agent -LRB- nicely played by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Coe </PERSON> -RRB-, a fan of porn movies, says he could land him the lead in a new `` personal picture'' called `` Author of Lust.'' Throttling Coe, the enraged actor shouts the worst insult he can muster: `` You agent, you!'' But when all seems lost, there is a knock on his door. The knocker -LRB- Udy -RRB- is a young woman, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> Wednesday. Like some <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> inmates, she is not what network executives would call reality-based. This is not just because her hair has tints of purple and blue, the number of her apartment is `` 1412 -RCB-,'' and her phone is shaped like a tennis shoe. No, it is because she thinks <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, the actor, really can solve a case. The case is her missing boyfriend. They met, had a fling, `` and then he kinda sorta moved in,'' she explains in her wistful, wispy voice. But he has disappeared, leaving behind $ 10,000 in cash. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, actor, explains that he is no detective. However, with the chance of earning $ 100 a day, plus expenses, he thinks that `` maybe, just maybe, being a real detective was n't much different than being one on TV.'' He soon learns that there is a small difference as he goes through plot twists involving medflies, blackmail, the <ORGANIZATION> Hollenbeck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, a car chase, his arrest as a murder suspect, and a once-great TV story consultant he summons when the case gets too baffling. There also are two stiffs. While the proceedings sag slightly near the gunfire-filled finale, this `` Detective,'' well-written by <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> and deftly directed by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Connor </PERSON>, is a fine and funny film. You'll like it

 Elsewhere on television ... ANOTHER REASON TO CONTINUE LIVING: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s cable operation, <ORGANIZATION> CNBC </ORGANIZATION>, has hired <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>. You may recall him as the host of a much-publized, now-defunct syndicated talk show It featured a lot of shouting and he would bellow `` Zip it!'' to those with whom he disagreed. Starting Dec. 4, he will host `` Showdown,'' a half-hour weeknight series in which he will debate great issues with another regular, <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> columnist <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. Guest experts also will check in and, as was the case in his old series, there will be a studio audience. However, says <ORGANIZATION> CNBC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> has `` pledged to be much different than what he was in his old show'' and that his new show will be `` toned down.'' And that the audience will not get to shout.

 In laboratories around the world, researchers are developing weapons to defend against life's biggest killers. They look for major steps forward in the 1990s. This is one of a periodic series of articles, `` The'90s,'' looking ahead o the promise and peril of the upcoming decade, in the environment, medicine, technology and society.

 Two big killers will count their victims in the millions in the 1990s _ 13 million <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives claimed by heart disease and cancer if the current fatality rate continues. But medical researchers hope to strike some telling blows against these deadliest enemies in the coming decade. They do n't expect cures; instead, they look for new insights to help them attack the diseases from many directions Better understanding of cancer-causing genes and how to block them, for example, and of cancer-suppressing genes and how to harness them, would give medical scientists crucial new weapons to wield against cancer, which will kill an estimated 500,000 Americans this year. And new discoveries about the relationship of diet to heart disease might lead to innovative treatments for the nation's leading killer, cause of 767,000 American deaths in 1988, about one-third of the deaths from all causes Just about everybody has heard about eating right to avoid high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol can promote atherosclerosis, a narrowing of the arteries that sets the stage for heart attacks. But in the next decade, `` we may learn that what you eat is more important than just what it does to your cholesterol,'' said <PERSON> Rodman </PERSON> <PERSON> Starke </PERSON>, the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for scientific affairs. `` We are beginning to see glimmers of evidence'' that some dietary substances may affect atherosclerosis risk independently of any impact on cholesterol, he said. They may also promote blood clotting, which can cause heart attacks when it occurs in narrowed arteries that feed blood to the heart muscle, he said. Scientists may also find better ways to prevent heart attacks as they learn more details about what triggers them in people with atherosclerosis, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Willerson </PERSON>, chairman of the heart association's research committee. He also said researchers may find a way to identify people at risk for sudden cardiac death, a lethal disruption of the heart's pumping rhythm, and develop better techniques to prevent it Other potential developments <PERSON> Starke </PERSON> or <PERSON> Willerson </PERSON> suggested for the 1990s include: _ Greater understanding of the complex events that produce atherosclerosis, perhaps leading to treatments to reverse or avoid it _ Improved clot-dissolving drugs to stop heart attacks Researchers would like to reduce side effects, confine the anti-clotting effect to places where it will do good, and stop the effect of the drugs when needed to avoid risk of excessive bleeding. _ Better understanding and possible prevention of a re-narrowing of atherosclerotic arteries after a procedure called angioplasty is used to widen them This occurs in 25 percent to 40 percent of patients who go through angioplasty and is a major stumbling block to the procedure's success, <PERSON> Willerson </PERSON> said. As with heart disease, some of the advances experts hope for in the fight against cancer in the 1990s deal with prevention. Researchers may find genetic tests to identify people at high risk for cancer of the colon or breast, and probably some other common cancers as well, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON>, the cancer society's senior vice president for research Warnings and instructions about prevention should pack more wallop for those people than the blanket recommendations now given to everybody, he said. `` When you're talking about the possibility of changing your diet for your lifetime, it would be nice to know ahead of time whether it would be important for you to do that,'' <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> said. Another payoff in identifying people at particular risk for certain cancers would be the ability to learn more about effectiveness of preventive steps, said <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> director. If experiments can be focused on people at high risk, researchers can get better information on how much of a diet or lifestyle change is needed, and for how long, in order to cut cancer risk, said <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON>, who is physician-in-chief at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He and <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> also expect progress in making chemotherapy more effective by sabotaging the ability of some cancer cells to resist it. That could help treatment of many kinds of cancers, and particularly those of the breast, colon and pancreas, they said. Among the other possible developments in the 1990s suggested by <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> or Laszlo: _ The first experiments in people with `` anti-sense'' DNA, substances designed to block the effect of cancer-causing genes _ Routine use during chemotherapy of recently discovered colony-stimulating factors, allowing higher doses of medicine The substances counter a major side effect of chemotherapy, decreases in infection-fighting white blood cells. _ Advances in the use of monoclonal antibodies, molecules that can seek out and bind to cancer cells, to deliver radiation treatment or to keep cancer cells from responding to substances that spur their growth _ More research into suppressor genes, which act to prevent development of cancer Perhaps the substances they direct cells to make can be harnessed to fight cancer, <PERSON> DeVita </PERSON> said. `` Theoretically it should work, and technically there's no reason it ca n't be done,'' he said. `` So stay tuned.''

 When the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> 76ers play their first home game this season, <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> will be there, performing the national anthem. It's a tradition, and a logical one _ not just because the saxophonist lives in the suburb of <LOCATION> Germantown </LOCATION> or that former 76ers star <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Erving </PERSON> is a close friend. Musically, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says, it makes sense as well. That's right, jazz and basketball Riffs and dunks. Horn charts and game plans. He can hear it now, `` Starting at guard, please welcome, <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>'' `` We live really parallel lives,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, who even wrote a song about <PERSON> Erving </PERSON> called `` Let It Flow.'' `` We are trying to create, whether it's on the court or on the bandstand or the stage, the concept of team play _ whether you are on a basketball team or whether you are in a band. `` There are role players on a basketball team and role players in a band. Everybody shifts around, everybody gets to handle the ball, so to speak. My role is like the point guard. I try to give the ball to the people who can really do things with it. I'm also like a player-coach.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has provided valuable assists to collaborators <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and others. Singer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Withers </PERSON> got a boost in 1980 when the saxophonist phoned and urged him to add vocals to the track of `` Just the Two of Us,'' a No. 2 hit off the platinum `` Winelight'' album, winner of the `` Best Jazz Fusion Performance'' Grammy. On `` Time Out of My Mind,'' his 21st album, he offers encouragement to the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Antarctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expedition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Explorers </ORGANIZATION> with `` Protect the Dream.'' Sports crept in again as <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> explained why he was supporting those inspecting environmental conditions around the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION>. `` When I think of those guys on foot and on skis, going across <LOCATION> Antartica </LOCATION>, I realize all that is really for all of us,'' he said. `` They come back with information and the ball will be in our court. There are a lot of concerned people around that will take the advice and the facts they will be finding out.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sees his own work as information. Short stories without words. Impressions, often first impressions, turned into sound. The titles are a clue: `` Gramercy Park,'' a melodic <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride-Damon </PERSON> <PERSON> DueWhite </PERSON> composition about the historic section of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, or the romantic `` Unspoken Love,'' written by <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Veasley </PERSON>. The title track, a hit for <PERSON> Steely </PERSON> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, is a gesture of thanks to the jazz-rock group. `` Every time I get in my car and ride to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, its either ` Gaucho,' or ` Nightfly,''' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said of the Steely <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> record and group member <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagen </PERSON>'s solo album. `` Plus with that group, they've been some of the guys on the cutting edge of entertaining. ... They talk about religion, the Third World. They talk about glamour, how living hard will take its toll.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> likes a pace as relaxed as his own sweet saxophone. That means time with his wife, <PERSON> Christine </PERSON>, and children, <PERSON> Shana </PERSON> <PERSON> Bly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grover </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Jam sessions are balanced by parents' night at school. It makes for a richer life, and better records, he says. `` Through the things I do every day, I can relate in musical terms to my fans, let them know we have more similarities than differences. I am more than a one-dimensional person and the audience is more than a one-dimensional audience.'' He was born in 1943 in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and was playing sax by age 10. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s career took off in 1970 when he was featured on <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> `` Hammond'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s `` Breakout'' and arranged the cover of <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s `` It's too Late.'' His first solo record, the acclaimed `` Inner City Blues,'' came by accident when he wound up doing a solo intended for tenor saxophonist <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> who could n't make the studio date at the last minute. The title track is a cover of <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON>'s haunting meditation on urban life. Appropriate, since <PERSON> Gaye </PERSON>, and another personal favorite of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s, <PERSON> Stevie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonder </PERSON>, have often incorporated jazz into their own work. Jazz greats <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cannonball </PERSON> <PERSON> Adderley </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Coltrane </PERSON> are important influences. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also incorporates classical music and sounds from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But he thinks locally as well as globally. He does n't need to travel 5,000 miles for inspiration: Just walking down the street is enough. `` There's a record player playing in here all the time,'' he said, pointing to his head. `` I'm listening to everything. The screech of brakes. Three or four people walking and you can hear their heels clicking. Railroad tracks. `` Any kind of movement. Birds wings. There's a lot of things to be learned just by picking up on the subtle things that really present the whole musical picture.''

 Playfully and masterfully, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON> sedto the kitchen in the 1960s. Now, finally, she iuced <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ins back, seasoned oh so slightly by the health fanatics but as spicy and devoted to the joys of the table as ever. To much of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, she is the French chef they know and love, trilling `` bon appetit'' at the close of her landmark TV cooking lessons and willing to be a little like us by occasionally dropping a piece of chicken live on television and putting it back in the pan. `` Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' in two volumes, became manus cooks. And <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Child </PERSON> became etched in our datory for serioculture, her voice, her 6-foot-2 frame and her funny, charming presence. Even non-cooks know <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Aykroyd </PERSON>'s parody on `` Saturday Night Live'' -LRB- she found it `` terribly funny'' -RRB-. Now, at 77, she has published her seventh _ and, she says, last _ book, with the no-nonsense title `` The Way to Cook'' and a no-nonsense price of $ 50. With more than 800 recipes in 511 pages, it weighs in at a very serious 5 -LCB- pounds. It is the first cookbook chosen as a main selection by Book of the <ORGANIZATION> Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` I felt it was time for a new book and a new look,'' she said in a recent interview. `` ` Mastering' was very classical French, no deviating at all.'' `` The Way'' deviates, blending classic technique with free-style American cooking. Aimed at a generation for whom cooking may mean `` Lean Cuisine'' in the microwave, `` The Way to Cook'' includes such things as Chinese manicotti, which she calls an `` Italo-Sino conversation piece and unusually good eating.'' But this is by no means a new world of food. While there are plenty of low-fat recipes, there's no shortage of butter or cream. Or the egg, `` that perfect, pristine, primal object. We may not gobble it up as profusely now as we used to, but every mouthful should be memorable.'' And that is the essence of her attitude toward the fervor over healthy eating. Give up nothing. Eat with pleasure but in moderation. She bemoans the loss of `` those happy days in the'60s when everyone ate butter and cream. ... Oh, they were lovely days.'' Child says she has had to watch her weight for the last 35 years. `` I am very careful about my fat content and calories and eat much smaller portions. I am conscious of not wanting to be a Mrs. 6-by-6.'' But that does not mean a lack of good food or good company. `` The main thing is getting people together,'' said Child, who first learned to cook so she could feed her husband. `` I get very depressed when I do n't eat well _ and that does n't mean fancy.'' Americans' approach to food these days has her worried. `` What's dangerous and discouraging about this era is that people really are afraid of their food. Sitting down to dinner is a trap, not something to enjoy. People should take their food more seriously. Learn what you can eat and enjoy it thoroughly.'' In a discussion of the nutrients in vegetables, she writes of `` nervous nutritional nellies,'' who boil sprouts or green beans in a small covered pan rather than lots of water. The results, she writes, are `` invariably unappetizing, inedible and a dull gray-green. One reason, I am sure, that many people hate vegetables is because they're cooked like medicine. But fresh vegetables are glorious food.'' Child is foremost a teacher, though she says she would have been happy as a butcher and is proud of her puff pastry method and of the work she's done with poultry and bread. In `` The Way to <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>,'' published this month by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopf </PERSON>, Child teaches. The book is demanding but accessible, without recipes like the daunting 13 pages for French bread in the second volume of `` Mastering.'' The color photographs show the food as the cook sees it and there are plenty of them. Nine, for example, show step-by-step how to truss a chicken, and nine take the cook from a pile of butter and flour to puff pastry. `` It's really sort of a distillation of her whole career,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kump </PERSON> of <PERSON> Kump </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` She's expressing herself more clearly, more ably, in a way that I think is just superlative.'' And like a great teacher, Child anticipates questions. When she suggests creaming butter with a wooden spoon, she adds: `` You can use a hand-held mixer, but it's such a nuisance to scrape the butter out of the blades!'' Recipes are grouped unconventionally by technique, so, for example, pork and veal chops are together rather than pork chops and pork roast. The croutons for fish soups are with the soups, not the breads. There are master recipes and then variations. `` I want to encourage them to think of their own ways,'' Child said, and while she has little patience for fads -LRB- `` It's as though people did n't dare do anything traditional.'' -RRB-, the master recipe method allows for adding the trendy ingredient de jour. Modern appliances, like the food processor, are used, but Child has not been won over to the microwave oven, which she uses for defrosting, rewarming or starting dishes, but leaves her too little control over actual cooking. She does, however, suggest using a blowtorch. A blowtorch? `` A blowtorch is not just for laughs _ it is a legitimate kitchen tool, and marvelous for loosening aspics from their molds.'' She even suggests what kind to buy.

 Transplant surgeons expect to be able to replace almost every part of the human body during the 1990s, but they fear such medical feats will have little impact unless more people donate organs. `` I see another decade of progress equal to the last decade, but that wo n't happen until we figure out the organ donor problem a little bit better,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>'s Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Corry </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharing </ORGANIZATION>. Organ donation has been at a standstill the past few years, despite laws requiring hospitals to discuss the subject with relatives of brain-dead patients. `` One of the goals is that one of these days organ donation will be viewed as commonplace as giving blood,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheaffer </PERSON>, director of the federal Division of Organ Transplantation. `` Can we achieve that in the 1990s? I'm just not sure,'' she said. Doctors hope to ease the crunch in'90s by transplanting animal organs into humans. Such a cross-species transplant has not been attempted since 1984, when <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> surgeons put a baboon's heart into a 12-day-old girl. She died 20 days later. Advances also are expected in the quest for artificial organs, especially heart assist devices, that can be implanted permanently. Less flashy, but no less important, are efforts to attain long-term transplantation success without anti-rejection drugs that suppress the patient's entire immune system, and to extend the shelf life of donated organs. Doctors are working to perfect pancreas, lung, intestinal and reproductive organ transplants and to replace limbs with cadaver parts. About the only irreplaceable part seems to be the brain. `` It's a question of identity,'' said transplant pioneer Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you found a body for the brain, you'd transplant the body to the brain. It's a subtle distinction. I would n't have any plans for that.'' Whatever the advances, however, the donor flow may remain a problem. `` The whole thing would be revolutionized overnight if you could do something about that,'' <PERSON> Starzl </PERSON> said. `` When there's a crack in that wall, it's going to be like the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> pouring through.'' Studies show almost all Americans are aware of organ donation and view transplantation favorably. But only a slight majority express willingness to give loved ones' hearts, livers, kidneys and other vital parts so others may live. Fewer still want their own organs donated upon death. A record 18,500-plus people are awaiting organ transplants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the organ network. The list grows daily, as do the number of nagging questions concerning who gets what and who pays. `` In some respects, I think it's just as well there's a limited supply of donor organs,'' said <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, a senior research scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Battelle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you think of 1,647 hearts -LRB- transplanted in 1988 -RRB-, it really is not that big a deal,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` If we had more donor organs, it would ... raise more questions of how we can afford to offer this technology.''

 To his neighbors, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was a wealthy real estate developer who had it all, the son of a retired state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> chief justice, himself the patriarch of an elegant family, a loving father who took his son hunting. But inside, <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> was tortured by `` monsters,'' tormented by his business failures, shattered by the recent discovery that his son had epilepsy. Hopelessness overtook him and in the end he shot himself _ but not before taking the lives of his wife, son and daughter. The tragedy recalls other cases in which people bent on killing themselves have taken innocents, even bystanders, with them _ people like <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, the former mental patient who in September killed nine, including himself, in a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, printing plant rampage. Psychologists and physiologists are only beginning to isolate possible reasons for such perplexing behavior. Besides personal pressures that seem unbearable, they cite perverse love-hate relationships between some killers and victims, and in many cases a deficiency in a message-carrying chemical in the brain. The details of <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>'s final act provide a dim light down the foreboding tunnels of the mind. `` There was nothing strange about them,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Longley-Cook </PERSON>, a neighbor who was in a car pool with <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>, 44, was a patron of the arts and a caring mother so thoughtful she'd hand out trick-or-treat candy in advance of Halloween if she was going to be away. The daughter, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>, 21, graduated from college last spring with a degree in French and planned to spend some time in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, 17, was enrolled in a private school. `` It probably was the biggest shock of my life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Longley-Cook </PERSON> said of the July killings in the three-story brick house across the street. `` I do n't think we'll ever know what causes people to do things like that.'' <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>, a shy, private man of 47, had started seeing a psychiatrist about a month before. According to police reports, he indicated to the therapist that he was depressed because of, among other things, financial problems and the illness of his son, a loner who had few close friends. About a year earlier, the son suffered a seizure while driving, which led to the discovery he had epilepsy. The psychiatrist, who prescribed anti-depressant drugs for <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>, would not comment on the case, but police said he indicated <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> never talked about taking his own life, let alone killing his family. Just a week or two before the shootings, he told the therapist his difficulties seemed to be straightening out, according to investigators. But apparently pressure began to build in a mind psychiatrists say might have crossed the line from reality to exaggeration. His last thoughts were scribbled on a single page of paper in disjointed and unpunctuated notes: `` Depression `` Shaking uncontrollably inside `` Destitute `` No hope `` No hope for family `` No good insurance `` Epilepsy `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> is depressed from Tegretol -LRB- medication to control seizures -RRB- and ... walks the house at night as I do He worries about another seizure and accident, becoming a closeted person `` Death, nervous breakdown depression is everywhere `` The monster shakes my body each night and I wake trembling.'' The page ended with a reference to his wife, who was mourning the recent loss of her mother: `` No future, no hope, suffering for all of us _ she suffered in the past and ca n't suffer again.'' <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> also left an eight-page letter alleging payoffs and the mishandling of funds and grants in the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which makes loans for projects, including low-income housing for the poor. While <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> did not implicate himself, he alleged that the purported scheme to defraud the authority involved real estate he had owned. The state is investigating. <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> himself was facing a half-dozen civil suits filed by tenants of one of his developments seeking more than $ 2 million in damages from a fire. At a probate hearing, a judge said <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>'s estate might not be enough to cover his debts Dr. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>, a professor of psychology at <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>'s notes are an expression of tremendous anxiety, fear or threat he felt and an inability to separate himself from his family. Some suicidal people in a twisted state of mind may see those they murder as themselves. `` They are so fused, so incapable of distinguishing that this other person is a separate human being, the suicidal motive extends to having to kill this other person as well,'' said <PERSON> Berman </PERSON>. The most typical murder-suicide is one in which two partners depend on and abuse each other for affection in a love-hate relationship marked by separations, threats and accusations of infidelity, he said. `` They can not exist separate from each other and they really ca n't live with each other without being abusive. So it's sort of a final act that communicates just that and that is: ` I am so despairing because you're threatening to leave me. I hate you so much and I love you so much, I have to take you with me and I have to go.''' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> told of a <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> man who shot his lover three times in the head, then bent over and kissed her before killing himself. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> counselor, found in a study of 104 murder-suicides that 71 percent of the murderers were husbands or boyfriends of the victims. In half of the cases, the couple had been drinking. Studies since 1976 link such violent and impulsive behavior to a decrease in the chemical called serotonin, which carries messages between brain cells. `` Serotonin has been found to be the lowest in murder-suicides,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>, a psychiatrist and chief of the Behavioral Medicine Program at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. `` It's also very low in arsonists who then kill themselves or attempt suicide.'' Some who commit murder-suicide fall victim to depression or psychosis, unable to distinguish reality from fantasy, hearing voices telling them to hurt themselves and others. They blame others including family members or their work supervisors for their failures and their hurt, often exaggerated in the exhaustion of the mind. `` These are people ... who feel helpless in the face of being victimized by someone else,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ebert </PERSON>, senior forensic psychologist at <LOCATION> McLean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Belmont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.

 Such was the case with <PERSON> Wesbecker </PERSON>, a 47-year-old pressman who was put on disability leave last year. A manic depressive, he had attempted suicide three times. Co-workers said he carried a grudge because he was laid off and feared his disability benefits were going to be stopped. `` You're dealing with a man who perceives a miscarriage of justice and he's going to correct it,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Symonds </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Victimization.

The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said that in over 90 percent of suicides there is some humiliating life event in the recent past. `` There's a breakup in a relationship. They've lost a job They've lost some financial status. They're about to be confronted by the law.'' No one knows for sure what was going through <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON>'s mind that fatal summer day on <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think everybody wishes they knew because you could say, ` Well, it happened because of this and we can put it behind us,''' said Mrs. <PERSON> Longley-Cook </PERSON>, a mother of three. `` I think that's what's very frightening to chldren. They see this happy family across the street and then suddenly they hear the father murdered everyone and killed himself. That's pretty devastating for children. Every time I see the house, I just ca n't believe that's happened there.

<HEAD>The Enigmatic Pynchon To Publish `Vineland'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Rumor has it <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> is back in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> again preparing to publish a new book, unless the tales about him tracing the Mason-Dixon Line or hiding out in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are to be believed. Most of what's known about the elusive, award-winning author of `` V.'' and `` The Crying of Lot 49'' is learned through rumor. He has n't published a novel in nearly 17 years, yet some academics and hardcore admirers still rank him among the greatest American novelists of the 20th century, if only for his 1973 epic `` Gravity's Rainbow.'' In a day of so many ephemeral authors, <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> remains relatively unknown, virtually unphotographed and as mystifying a character as any he's created. `` Simply put, <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> has a status in American writing that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Faulkner </PERSON> had in the early part of the century,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON>, a professor of comparative literature at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` There seems to be a book that every age or generation develops to understand its own world. ` Gravity's Rainbow,' more than any other, is the book post-war <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can use to understand how it got to be the way it is.'' <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> has shunned the public eye since `` V.'' was published in 1963, saying, `` What's important is what's on the page.'' When he won the National Book Award in 1973, he sent a comedian, Professor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Corey </PERSON>, to accept it for him. He was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1988, but the foundation had trouble figuring out where to send the check. A portrait of <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> emerges from conversations with several friends on whom he has relied for decades yet has n't contacted in five or six years. Most of them spoke on the condition that their names not be used. The 52-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate appears to have virtually disappeared into the fabric of society, moving almost free of its burdens, with few possessions and never taking a wife or a job, much as Lt. <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Slothrop </PERSON> literally disappears at the close of `` Gravity's Rainbow.'' But unlike the elusive writer <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salinger </PERSON>, who withdrew into rural <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> once he became famous, <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> need not worry about being recognized; only a handful of people know what he looks like. `` It is n't something that came to him because he got famous. He was that way before, and why I do n't quite know,'' said <PERSON> Corlies </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was instrumental in publishing one of <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON>'s first stories in the early 1960s. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> edited `` V.'' and `` Gravity's Rainbow,'' but in his 30-year association with the author, he's seen <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> only four or five times. `` He does not wish to be written about,'' one friend said. `` He wanted to be known for the writing and not for the story about him.'' `` Gravity's Rainbow'' has become a benchmark that many post-World War II American novels are measured against. The story is a dizzyingly entertaining tale of <PERSON> Slothrop </PERSON>'s departure from World War II <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and his adventures wandering through demilitarized <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> searching, in part, for information on the German V-2 rockets. But the novel also deals with man's use of metaphor to organize his world and through the arc metaphor that permeates the book as it examines history. `` A lot of the metaphor is concerned with Christmas and Advent and -LRB- that -RRB- seems to equate the rise of history with an upward arc to the birth of Christ,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fix </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a transformation there; history is desanctified and replaced by technology. The other side of the arc ... is gravity's rainbow.'' But far from the stodgy style one might expect from such an endeavor, <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON>'s prose is colored with surrealistic overtones and the characters often burst into song, like a 1930s musical. There is a `` pure goofiness that's matched with this high rhetorical voice. He can change gears with you on a moments notice without that ever feeling false,'' Fix said. Equally intriguing is <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON>'s research into the workings of the V-2s and such arcane topics as international corporate alliances that pre-dated the war. Past associates said his attention to detail led him to travel the Mason-Dixon Line in the early 1980s, gathering information for a book on the 18th century English astronomers <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeremiah </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>. `` Opera librettos, movies and television drama are allowed to get away with all kinds of errors in detail,'' <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON> wrote in the introduction to `` Slow Learner,'' a collection of his early short stories published in 1984. `` Too much time in front of the Tube and a writer can get to believing the same thing about fiction. Not so. Though it may not be wrong absolutely to make up, as I still do, what I do n't know or am too lazy to find out, phony data are more often than not deployed in places sensitive enough to make a difference, thereby losing what marginal charm they may have possessed outside the story's context.'' The new novel, `` <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION>,'' to be published by <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in February, is a shorter, straightforward story set in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> about characters who try to reconcile coming of age in the'60s with life in the 1980s, according to its editor, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> does n't like to discuss the book and he refuses to talk about his meetings and work with the author. Publicity material for `` Vineland'' reads: `` It is 1984, and <PERSON> Frenesi </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>' job as an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sting specialist has just been cut from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> budget. Out in the cold now, she may also have become a target for her ex-lover, federal prosecutor <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Vond </PERSON>, who has come storming into northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> at the head of a heavily armed strike force.'' Gates' old <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> chums are beginning to vanish, and the daughter she walked out on 15 years ago comes looking for her. `` Combining elements of a daytime drama and the political thriller, <LOCATION> Vineland </LOCATION> also marks <PERSON> Pynchon </PERSON>'s return to the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> dreamscape he last explored in ` The Crying of Lot 49,''' according to the catalog copy.

<HEAD>Ecologists Despair of Global Warming; Scientists Less Sure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Worrying about the threat of global warming has become a major preoccupation among environmental groups and think tanks, but in the scientific community not everyone is quite so willing to run for cover. The `` greenhouse effect'' is threatening to raise temperatures, melt the polar ice caps, change climate and generally disrupt civilization, say those concerned about the hazard. But others point out that just a decade or so ago, similar warnings were being issued that the world was headed into another ice age. Many weather researchers hesitate to pronounce any conclusion on global warming, pointing out that too little is known about the threat to make a judgment. In an effort to sort out the problem, a coalition of government agencies has launched a research effort that could extend over several years. Among those taking part are the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the Geological Survey, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the Council on Environmental Quality, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. While the theory behind the greenhouse effect seems pretty simple, it's like a lot of other theories _ the reality is more complicated than the hypothesis. The theory goes like this: Industrial processes over the last century have spilled a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Although carbon dioxide is colorless, odorless and essentially harmless by itself, it slows the passage of heat. Having extra carbon dioxide in the air means light can come in and warm the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, but heat ca n't go back out as easily as it once did. Thus, the theory is that the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> should warm up because of the extra carbon dioxide. It's called the greenhouse effect because of the trapping of heat by the atmosphere, somewhat like the trapping of warmth by greenhouse glass. Recent warm summers increased concern about this possibility, and some eminent scientists have raised the possibility of a hazardous overheating. These include G.O.P. <PERSON> Obasi </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. A spate of worrisome reports, studies, analyses and recommendations has come from such wide-ranging groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mechanical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> and Zero Population Growth. Yet, voices are increasingly being heard on the other side of the issue, especially in light of reports seeming to show a reduced threat. `` It's obvious that the most recent scientific results are drastically cutting the estimates of global warming,'' climatologist <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> said in a telephone interview. `` The more realistic climate models have more than halved the estimates of prospective warming, and when compared to observed temperatures it still appears that these may be overestimates,'' <PERSON> Michaels </PERSON> said. `` It's intriguing to me that people with interventionist points of view tend to neglect the most sophisticated scientific findings,'' he concluded. The effect of clouds on the warning threat has been a major factor in recent studies. Computer models of the climate have been the source of many of the concerns about the warming but many models have little ability to include clouds. Indeed, until recently opinions were mixed over whether clouds would cool the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> or add to the heating. But new studies have found that, overall, clouds have a cooling effect by blocking incoming sunlight. How much cooling will result remains to be seen. Some scientists say the clouds could cut the threatened warming in half. And if warming does occur it could result in more evaporation of water, making more clouds, so a new balance could be reached with only little global warming. Computer models trying to find this balance disagree with one another, however, leaving many scientists unwilling to recommend anything beyond more research. They warn that a few hot years do n't make a trend, just as the hot summers in the 1930s did n't mean global warming was imminent and the cooling trend from 1940 to 1980 did n't mean another ice age. Some climate warming reported over the last century could have resulted from changes in the brightness of the sun, commented <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>. `` Forecasters can not rely on the temperature increase observed in the last 100 years as an indicator of greenhouse warming in the next century,'' said <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>. Other studies have indicated that reports of increases in average temperature over the last 100 years may even be exaggerated. National Climatic Data Center studies found that in many cases temperature records are kept in cities that have recorded rising temperature as they grew larger and more crowded. `` We are confronted with an inverted pyramid of knowledge; a huge and growing mass of proposals for policy action is balanced on a handful of real facts,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> of the National Academy of Engineering. Writing in the September issue of the Bulletin of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, he asked: `` Can we arrest or slow the processes that increase the concentrations of greenhouse gases? The answer is yes. But we have no grasp on the social and economic ramifications of intervention.'' Nonetheless, many environmentalists continue to advocate action on the theory that by the time science can give conclusive answers it may be too late to slow the warming trend. `` Clearly, society does not have the resources to hedge against all possible negative future outcomes,'' concedes <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> at the atmospheric research center. But, he says, while research continues `` society should pursue those actions that provide widely agreed social benefits even if the predicted change does not materialize.'' Prime among those suggestions is improved energy efficiency that reduces release of carbon dioxide and also cuts down on energy costs and air pollution. Other steps would include developing alternative technologies and testing new crop strains. Waiting for scientific consensus, he contends, could allow the warming to speed up out of control, forcing society to face an even larger and faster growing problem than is already feared.

<HEAD>Army Says Beretta USA In Default of Pistol Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ACCOKEEK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claims <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> is not living up to its part of what has been called `` the pistol contract of the century,'' according to a published report. In a terse `` show cause'' notice Aug. 2, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> warned it could cancel the contract with the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> arms maker, its sole supplier of sidearms, because of production problems at Beretta's southern <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> plant, The -LRB- <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> -RRB- Sun reported Monday `` ... Since you have failed to perform under the terms of -LRB- the -RRB- contract within the time required by its terms, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government is considering terminating the contract ... for default,'' the notice said. In June, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> rejected a production lot of M9 9mm semiautomatic pistols produced by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary of the Italian arms maker <ORGANIZATION> Beretta </ORGANIZATION>, causing the company to fall behind its production schedule, Maj. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said last week. As of Oct. 1, <PERSON> Beretta </PERSON> had failed to deliver a total of 8,400 guns, <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said. Under the terms of the contract, the company is required to deliver 6,000 guns a month, he said. `` Pending a final decision in this matter, it will be necessary to determine whether your failure to perform arose from causes beyond your control and without fault or negligence on your part,'' the notice to the company said. `` Your failure to present any excuses ... may be considered as an admission that none exist.'' <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> does not plan to cancel the contract, but wants an explanation for the delay. A response was received from the company, but it was unsatisfactory, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> decided in 1980 to replace the Colt 45 and other handguns with a standard 9mm pistol. The award to <LOCATION> Beretta </LOCATION> has been called `` the pistol contract of the century'' by some. Others, including some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, objected to the selection of a foreign company for the contract. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Reh </PERSON>, Beretta's contract officer, said the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s show-cause notice prevented the firm from discussing contractual issues at length `` We consider the shortage to be due to relatively minor testing difficulties,'' <PERSON> Reh </PERSON> said. `` One of them has been resolved, and we're working to resolve the others.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said it rejected the lot in June because of possible defects. <PERSON> Reh </PERSON> said the rejection was precautionary. `` The problems were n't discovered in the field: this came up in pre-shipment testing,'' <PERSON> Reh </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which buys the 9mm pistols for all military services, refused a lot of 500 guns because a sample weapon was found to have possible hairline cracks in its frame, <PERSON> Bomier </PERSON> said. Past problems with cracked frames forced the Army to reject a total for 12,000 handguns from lots in December 1987 and January 1988. The previous rejections prompted the company to redesign the M9 pistol frame. A more serious defect that caused four injuries last year prompted another design modification.

The association said that unlike <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>'s single independent TV station, WUHF-TV, channel 31, the cable system could drop or change the channel location of competing local broadcast stations, control programming and sell and package advertising on numerous channels, and control the type, source and channel position of competing program services. <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION>, which has 163,000 subscribers, is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> WGRC </ORGANIZATION>'s general manager, said he could not comment until he had read the association's filing The association said the relationship between the cable system and <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION>, a major producer of cable and broadcast TV programs, could give WGRC-TV an advantage in purchasing programs and could allow the cable system to discriminate against competitors. `` The ability the system has to exploit is position ... is of great concern,'' the association's attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Popham </PERSON>, told a news conference. He said the Time-Warner-WGRC link, known as vertical integration, `` per se was not a problem,'' but that the `` potential for abuses'' was. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedlund </PERSON>, the association's vice president for government relations, said there was nothing inherently bad with cable operators programming on one channel. But it becomes a problem when a cable system is the sole provider, in most cases, of cable service to a community and when it can control both the delivery and the content of its programs. The association said <ORGANIZATION> WGRC </ORGANIZATION> had hired former TV executives and a sales staff at the station and is running onetime network programs, such as `` Quincy,'' `` Knight Rider'' and `` The A-Team,'' as an independent broadcast station would. The station, which began operation last month, also has purchased `` ALF'' and `` Perfect Strangers,'' as well as first-run syndication shows such as `` Divorce Court'' and movie packages, according to the Sept. 18 issue of the television industry publication <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION>. `` WGRC is sort of a next generation,'' <PERSON> Hedlund </PERSON> said. `` This is a situation we're trying to jump on before it becomes widespread.'' The association asked the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> to initiate proceedings looking towards adopting rules to `` preserve fair economic competition and a diversity of program sources in light of the increasing incentives for and actual occurences of anti-competitive behavior in the cable television industry.''

<HEAD>To Rename Broker-Dealer Subsidiary To Prevent Sales Force Exodus</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The struggling investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it will transfer its main broker-dealer subsidiary to two executives and change the division's name in an attempt to stanch a sales force exodus. Integrated, which has $ 1.75 billion in debt, said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would be renamed <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and its stock transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> executives <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krat </PERSON>. The change is directed at retaining credibility for Integrated's 3,900 registered broker-dealers who sell products ranging from mutual funds to investment partnerships to stocks and bonds, <PERSON> Krat </PERSON> said in an interview `` Right now now it's fair to say if you're affiliated with the name Integrated Resources you have a problem,'' he said. Integrated in June defaulted on nearly $ 1 billion of its total debt of about $ 1.75 billion. Since then the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> company has sought to sell its key financial assets, including <ORGANIZATION> IREC </ORGANIZATION>, in an attempt to raise money to pay what it owes. The sales force has shrunk from about 4,600 in June, when Integrated's financial troubles became public, and the company wanted to prevent further defections. `` There has been a substantial decline over these many months in the amount of Integrated product sales they've been making as there has been growing resistance to the Integrated name,'' <PERSON> Krat </PERSON> said, but did not specify the decline. While the sales force still would sell Integrated products, <PERSON> Krat </PERSON> said broker-dealers under a new name `` do n't have that first hurdle to overcome.'' Under the agreement, IREC sales personnel, who are independent contractors licensed with the subsidiary, would be offered the opportunity to be licensed with the new broker-dealer. <PERSON> Lavin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Krat </PERSON> were the principal managers of the subsidiary, based in <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Krat </PERSON> said the deal, which requires the approval of Integrated's board, should be completed by year's end. <ORGANIZATION> IREC </ORGANIZATION> was the company's key financial subsidiary, but it's paper worth was minimal because the sales force was independent. The company said it would retain the right to repurchase the stock of <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> if it arranges a sale of the subsidiary. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> IREC </ORGANIZATION>, Integrated wants to sell <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment adviser; and two of its life insurance companies, <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Integrated has not paid any principle or interest to bondholders since June. The company's woes stem from difficulties diversifying out of real estate into financial services.

 The dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen in slow trading today, while prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> declined moderately after a five-day gain. The dollar closed at 142.10 yen, down 0.30 yen from Monday's close It opened at 141.80 yen and ranged between 141.72 yen and 142.25 yen. Volume totaled $ 5.644 billion, compared with $ 4.534 billion Monday.

<HEAD>GM Using Holograms in Battle Against Counterfeit Parts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has copied a technique used by credit card companies in the automaker's battle to keep counterfeit parts out of the market. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is stamping holograms, which are made by laser beams, on packages of brake pads and electronic ignitions for export. The difficult-to-duplicate etchings have the superimposed words `` <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` GM'' and `` Genuine'' in a small rectangle on the outside of the package. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have spent millions of dollars during the past several years to find and eliminate counterfeit parts makers. `` Some of these -LRB- fake -RRB- packages are so good that even we ca n't tell if they're counterfeit,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> security Besides draining an automaker's balance sheet, a counterfeit part may not have the same quality as the real thing, and that can lead to unanticipated problems, including lawsuits. For example, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> school district sued <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> after transmissions in its buses failed. The district bought what it thought was <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> transmission fluid which, it contended, led to the failures. Tests showed the fluid was a mixture of cheap oil and red dye, and the automaker was dropped from the suit. The fluid maker's operations were raided by federal marshals <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> declined to say how much <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has lost because of counterfeit parts, but said that the <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> had the largest concentration of bogus parts. There, he estimated, about 40 percent of all parts labeled as <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> actually are fakes. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> officials also declined to say how much their companies may have lost to parts counterfeiters, but said raids at warehouses have turned up millions of dollars worth of fake components. Many of the fake parts are made and marketed overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has less of a problem since its parts are available only through the company's dealerships.

 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors has decided to keep the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> independent for now as it examines alternatives to a $ 6.75 billion buyout that collapsed earlier this month. The $ 300-a-share bid from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s management, pilots and <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> could n't generate enough bank financing, and its failure helped trigger a Friday the 13th plunge in the stock market. Last week <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock lost $ 111.25 a share. It closed up $ 10 a share on Monday at $ 178.37 -LCB- on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s opening was delayed today due to an order imbalance, with indications that it could open anywhere from $ 143 to $ 153 a share. The board's announcement Monday was vaguely and carefully worded, leaving <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s precise plans unclear. It said it considered the failed bid's price of $ 300 a share to be `` an attractive offer'' and `` in the best interests of shareholders.'' `` Consistent with the effort to maximize shareholder value, the board will continue to explore all strategic and financial alternatives available to the company,'' the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> statement said. But it did not mention any specific alternatives, including an informal proposal from <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s management and pilots unit reportedly valued at between $ 225 and $ 240 a share, or as much as $ 5.42 billion. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots said they were disappointed with <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to continue negotiating a possible takeover of the airline. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON>, head of the pilots' group, said the union `` was prepared to work with the board to shape a transaction that would provide <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stockholders with value significantly in excess of the current market price of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> stock.'' Analysts had linked the surge in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock Monday to a <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> report saying the labor-managment group was considering a revised offer that would give employees a majority stake in the company and leave some stock in public hands. But a separate statement from <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> on Monday indicated an acquisition effort was over. <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> said the cooperative buyout effort had helped management and the pilots to forge a `` substantially improved working relationship.'' He said he `` hopes that all 70,000 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> employees can now turn their full attention to operating the best airline in the world.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s statement indicates <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board wants management to return its attention to running <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` What this kind of does, it gives them a little breathing room,'' <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> said.

 The stock market retreated again early today amid concerns about sluggish corporate profits and the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buyout. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 20.29 points to 2,642.62 in the first half-hour of trading. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones more than 2 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 316 higher, 651 lower and 507 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 27.92 million shares as of 10 a.m. EDT. The government's report of a slight decline in factory orders did nothing to dispel concerns that corporate profits for the third quarter were lower than expected. Orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods, held back by slumping demand in the transportation category, slipped 0.1 percent in September, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Analysts said that both the August and September orders reports were skewed by a big swing in demand for automobiles, which had surged in August only to drop back to a more normal level in September. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s opening on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> was delayed due to an excess of sell orders over buy orders, with indications that it could open 20 to 30 a share below Monday's close of 178 -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors said late Monday it has decided to keep the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> independent for now as it examines alternatives to a $ 300-a-share buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month. Among other active issues in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> were <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>, down -LCB- at 22 |; McDonald's, down -RRB- at 31, and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, down -LRB- at 43 -RCB- The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks was off 1.08 points at 189.82.

<HEAD>Prime Says It Will Lay Off 2,500</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Prime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will lay off 2,500 employees, nearly 20 percent of its work force, as part of a restructuring after its billion-dollar buyout by J.H. <ORGANIZATION> Whitney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the company said. The layoffs announced Monday will be spread over several months and will mostly affect Prime's employees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The minicomputer company, which is based in <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, will be divided into four departments designed to focus on particular customer services, said Prime spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON>. More money will be spent on those that do well. `` If there is a product for which there is not a strong market, the spending on those products will be reduced or eliminated,'' <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> said. The company's new strategy was part of a plan to reduce the $ 1 billion debt it took on after <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm, bought the company in August and ended Prime's 10-month battle against hostile bidder <ORGANIZATION> MAI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tustin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> paid $ 20 a share for 49.5 million Prime shares and exchange notes with a face value of $ 22 per share for the remaining 21 percent of Prime's shares Much of the deal, which analysts estimated was worth between $ 1.06 billion and $ 1.16 billion, was financed by debt, said <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON> said the exact figure for Prime's debt would not be available until a special board meeting, when the final details of the <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> merger were to be completed. The meeting has not yet been scheduled, he said. Officials at Prime, which also announced Monday the introduction of two new software products for computer-aided design, declined to offer projections for Prime's revenue for the past year. The firm, whose revenue comes about equally from its ventures in minicomputers, computer-aided design systems and customer service, did not issue a third-quarter report. The company turned a profit of $ 19 million on sales of $ 1.6 billion in 1988. That year the firm posted a one-time loss of $ 58 million based on costs involved in a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Computervision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gavaghan </PERSON>. The cost of defending against MAI Basic Four and slow sales of minicomputers led to losses of $ 14.4 million in the final quarter of 1988, $ 5 million in the first quarter of 1989 and $ 19 million in the second quarter. Prime said it has established a career counseling and training center at its <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION> headquarters to help those employees let go.

<HEAD>Bond Corp. Says Debt Totals 6.9 Billion Australian Dollars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s debt totals 6.9 billion Australian dollars, with rising Australian interest rates and the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> acquisition the chief causes, Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> disclosed Tuesday The disclosure followed Friday's news that <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had incurred the largest annual loss in Australian corporate history. In its fiscal year ended June 30, <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> lost 980.2 million Australian dollars, the equivalent of about $ 762.4 million. Much of the loss was due to one-time write-downs of the value of some of <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s assets. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, chairman and controlling shareholder of the cash-strapped <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> media, brewing, natural resources and property concern, provided the debt figures at a business gathering. He said the debt load would have been heavier if not for a reduction of 5 billion Australian dollars over the past year from asset sales. Bond indicated that detailed debt numbers, which would include liabilities of units such as the <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, would be published soon in <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s annual report. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> predicted that the debt would be lightened by an additional 3.8 billion Australian dollars this year, ending June 30, 1990, but he did n't explain how the reduction would be achieved. Rising Australian interest rates and the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> `` with its very high levels of short-term debt'' were blamed by <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> for creating a condition `` that was no longer sustainable.'' `` In order to restore confidence and ensure the support of our principal lenders, we embarked on fundamental changes in the structure and direction of the group,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. That realignment resulted in continuing asset sales, as well as write-offs exceeding 1.1 billon Australian dollars in the past financial year. `` In essence we have made a decision to clear the decks,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> told the meeting. While some assets have been written down, others are undervalued on <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s books, <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> maintained. Among the undervalued holdings are the company's Australian brewing assets, which <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said are actually worth 2.5 billion Australian dollars while being on the books as being worth 950 million Australian dollars. An investment in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s telephone company is carried at $ 300 million, but really should be valued at $ 500 million, according to <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>. Also, the company's property portfolio is undervalued by at least 250 million Australian dollars, he said. Bond forecast that by next June, `` What will emerge will be a company with a honed sense of purpose ... a stable balance sheet, with good quality assets in brewing, telecommunications, media and property.'' He did n't mention energy resources on that list, possibly signalling that all the company's coal and oil interests might be for sale. Some oil holdings already have been sold. <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s annual loss compared with a profit of 273.5 million Australian dollars a year earlier. Operating revenue in fiscal 1989 rose 69 percent to 8.48 billion Australian dollars from 5.01 billion Australian dollars. But after-tax interest costs jumped 85 percent to 686.7 million Australian dollars from 371.1 million Australian dollars. In commenting last week on its results, <ORGANIZATION> Bond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the financial performance of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brewing operations, <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heileman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, was `` disappointing, and this has been reflected in the results.''

 A plunge in stock prices this morning sent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 stock-index futures down the 12-point limit permitted under `` circuit-breaker'' rules designed to slow a market collapse.

The contract is valued at $ 500 a point. The 12-point drop tripped a circuit-breaker rule prohibiting selling at prices below that level for 30 minutes. The decline occurred as the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> tumbled more than 80 points before recovering some lost ground.

 Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading this morning before regaining some lost ground amid concerns about the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buyout. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 32.38 points to 2,630.53 in the first 90 minutes of trading. The Dow had fallen as much as 85 points in early trading before rebounding. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by more than 8 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 149 higher, 1,253 lower and 327 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 100.98 million shares as of 11 a.m. EDT. `` <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> revisted,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The failure of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> to continue moving forward on the buyout has raised havoc with the transportation sector.'' <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors said late Monday it has decided to keep the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> independent for now as it examines alternatives to a $ 300-a-share employee-management buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month. The announcement that the group was unable to get financing for the deal helped trigger a 190.58-point drop in the Dow industrials on Oct. 13. The market bounced back last week, gaining a record 119.88 points total, but the Dow average slipped back by 26.23 on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> plunged 30 -RRB- to 148 in early trading. The stock's opening on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> was delayed due to an excess of sell orders over buy orders. Analysts said the news that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would remain independent affected other transportation stocks and generally triggered the morning selloff. Computerized program trading also contributed to the decline.

 Shares in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s Disney theme park rocketed 18 percent higher on Tuesday when <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> allowed gray market trading to begin officially because of heavy interest in the new issue. The shares were quoted at the equivalent of $ 13.36, up $ 2.05 from the offer price of $ 11.31. They were up $ 2.88 at one point as investors scrambled to take a stake in the theme park to be built in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Demand for the shares outstripped supply almost five times when applications closed on Friday and a ballot was being held to divide the allocation, the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> said. Gray market trading, which takes place among investors before full trading begins through the stock exchange, is the trading of promises to buy and sell shares once full trading starts. The market is called gray because the activity is not illegal as in a black market, yet it is not full trading, either. The sale of Euro Disneyland shares in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was part of a public offering across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Euro <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SCA </ORGANIZATION>, the French company building the park, is selling 85.9 million shares for about $ 1 billion in the 12 Common Market countries to help finance the $ 7.5 billion project. Euro Disneyland shares were scheduled to start trading officially in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> from Nov. 6. A gray market in Euro <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> shares has existed in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> since the offer price was declared on Oct. 5.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the holding company for the nation's seventh-largest airline, reported a net loss of $ 77.7 million for the third quarter, which it attributed to flat demand and higher operating expenses. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it lost $ 77.7 million, or $ 1.86 a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a net profit of $ 68.5 million, or $ 1.58 a share, in the third quarter of 1988. Third-quarter revenue was unchanged at $ 1.5 billion. `` Domestic airline industry traffic growth was flat during 1989 compared to 1988, and domestic industry revenue per passenger mile for the third quarter of 1989 was only 1.4 percent above the comparable period in 1988,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and President <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colodny </PERSON>. Earnings also were affected by the airline's Kids Fly Free program, lower fares in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and frequent flir awards, <PERSON> Colodny </PERSON> said. The company, which absorbed <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> into its system in early August, also reported higher labor and fuel costs as well as one-time costs stemming from the merger. The effects of Hurricane Hugo, which disrupted <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>'s major hub at <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and other southeastern cities, can not be quantified, the company said. However, it said, the effects of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> and the recent <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> earthquake, combined with recent trends `` are expected to cause operating results for the fourth quarter and for 1989 to be significantly lower than those of the comparable 1988 periods.'' For the first nine months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 38.5 million, or 76 cents a share, on revenue of $ 4.8 billion. That compares with net income of $ 142.2 million, or $ 3.28 a share, on revenue of $ 4.2 billion for the same period last year.

 Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading this morning before regaining some lost ground amid concerns about the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buyout. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 49.80 points to 2,613.11 in the first 90 minutes of trading. The Dow had fallen as much as 85 points in early trading before rebounding.

 <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Monday reported third-quarter net income of $ 155 million, up 6 percent from $ 146 million in the same quarter last year. Earnings per share for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $ 1.41, vs. $ 1.37 for the same period a year ago. Combined revenues totaled $ 4.4 billion, an increase of 7 percent from $ 4.1 billion in the third quarter of 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> reported increases in net income in both financial services and business products and systems. Net income for financial services increased by 1 percent, with growth in financing operations and strong capital gains offsetting the cost of strengthening reserves and the impact of Hurricane Hugo, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearns </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer.

<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday credited extensive restructuring earlier in the year for a third-quarter profit of $ 9.8 million, which contrasted with a $ 2.4 million loss in the same period a year earlier. The computer company also reported earnings per share of 23 cents for the 1989 third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss per share of 6 cents for the same quarter a year ago. Revenues of $ 763 million for the 1989 quarter were down 9 percent from $ 841.4 million a year ago. <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> said the quarterly results were helped by the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Imprimis </ORGANIZATION>, the disk drive subsidiary, to <ORGANIZATION> Seagate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>. Pre-tax earnings of $ 16.2 million include an $ 8.5 million gain from restructuring, which was made up of a $ 33.7 million gain from asset sales, including <ORGANIZATION> Imprimis </ORGANIZATION>, offset by charges of $ 25.2 million. For the first nine months of this year, the company reported a loss of $ 484 million, or a per-share loss of $ 11.51, compared with earnings of $ 14.5 million, or 34 cents a share, for the 1988 period. Revenues were $ 2.41 billion, compared with $ 2.7 billion a year ago. The company lost $ 497.3 million in the second quarter, mainly as a result of shutting down the <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer subsidiary and cutting 3,100 jobs. Closing the St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, Minn.-based <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> cost <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> around $ 335 million. The balance of the charges came from shrinking the Cyber mainframe division, paying severance to cover corporate staff layoffs and the company's departure from the training and education business. `` The improved results the company achieved in the third quarter are gratifying and stems from the actions taken during the past several months,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. `` While the results represent only a modest return to positive momentum, the company can now build on that momentum.'' Every business group except the semiconductor subsidiary was profitable before interest and taxes in the third quarter, the company said.

<HEAD>Texaco's Profit Rose 11 Percent In Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said today its earnings rose 11 percent in the third quarter, helped by substantially higher results in the company's exploration and production business. For the three months ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 305 million, or $ 1.10 a share, compared with $ 274 million, or $ 1.12 a share, a year earlier. Revenue dipped 4 percent to $ 8.36 billion from $ 8.68 billion, the result of the company's recent asset restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> said the lower per-share earnings in the third quarter reflected a higher number of outstanding shares of common stock as well as a new preferred stock for which the company must set aside reserves. In the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings more than doubled to $ 2.13 billion, or $ 8.19 a share, from $ 1.01 billion, or $ 4.14, a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue was down slightly at $ 26.42 billion from $ 26.67 billion. Nine-month earnings benefited from a gain of $ 1.2 billion, or $ 4.87 a share, from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in the first quarter. The sale was part of a massive restructuring involving the sale of some $ 7 billion in assets. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> completed the asset-sale portion of the restructuring earlier this year, nearly a year after emerging from bankruptcy protection. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 to avoid having to post a potentially damaging multibillion-dollar security bond in its fight with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> had sued claiming <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>'s prior contract to buy part of <LOCATION> Getty </LOCATION> A <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> a $ 10.3 billion judgment. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> appealed but eventually settled with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> last week announced its first major acquisition since the restructuring _ a $ 476.5 million purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Tana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Production </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Corpus Christi-Texas-based subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> TRT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with large natural gas and oil properties. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, president of the nation's third-largest oil concern behind <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> in the third period completed the distribution to shareholders of a portion of the proceeds from the restructuring. It also initiated a stock buyback plan under which the company proposes to repurchase, `` subject to market conditions,'' $ 500 million of its common stock by August 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> also retired approximately $ 1 billion of debt, <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said. Higher crude oil prices during the third period boosted <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s exploration and production earnings substantially from $ 68 million in the 1988 period to $ 185 million in the latest quarter The company's chemical's business also showed strong gains _ $ 68 million vs. $ 45 million a year earlier. Lower gasoline prices and higher crude costs, however, hurt <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s refining and marketing business during the period. Earnings in that sector were cut in half to $ 180 million from $ 373 million in the third quarter of 1988.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> might try to buy <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> outright when British government restrictions on investors' shares in the luxury automaker expire at the end of 1990, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automaker said Tuesday. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was continuing to build its stake in the British luxury carmaker and had boosted its holdings to 12 percent from 10.4 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> filed documents Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> declaring that it might bid for all of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, spokeswoman <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> said. Whether a bid would in fact be made was not immediately known. `` It is n't saying we will do it, and it is n't saying we wo n't,'' <PERSON> Cummins </PERSON> said. Under British regulations, no investor can acquire more than 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> until the end of 1990. The British government imposed that restriction when it privatized <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> regulations require a company to state its intentions when it acquires 5 percent or more of another company, and that led to Monday's filing by <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> has said it wants to remain independent. The latest stock purchase coincided with talks between <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on an operating agreement that is expected to include a commitment from <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> to take a small equity stake in <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> owned 21.9 million <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> shares by the close of trading Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> reported holding 19.0 million shares Oct. 17. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said on Sept. 19 it planned to buy up to 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> and has bought <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> shares steadily in the open market since receiving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulatory approval earlier this month. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> notified <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> of its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing Monday by telephone but has not met with <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> officials, <ORGANIZATION> Cummins </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are amenable to discuss the issue with them, but no new meetings have been scheduled.'' She said the company would not comment on <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s talks with <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Fund Manager Sues Shearson for $60 Million in Alleged Post-Crash
Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An international money manager has sued <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly cheating a mutual fund out of $ 60 million by manipulating futures prices shortly after the 1987 stock market crash. The complaint, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of Quantum B.V.I. mutual fund, alleges that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> traders and brokers conspired to depress the price of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index contract at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The alleged misconduct occurred Oct. 22, 1987, three days after the market plunge and moments after Quantum entered a large <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P sell order through <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, Quantum said in the lawsuit. The $ 2.1 billion fund is headed by international money manager <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Soros </PERSON>, whose large sell order sent the futures market plunging 24 percent in minutes. The lawsuit charges that <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>, three of its floor brokers and about 100 other traders and brokers conspired to sell 2,400 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 futures held by Quantum at artificially low prices. According to the complaint, traders waited to buy the contracts until after futures price had plunged because of the sell order, and Quantum lost more than $ 60 million. When the market later rebounded, the defendants made a profit by selling the contracts they had bought at depressed prices, Quantum charged. A <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Monday: `` We have reviewed the complaint and do not believe that there is any merit to the allegations, and we do intend to contest the suit. A lawyer for <PERSON> Soros </PERSON> said the lawsuit was filed late Friday to avoid a two-year statute of limitations on such claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Also named as defendants are <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullins </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who were <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> floor brokers in the S & amp; P 500 pit at the time of the trading. In addition to the $ 60 million in alleged losses, the suit seeks $ 100 million in punitive damages.

 Stock prices declined broadly in heavy trading today as the collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buyout helped unnerve an already shaky market. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials spiked downward as much as 85 points in the morning before partially rebounding. It was down 48.36 points to 2,614.55 by 2 p.m. EDT. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout failure, analysts said traders were worried about lower-than-expected corporate profits in the third quarter and signs of economic weakness in the government's latest report on factory orders `` Volatility rules the day,'' said <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, chief investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think we're going to see a lot of this skittishness until we sort out the leadership in this market,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co..

The market bounced back last week, gaining a record 119.88 points total, but the Dow average slipped back by 26.23 on Monday. Analysts said the news that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would remain independent affected other transportation stocks and generally triggered the morning selloff. Computerized program trading also contributed to the decline. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the plunge in stock prices sent <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 stock-index futures down the 12-point limit permitted under `` circuit-breaker'' rules designed to slow heavy market selloffs. Index futures prices rebounded after trading resumed. The government's report today of a slight decline in durable goods orders during September today did nothing to dispel concerns over lower-than-expected corporate profits for the third quarter. Orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods, held back by slumping demand in the transportation category, slipped 0.1 percent in September, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. Analysts said the August and September orders reports were skewed by a big swing in demand for automobiles, which surged in August only to drop back to a more normal level in September. <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond prices rallied, following a recent pattern of showing strength when stocks weaken. The benchmark 30-year bond was up nearly -RCB- point at midday, equal to $ 7.50 per $ 1,000 in face value. Airline stocks were down.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Begins in Third Round of Stock Manipulation Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After two mistrials earlier this year, jury selection began Tuesday in the retrial of <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and its vice chairman on stock manipulation charges. The case initially attracted wide attention because as the first criminal trial stemming from the insider trading scandals of the mid-1980s. It also was seen as a test of information derived indirectly from jailed stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. The most recent mistrial occurred March 23 when a jury announced after 12 days of deliberations that it was hopelessly deadlocked. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> declared the first mistrial in January after determining that prosecutors had unintentionally withheld an expert's report that a key piece of evidence had been altered. <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> began jury selection for the third trial by explaining the charges against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, two subsidiaries, and <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON>. The defendants were indicted in July 1988 for allegedly trying to boost <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price in 1986 shortly before selling a large block of Carbide shares. They were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy. <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON>, N.J.-based chemical and building materials manufacturer, and its two subsidiaries face maximum fines totaling $ 12 million, or $ 500,000 on each of eight counts against each of the three. <PERSON> Sherwin </PERSON> faces 40 years in prison and a fine of up to $ 2 million. The prosecution's main witness against <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> has been <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> stockbroker <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to two felony counts of breaking securities laws in 1987 and began cooperating with the government. <PERSON> Jefferies </PERSON> was sentenced July 6 to five years probation and fined $ 250,000.

 Share prices closed sharply lower Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a reflection of Wall Street's steep drop. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index shed 40.4 points, or 1.85 percent, to finish at 2,149.3.

Volume was a modest 405.4 million shares, up from 276.8 million on Monday, which had been a record low.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled what it called the first true mainframe computer in its 32-year history Tuesday in what may be a direct challenge to <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The announcement came on the same day as <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> itself announced upgrades to its own aging but still dominant line of mainframes, which are the biggest kind of general-purpose computers. The processors in <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s new VAX 9000 series are the most powerful ever introduced by the company, five times as fast as its most powerful previous processors, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Digital has previously focused on raising power by clustering together several mid-sized machines. Tuesday's announcement is seen as a recognition that some jobs can only be done by single, big computers. `` It's going to do very well,'' predicted <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, an analyst who is managing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Digital always has great software and their users have a hunger for power. The users keep getting bigger systems and they'll need this.'' The new systems will be capable of work ranging from supercomputing jobs such as weather forecasting and oil exploration to business jobs such as rapid transaction processing. Although <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> sometimes referred to two of its computers in the 1970s as mainframes, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> McLaren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said that in this case, `` We feel comfortable in saying this is a true mainframe-class machine.'' Prices for the new systems range from $ 1.24 million for the single-processor model to $ 3.92 million for the four-processor model. `` They've essentially been naked in this particular category,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, an analyst with <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harkness </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` They're both refurbishing one end of the product line and extending the company's grasp into new territory.'' At present, about 70 percent of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings come from mainframe hardware and software. In contrast, about 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings and sales stem from its minicomputers. Digital's introduction of a new mainframe coincided with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement Tuesday that it has improved its own mainframe computers and software The centerpiece was <PERSON> Hiperbatch </PERSON>, a piece of software that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said speeds up by as much as 60 percent the processing of overnight, back-office `` batch'' jobs. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest mainframes are still bigger than <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s. The processors of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s new machines can hold up to 4.5 billion characters in live memory, about nine times as much as the maximum of 512 million characters in <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>'s new computers. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Puckett </PERSON> said the announcement in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> had been planned well in advance, and it was `` truly circumstantial'' that it came the same day as the <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> announcement. Batch processing, an unglamorous aspect of computing, consists of end-of-the-day work such as updating customer records at stock brokerage houses, reconciling customer accounts at banks and controlling inventory in factories. <PERSON> Hiperbatch </PERSON> was designed in cooperation with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s computer chief, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, said it had proven to be a `` silver bullet'' for the brokerage house, which was squeezed for time by the emergence of global trading 24 hours a day <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> also announced new equipment and software for manufacturing; upgrades for its aging but still profitable line of 3090 mainframe computers; and new security products, including a $ 1,205 pen that can detect forgery attempts. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is the world's largest computer company, and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Maynard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, is the second largest.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium of computer chip manufacturers, has narrowed the list of contenders for its $ 1 billion plant to <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, officials said Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memories said the finalists, chosen from 57 locations in 15 states, were picked on the basis of financial, business, and quality-of-life considerations. `` What set the finalists apart was that they showed a very balanced approach to satisyfing our needs,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memories. `` These four locations came closest to meeting most of our site requirements and excelled in several areas.'' The consortium of seven companies said its mission is to produce 4-megabit DRAMs _ <ORGANIZATION> Dynamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Access </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memory </ORGANIZATION> _ computer chips, to raise the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share. DRAMs, it said, are an increasingly critical technology for which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is dependent on Japanese sources. DRAMs are used in microwave ovens, cars, VCRs, computers and supercomputers, and most defense projects.

<HEAD>Quarterly Earnings Down 15.6 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roebuck </PERSON> and Co.. Tuesday said its third-quarter profit fell 15.6 percent, reflecting a sharp drop in retailing income and a storm of claims filed against the <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by victims of Hurricane Hugo The claims of more than $ 250 million represented the greatest single storm-damage loss in <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>'s history, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said in announcing its quarterly results. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 257.5 million, or 75 cents a share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $ 305 million, or 80 cents a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter. The per-share earnings reflected a stock-buyback program announced a year ago that has reduced the number of outstanding shares to 343.1 million compared to 379.8 million a year ago, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said. Third-quarter revenue rose 4.8 percent to $ 13.2 billion from $ 12.6 billion, the Chicago-based company said in a news release. Income from the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest retailing operation, plunged 25 percent to $ 82.9 million from $ 110.5 million, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said. Revenue from the retailing division edged up 1.3 percent to $ 7.6 billion from $ 7.5 billion in 1988's third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> attributed the retailing results to a soft market for big-ticket durable goods, such as home appliances, and higher interest costs in the credit segment of the merchandise group. Two retail analysts expressed differing opinions on whether the performance of the merchandise group indicated that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' `` everyday low pricing'' strategy is failing `` My opinion is that they probably have to do more promotion to get the customers in the door,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. But <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Landschultz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Cowen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said the results `` were n't bad at all. The real test of the new retailing strategy will come in the second half of 1990, he said, after <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> finishes reshaping its stores into collections of `` superstores,'' offering low-cost, brand-name items in general groupings such as women's clothing, major appliances or menswear. `` They're still in an adjustment period,'' <PERSON> Cowen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> was upbeat about the strategy, which <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> began implementing last March to better compete with discounters such as <ORGANIZATION> K </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` We're very pleased with the results of everyday low pricing, but that durable goods trough is very real and very significant,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION>'s income fell to $ 126.1 million from $ 202.7 million, largely as a result of damage claims from Hurricane Hugo, which battered the southeastern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coastline in September. The claims exceeded $ 250 million but because of reinsurance _ the practice among large insurance companies of farming out some of their risk to smaller insurers _ the negative impact on <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' third-quarter net income was only $ 80 million, the company said <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> said it was `` a natural conclusion'' that the company would also be hit with a lot of damage claims from the earthquake that struck northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> a week ago. But <PERSON> Rossiter </PERSON> said he could not predict the dollar amount of the earthquake claims. The <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 35.7 million for the quarter, up 32 percent from $ 27.1 million in 1988. Those results included a 71 percent increase in income from Discover Card operations, which totaled $ 23.3 million. Third-quarter income from the <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> jumped to $ 81.2 million from $ 22.2 million last year, reflecting a nearly four-fold increase in after-tax gains from sale of properties. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> reported overall net income of $ 906.4 million, or $ 2.56 per share, compared to $ 1.34 billion, or $ 3.52 per share, for the first nine months of 1988. Nine-month revenue rose 8.2 percent to $ 38.6 billion from $ 35.7 billion. The nine-month results for 1988 include a first-quarter accounting change that resulted in a $ 550,000 increase in the reported net income, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The stock market went for another rough ride today, dropping steeply in morning trading only to finish the day about even. The collapse of the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> buyout helped unnerve an already shaky market, and the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks briefly tumbled as much as 85 points in the first 1 -LCB- hours of trading. After partially rebounding, the Dow Jones average was down between 40 and 50 points for most of the session, then rallied in the final hour. Contributing to the late recovery were separate rumors about billionaire investor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>: one that he was interested in buying <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, and one that he was considering renewing his bid for <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> buyout failure, analysts said traders were worried about lower-than-expected corporate profits in the third quarter and signs of economic weakness in the government's latest report on factory orders Underlying the market's volatility is continued nervousness that Wall Street has not entirely recovered from the Friday the 13th crunch, when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average fell 190.58 points.

 Wall Street rose a session of bucking stock prices today, watching shares plummet in early trading and bounce back up in a late rally to finish the day little changed. The widely watched <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average of 30 industrial stocks, down as much as 85 points in early trading, finished down just 3.69 points at 2,659.22. Broader market indicators also fell in heavy trading, with declining issues outnumbering advancers ones by almost 7 to 2 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 237.96 million shares, compared with 135.86 million in Monday's session. Analysts said news that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors had decided late Monday not to proceed with a buyout plan by an employee-management group affected other transportation stocks and helped trigger the morning selloff. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> finished down $ 8.37 -LCB- at $ 170, after having been down down more than $ 32 a share earlier in the day. Computerized program trading involving stock-index futures also contributed to the decline, market watchers said. The <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> group's Oct. 13 announcement that it was unable to get financing for its $ 6.75 billion buyout played a role in the 190.58-point drop in the Dow industrials that day and turmoil in stock markets worldwide. The market rebounded from that drop, with the Dow industrials gaining a record 119.88 points last week. Market watchers also said the government's report today of a 0.1 percent slight decline in durable goods orders during September did nothing to dispel concerns over lower-than-expected corporate profits for the third quarter.

<HEAD>GM Plans to be Sole Sponsor of Several TV Specials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it is making a multimillion-dollar commitment to become the sole sponsor of several television specials over the next two TV seasons. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, a spokesman for the automaker in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, said the programs will be billed on the broadcast and cable television networks that carry them as `` GM Mark of Excellence Presentations.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is committing about $ 11 million to the project this TV season and an unspecified amount for next TV season starring in the fall of 1990. <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spent about $ 8 million last year to be the sole sponsor of similar shows, and feels that consumers who have watched the shows tend to remember the sponsor and usually have an improved opinion of the company. The new programs will include `` The American Playwright's Theater'' series of plays on the <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Entertainment cable network; the annual `` Kennedy Center Honors'' specials on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, `` The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Achievement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Award </ORGANIZATION>'' special on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s planned movie `` The Old Man and the Sea. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> will be the sole advertiser on telecasts of these programs, which are variously scheduled for later this year through 1991. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> said it had agreed to be the sole corporate underwriter of Public Broadcasting System programs including the `` A World of Ideas with <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyers </PERSON>'' series, the `` Live from Lincoln Center'' series of music and ballet performances and a planned 10-hour movie epic called `` The Civil War.'' <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> has over the past five years of devoted a large portion of the money it spends on `` corporate image'' advertising _ as opposed to `` product'' ads that tout specific cars _ on sole sponsorships. `` It is one company's attempt to underwrite and exclusively sponsor programs we believe are worthy to carry our name ...'' he said. <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> declined to say how much <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spends on corporate image advertising. The trade journal Advertising Age recently estimated that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spent nearly $ 1.3 billion on all types of advertising last year, making it the third-biggest advertiser behind consumer products companies <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>

 The dollar finished lower against most major currencies Tuesday, depressed by volatility on Wall Street and expectations of lower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates. A steep morning plunge of more than 80 points in the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average touched off a heavy but brief flurry of dollar sales that subsided once the stock market started to recover later in the day. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaques </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the dollar did n't manage to recover all of the ground lost during the temporary stock market selloff. The Dow industrials closed with a loss of 3.69 points at 2,659.22. He said currency dealings were lethargic in the early going, with traders lacking a compelling reason to buy or sell. News of a 0.1 percent decline in September orders for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> durable goods created barely a ripple in the currency markets because the figure virtually matched advance estimates. The durable goods report tended to support the view that economic growth is flattening out to such an extent that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might decide to pump it up with more generous credit. Looser credit would push down interest rates. Declining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates generally weigh down the dollar. The dollar began its trading day in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> with a fall to 142.10 Japanese yen from 142.40 yen at Monday's close. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it declined further to 141.95 yen. It was quoted at 141.50 yen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from 141.90 yen on Monday.

 <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond prices rose sharply Tuesday, sustaining most of large early gains despite an afternoon rebound in the volatile stock market. Encouraging signs Tuesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would not drive interest rates higher to fight inflation, the enemy of fixed-income securities such as bonds, also boosted the credit market during a hectic trading day. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, the bellwether 30-year issue gained 5-32 point, or $ 4.69 per $ 1,000 face value, down from as much as 15-32 point earlier in the day. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, tumbled to 7.89 percent from 7.93 percent late Monday. `` The stock market was the real story,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The rise in <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> prices followed a pattern established in the Friday the 13th stock market tumble, when bonds rose sharply as investors shifted money out of stocks when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell about 190 points. The long bond rose about $ 5 on Monday, after the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> closed down 26 points. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> industrial average declined as much as 85 points in the morning session before rebounding to finish the day down 3.69 points. Bond prices typically rise during a stock market selloff because <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, which are guaranteed by the government, are considered a safe haven in times of financial instability. `` Half the gains were sustained and that really was a pretty good performance,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said of Tuesday's dealings. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> also said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> did not drain reserves from the banking system, as widely had been expected. He said that by staying out of the market the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> kept a lid on the federal funds rate, which is regarded as an indicator of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s short-term intentions. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 811-16 percent, up from 8 -RCB- percent Monday. `` People are now convinced the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is more likely to allow the funds rate to be soft than to push them up for fear either the stock market or the economy will tank,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. Prices of short-term governments were up 1-32 point to 5-32 point, intermediate maturities gained -LRB- point to 5-32 point and long-term issues gained from 5-16 point to 7-16 point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the financial-information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 2.38 to 1,193.45. Many corporate bonds also increased. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, gained 0.49 to 338.54. High-yield, lower-rated `` junk'' bonds followed the stock market descent but not its rebound. Traders said many widely traded issues were off about -LCB- point. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was 9225-32, up 3-16 point. The average yield to maturity dropped to 7.31 from 7.33 percent late Monday. Meanwhile, yields three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills auctioned Monday fell to 7.75 as the discount was down 1 basis point to 7.51 percent. Yields on newly auctioned six-month bills fell to 7.85 percent with the discount off 4 basis points to 7.46 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.78 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to 7.26 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity.

<HEAD>Recession Fears Fuel Copper Selloff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices nosedived Tuesday for the third straight day, dropping to 2 -LCB- - month lows on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on selling fueled by perceptions of a weakening economy On other futures markets, precious metals advanced; stock-index futures retreated in a day of wild trading; grain and soybean futures fell; oil futures were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Copper futures settled 0.9 cent to 4.6 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December down 4.5 cents at $ 1.151 a pound, its lowest daily close since Aug. 11. `` It was a bloody, bloody day,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, a metals analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a large commodities brokerage. The decline began early and accelerated as prices fell through successive levels of technical support. The December contract traded as low as $ 1.134 before rebounding shortly before the close. Copper prices have fallen nearly 12 percent in the past seven trading sessions, largely in reaction to an improving supply picture. But analysts said Tuesday's selloff was more a reflection of economic anxiety prompted by the stock market's volatility and by a government report Tuesday that orders for durable goods fell 0.1 percent in September. On the stock market Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> average of 30 industrial stocks briefly tumbled 85 points in the first 1 -LCB- hours of trading, partially rebounded, then was down 40 to 50 points for most of the session before closing with a modest 3.69-point loss. `` I believe the copper market is fearing a recession,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, a commodities trading adviser with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` As an industrial metal, copper would suffer if a recession came along.'' Stock-market jitters and a weaker dollar helped the precious metals as some investors ditched stocks and shifted assets into the perceived safety of gold. Gold settled $ 3.20 higher across the board on the Comex with the December contract at $ 373.40 a troy ounce; silver was 5.4 cents to 5.7 cents higher with December at $ 5.195 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures tripped a circuit-breaker on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> when the December S & amp; P 500 contract fell the permitted 12-point limit, to 335.95, early in the session. The drop triggered a rule prohibiting selling at prices below that level for 30 minutes, but trading halted only momentarily before buying entered the market and prices rebounded. The rule is one of several circuit-breakers designed to slow a market collapse. The contract for December delivery of stocks tracked by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 1.45 points lower at 346.50.

<HEAD>Mobil, Chevron, Shell Earnings Fall; Texaco's Profit Rises</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: UPDATES with 4 final grafs to include Sun Co. earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>

 <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reported an 11 percent rise in third-quarter earnings Tuesday, while <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said earnings declined. The results reflected the benefits of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s post-bankruptcy restructuring as well as the mixed impact of higher crude prices, which helps oil companies boost earnings on the exploration and production end of their business but hurts the `` downstream'' end of refining and marketing. Crude prices have been hovering between $ 19 and $ 20 a barrel, about $ 3 higher than the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings slipped 4 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 to $ 532 million, or $ 1.30 a share, from $ 557 million, or $ 1.36 a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue for the nation's second-largest oil concern totaled $ 13.64 billion, up 4 percent over $ 13.12 billion a year earlier. In the first nine months, New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 1.4 billion, or $ 3.32 a share, down 16 percent from $ 1.6 billion a year earlier. Revenue reached $ 41.69 billion, up 2 percent from $ 40.99 billion. Contributing to the lower quarterly earnings, <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> said, was a decline in chemical results and a $ 40 million provision for restructuring of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exploration and production business. <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> declined to give details of the restructuring except to say that it would involve the transfer and termination of employees over a two-year period `` in order to reduce costs and focus efforts in areas where the projected financial returns are most attractive.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 305 million, or $ 1.10 a share, in the third quarter, up 11 percent from $ 274 million, or $ 1.12 a share, a year earlier. Revenue dipped 4 percent to $ 8.36 billion from $ 8.68 billion, the result of the company's recent post-bankruptcy court restructuring, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the lower per-share earnings in the third quarter reflected a higher number of outstanding shares of common stock as well as a new preferred stock for which the company must set aside reserves. In the first nine months, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings more than doubled to $ 2.13 billion, or $ 8.19 a share, from $ 1.01 billion, or $ 4.14, a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue was down slightly at $ 26.42 billion from $ 26.67 billion. Besides strong gains in the company's exploration and production businesses, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> benefited from the restructuring, which lowered its corporate losses, including interest expenses from the payment of debt, by $ 117 million in the period. `` There are so many changes going on internally that the financial data really is n't comparable with a year ago. It's almost misleading to compare it with last year,'' said oil industry analyst <PERSON> Rosario </PERSON> <PERSON> Ilacqua </PERSON>, with the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> completed the asset-sale portion of the restructuring earlier this year, nearly a year after emerging from bankruptcy <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in April 1987 after losing a high-stakes court battle with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that cost <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> $ 3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, earned $ 417 million, or $ 1.22 a share, in the third quarter, down slightly from $ 420, or $ 1.23 a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 11 percent to $ 8 billion, from $ 7.2 billion. In the nine-months, <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings declined 29 percent to $ 1.13 billion, or $ 3.31 a share, from $ 1.6 billion, or $ 4.66 a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue totaled $ 23.9 billion, up about 9 percent from $ 22 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter earnings fell 7 percent to $ 340 million from $ 364 million a year earlier. Revenue dipped to $ 5.40 billion from $ 5.47 billion. Nine-month earnings grew by 11 percent to $ 1.14 billion, from $ 1.03 billion, while sales at Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> increased 3 percent to $ 16.44 billion from $ 15.94 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> is wholly owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch-Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION>, based in both <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. The company does not report per-share earnings. <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings jumped 18 percent in the third quarter, due largely to higher earnings from the company's Canadian subsidiary and increased exploration and production results overseas. Sun earned $ 85 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with $ 72 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $ 2.73 billion, up 11 percent from $ 2.46 billion. Nine-month earnings totaled $ 271 million, or $ 2.54 a share, a turnaround from the $ 69 million loss, equal to 66 cents a share, recorded in the year-earlier period. Revenue in the first nine months rose 14 percent to $ 8.30 billion from $ 7.28 billion in the 1988 period. Sun said the absence of $ 10 million of losses from domestic exploration and production operations in last year's results contributed to an improvement in the latest figures.

 Oil futures prices closed mixed in lackluster trading Tuesday as the market awaited new statistics on oil inventories. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, finished 4 cents lower at $ 19.72 per 42-gallon barrel.

Wholesale unleaded gasoline for November delivery slipped 0.69 cent to 52.79 cents a gallon while the December contract lost 0.47 cents to end at 52.31 cents a gallon. Domestic heating oil, meanwhile, recovered slightly from sharp declines on Monday. Contracts for November and December delivery each gained 0.3 cent. The November contract settled at 58.45 cents a gallon, while the December contract closed at 58.87 cents. On Monday, the contracts fell 2.02 cents and 2 cents, respectively.

<HEAD>Norfolk Southern Announces $1.65 Billion Repurchase of Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday a 3-year plan to repurchase 45 million shares of its publicly owned stock at market price. The deal is worth around $ 1.65 billion. The transportation company currently is in the midst of a 20 million-share repurchase program that ends at the end of this year. `` We believe our stock purchase program over the last two years has been successful and that an expanded program of purchases should serve to enhance stockholder value,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinnon </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer. <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION>'s third-quarter earnings report is to be issued Wednesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The company has 172.2 million shares publicly held. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman, said <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> has purchased 19 million of the 20 million shares in the first repurchase plan, and expects to buy back the remaining shares by the end of the year. If the remaining 1 million shares and the newly authorized 45 million shares all are acquired, the number of publicly held shares will be reduced by 26 percent, Ms. <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON> said. She said the company began its repurchase program in 1987 after efforts to acquire the <ORGANIZATION> Conrail </ORGANIZATION> system and <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> fell through. <ORGANIZATION> Norfolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> had $ 1 billion in cash reserves and believed its best return was to buy back its own stock. Ms. <PERSON> Noxon </PERSON> said the latest repurchase would be financed by the remainder of that reserve, some borrowed funds, and anticipated income.

 Wall Street added to its casino image Tuesday in a heart-thumping session that saw the Dow Jones 30-stock industrial average plummet 85 points in the morning but rally to finish nearly even. The Dow Jones average closed with a narrow decline of 3.69 points at 2,659.22. Broader measures of the market showed bigger declines than the Dow average. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones more than 3 to 1 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The market's wild behavior was attributed to speculation over the fate of buyout plans for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and continued skittishness dating from the Friday the 13th plunge, when the Dow industrials fell more than 190 points. Adding to the market's volatility was computer-driven program trading, which seems to compress up and down trends into far briefer periods of time. `` This is clearly a market that you ca n't turn your back on for 10 minutes,'' said <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> <PERSON> Biggs </PERSON>, chief investment strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> led the market downward in the morning and back up late in the day, when rumors spread that several potential buyers including <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> were accumulating stock in the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> The initial decline in <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock came after the announcement late Monday by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s board that it had decided to stay independent for now as it examined alternatives to a $ 300-a-share employee-management buyout plan that collapsed earlier this month. The stock of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> fell more than 30 a share in the morning but recovered to finish down only 8 -RRB- at 170. The worst period for the market came at midmorning, when the Dow Jones average fell more than 50 points in less than half an hour to touch its low of 85 points off. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 stock-index futures contract fell the 12-point limit permitted under `` circuit-breaker'' rules designed to slow heavy market selloffs. Index futures prices rebounded after trading resumed. Adding to traders' nervousness Tuesday were lower-than-expected third-quarter profits from several major companies and worries about an economic slowdown. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that orders for `` big ticket'' durable goods slipped 0.1 percent in September. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, director of research at <ORGANIZATION> Fahnestock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was alarmed by reports that <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> takeover speculation was the main factor in the market's rally in the final hour. `` I would truly hope that an event such as that -LRB- a new offer for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, true or not, would not be enough to turn the entirety of financial assets, stocks and bonds, on its ear. That would raise questions about the underpinnings of the market, would n't you say?'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said. Aside from <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>, other actively traded issues included <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION>, which fell ~ to 44 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up | to 44 -LCB-; <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, down ~ at 38 ~; and <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 -RCB- at 68 At the close, among New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, there were 360 issues up, 1,213 down and 381 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to a heavy 237.96 million shares, up from 135.86 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 283.28 million shares. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the nation's stock markets as a whole fell $ 18.69 billion, or 0.55 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.85 to 190.05. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell 0.75 to 392.83, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index fell 1.13 to 343.70. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell 5.52 to 461.70. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 376.36, down 3.10.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has bought 5,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> surplus butter at cut-rate prices, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday.

The butter was sold for $ 1,620 per ton delivered to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports, an average of less than 74 cents a pound. A metric ton equals about 2,205 pounds. According to the department's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the surplus butter cost about $ 1.40 per pound to acquire under the government's dairy price support program. The 1985 farm law, as amended by the Hunger Relief Act of 1988, requires the export sale of 150,000 tons of surplus dairy products each fiscal year through September 30, 1990. Products sold under the program generally are sold at prevailing market prices.

<HEAD>Reports Increase in Third-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Supercomputer maker <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reported a 35.4 percent increase in third-quarter earnings, but said the results still lag behind expectations. The company, which earlier this month announced plans to lay off 400 workers or 7 percent of its workforce, reported earnings of $ 30.65 million, $ 1.04 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30. That compares with 1988 third-quarter earnings of $ 22.61 million or 73 cents per share. Third-quarter 1989 revenues were $ 210.16 million, up 44.7 percent from $ 145.21 million in the same period a year ago. Earnings for the first nine months of the year total only $ 36.57 million or $ 1.24 per share, compared with $ 68.1 million or $ 2.19 per share for the same period a year ago. Nine-month revenue totaled $ 454.56 million compared with $ 425.42 million for the first nine months of 1988. `` Since much of our current backlog is for 1989 deliveries, we do not have great visibility into 1990,'' said <PERSON> Marcelo </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gumucio </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief operating officer. `` With the visibility we do have, along with an assessment of our prospect list, we have concluded it is prudent to plan for next year on the assumption that revenue again will be flat.'' He said based on the company's revised projections, earnings results will likely be 40 percent to 45 percent lower than the company's 1988 performance of $ 156.6 million. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> said customers accepted 17 systems, with total contract value of about $ 175 million, during the third quarter. The value of systems ordered during the quarter totaled about $ 145 million, and the value of the order backlog at the end of the quarter was about $ 315 million compared to $ 340 million at the end of the second quarter.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>, whose authority at the wheel of <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> plunged along with company profits for the past nine months, has relinquished his last title with the truck maker. With the company on the verge of announcing a third-quarter loss it expects to be about $ 50 million and looking at projected losses in the final three months of the year, <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> resigned Monday as chairman. <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> lost the post of president to newcomer <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reins </PERSON> in June when expectations of a loss in the second quarter were announced, and then chief executive to the heir apparent in September when the third-quarter projection was disclosed. <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>'s resignation will be effective with the election of his successor, possibly as soon as Nov. 2, when the <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> board of directors will hold a special meeting, Reins said. The push to remove <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> apparently has been led by <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION>'s truck operations, which owns about 45 percent of <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s stock and has four directors on <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s 10-member board `` Heads will roll at <LOCATION> Mack </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Phillipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gras </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION>'s truck operations, promised a French newspaper after the third-quarter projections were announced <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>, 56, moved out of his office at <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s world headquarters in <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION> Friday, concluding a 10-year stay in the sixth-floor executive offices. <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> is the third key executive to leave the company in recent months, following the departures of <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> LaFontaine </PERSON>, executive vice president of administration, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, executive vice president of manufacturing.

StatesWest's proposal `` did not set forth the source of funds for the proposal or describe the terms of the StatesWest securities which the proposal contemplated would be issued to <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> shareholders by <PERSON> StatesWest </PERSON>,'' he said in a news release. <PERSON> StatesWest </PERSON> had offered about $ 15.3 million in cash and StatesWest securities for all of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>'s common stock that <PERSON> StatesWest </PERSON> did not already own. The offer, made in a letter from <ORGANIZATION> StatesWest </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, called for $ 7 a share in cash plus securities of StatesWest with a value of $ 3 a share. <PERSON> Risley </PERSON> has said <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> has 1.65 million shares of stock outstanding. StatesWest acquired 7.25 percent of the stock in May, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said he had recently purchased some additional stock. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> officials said earlier this month they had no interest in a friendly takeover proposal by <PERSON> StatesWest </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> later announced it was examining the possibility of buying <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Quaker Oats Reports 24 Percent Gain In Quarterly Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced a 24 percent gain in its fiscal first-quarter profit Tuesday, citing strong improvement in its domestic and international food businesses. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> reported net income of $ 55.7 million, or 70 cents a share, for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $ 45 million, or 57 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Results for the prior year's first quarter were restated to reflect an accounting change that resulted in a charge of $ 6.4 million before taxes and $ 3.7 million after taxes, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> said. Quarterly sales rose slightly to $ 1.44 billion from $ 1.43 billion a year ago, the company said. Operating income from <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> food operations soared 66 percent to $ 62.8 million from $ 37.8 million despite only a $ 300,000 increase in sales, to $ 901.4 million, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> said. The improvement resulted from lower advertising and merchandising costs as a percentage of sales, and from better productivity, the company said. `` We are taking a more focused approach to our advertising and merchandising expenditures by targeting high-margin, value-added products with our marketing dollars,'' said Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smithburg </PERSON>. Quaker reported operating income from international food operations at $ 38.6 million, a 55 percent gain over the $ 24.9 million reported in last year's fiscal first quarter. Operating income from <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fisher-Price </ORGANIZATION> toy subsidiary fell 32 percent to $ 28.9 million from $ 42.7 million, mainly due to lower shipments of toys, the company said. First-quarter financing costs, including interest expenses and foreign exchange, rose by $ 13.1 million to $ 30.7 million, mainly due to borrowing for the fiscal 1989 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced Tuesday it has set up procedures to accept bids to buy the company from interested parties, but one potential buyer alleged the company is n't seriously considering offers. The international doughnut shop chain, which battled takeover attempts for months before deciding in September to accept bids on a friendly basis, set a Nov. 10 deadline for receiving bids. The move came after a Canadian partnership filed a motion Monday to bring to early trial its lawsuit against the doughnut chain, alleging the company reneged on its promise to receive friendly bids. `` We've been responding to the fact that they are bringing up litigation again,'' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Dunkin' Donuts. Several companies have expressed interest in buying the company, which is based in this <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburbn, she said. <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts officials, however, refused to say the company was for sale. `` No determination has yet been made to sell the company, although such a sale is one alternative being considered,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, in a statement released Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> DD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> partnership that has pursued <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts since June, asked the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Monday to move up a trial date for its lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Dunkin' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Donuts </ORGANIZATION>, currently set for Nov. 1 or later. The suit challenges a series of extensive efforts <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts undertook to prevent its acquisition. The trial date was postponed after <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts announced Sept. 29 it would begin looking at alternatives, including a merger or leveraged buyout, to try to increase its stock price. <ORGANIZATION> DD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> offered <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts $ 45 a share, or $ 308 million, in late August, up from an offer of $ 43 a share tendered two weeks earlier. <PERSON> Dunkin </PERSON>' Donuts reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, much of it attributed to costs associated with battling the hostile takeover.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> reported Tuesday its third-quarter profit rose 10.4 percent from the same period last year, spurred by the performance of four new products. The New Brunswick-based pharmaceutical maker said earnings rose to $ 265 million, or 80 cents a share, compared with $ 240 million, or 71 cents a share, for the same 1988 period. The company also set a quarterly sales record, up 11.5 percent to $ 2.45 billion from $ 2.2 billion in last year's third quarter. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer, said the sales record was particularly pleasing in light of increasing competition in domestic consumer markets. `` <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> posted record revenues in the quarter due to the exceptionally strong sales growth by the pharmaceutical business and a solid performance by the professional operations,'' he said in a statement. <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> cited four new company products in particular. Acuvue, a disposable contact lens, and Hismanal, an antihistamine, led the domestic sales surge, he said. Eprex, a drug used by dialysis patients suffering from anemia, and Prepulsid, a gastro-intestinal drug, were leaders in overseas sales, he said. Net earnings for the first nine months of 1989 were $ 879 million, or $ 2.64 a share, up 11.3 percent from $ 790 million, or $ 2.31 a share, for the last year's first nine months. Sales increased 7.1 percent to $ 7.29 billion from $ 6.8 million, the company said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday a 6 percent increase in sales and settlement of a cookie formula infringement suit gave the company a 38 percent increase in its fiscal first-quarter earnings. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, P & amp; G had a profit of $ 551 million, or $ 1.66 a share, on sales of $ 5.57 billion. During the same period last year, the company earned $ 400 million, or $ 1.18 a share, on sales of $ 5.26 billion. The per-share figures are adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split stockholders approved this month. The company received a $ 125 million settlement during the quarter in a patent-infringement lawsuit it filed accusing three food companies of infringing on P & amp; G's formula for chewy cookies. P & amp; G received the settlement from <ORGANIZATION> Keebler </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Frito-Lay </ORGANIZATION> under a consent judgment signed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Longobardi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> last month.

 The president of the international <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union toured picket lines Tuesday on the 21st day of a strike by 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, also was to meet with local union leaders as the strike against the aerospace giant continued with no negotiations scheduled. <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> on Monday addressed a gathering of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> strikers in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, but no rally was planned in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kourpias </PERSON> instead planned to visit pickets at all of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s major installations in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area. `` We had our rally last weekend,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>. About 5,000 people attended a strike march and rally Saturday featuring a speech by the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The visit came two days before the first strike payments, a flat $ 100 a week per striker from a $ 100 million Machinists strike fund, and a day after <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> reiterated the company's hard-line stance. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Deane </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> said two 737-300s were delivered Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, bringing total deliveries during the strike to 18 _ all planes that were virtually complete before the walkout. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, a Belgian charter firm, ordered 12 jets, a mixture of 737-300 and -400 models, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheeler </PERSON>. Firm orders received during the strike now total 68 aircraft worth $ 4.3 billion, boosting total orders for 1989 to 804 planes worth $ 42.8 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s firm-order backlog is now 1,653 planes worth about $ 82 billion, with deliveries stretching into the late 1990s, <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> said Monday that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> would not increase its total money offer because any boost would jeopardize the company's competitive position The union represents 57,800 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> production workers nationwide, including 43,300 around <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, 12,000 in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and several hundred at sites in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and other states. A three-year offer that was rejected in an 85 percent strike vote Oct. 3 included pay increases of 4 percent, 3 percent and 3 percent; bonuses of 8 percent of gross pay in the first year and 3 percent in the second; cost-of-living increases to cover inflation; a 20 percent reduction in mandatory overtime; and higher benefits. The production-halting strike against the world's largest commercial airplane builder began Oct. 4. The only talks since then collapsed after less than four hours last week with no further meetings scheduled. Meanwhile, contract talks with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s second-largest union, the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> resumed Tuesday. Preliminary talks covering 28,000 engineers and technical workers, about 95 percent in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, began Oct. 16 but broke off later that day with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> negotiators complaining of excessive pay demands. Leaders of the association are seeking a three-year pact with pay raises of 14 percent in the first six months, 5 percent the second and 4 percent every half-year thereafter for engineers. For technical workers, the association is seeking 14 percent the first year and 2 percent every six months thereafter. The association's contracts expires Dec. 1. Both sides have said a strike is unlikely.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was lower against the Japanese yen Wednesday morning, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> bounced back. The dollar was changing hands at 141.63 yen at late morning after opening at 141.57 yen, down 0.53 yen from Tuesday's 142.10-yen finish It was moving in the narrow range of 141.55 to 141.75 yen by late Wednesday morning. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 71.90 points, or 0.20 percent, to move to 35,598.45 to end the morning session. On Tuesday it shed 58.97 points Tuesday. The Nikkei rebounded as the yen's recovery against the dollar reassured Japanese market players, said <PERSON> Yoshiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON>, a stock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. `` Participants bought mainly domestic core industries issues, including housing, railways and constructions,'' he said. `` After the market crash in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> almost two weeks ago Japanese investors started buying domestic core industry issues and avoiding import-export related issues, which had been the market leaders,'' <PERSON> Inoue </PERSON> said. In currency dealings, the dollar started lower after a similar downswing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight as American investors sold the currency. The dollar in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ended at 141.56 yen, down from 141.90 yen the previous day. Many Japanese market players expect the dollar to fall more, considering a recent downtrend in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates, said a trader with a major Japanese commercial bank, speaking on condition of anonymity. But the dollar was unlikely to fall too quickly because institutional investors tended to buy the dollar whenever it fell during trading, he said.
