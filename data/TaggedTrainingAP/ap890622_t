 Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said Thursday he was unable to set up conciliation talks between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as requested by President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. Also Thursday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government of spreading `` systematic lies'' to discredit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and its preparations for free elections in 1990. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> publicly asked <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, on Monday to act as a go-between in setting up the talks with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration resolve its differences with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist Sandinista regime. The cardinal said he would think about it, but <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rudi </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> on Tuesday rejected the offer. He said an improvement in relations would depend on a number of factors, including `` an end to Nicaraguan support'' for leftist guerrillas in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, also said <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> should hold free and fair elections under international supervision and enter into of a genuine dialogue with opposition groups before the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agrees to sit down and talk. Referring to <PERSON> Boone </PERSON>'s statement, <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> saying that `` for the time being it is not possible to enter into a process of mediation ... because one of the parties has officially set conditions for the dialogue.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> read the <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>'s letter at a news conference, expressed thanks to the cardinal, and said he will `` insist through other venues with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to accept a dialogue with <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off all aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1980, started supporting Contra rebels the next year and slapped an economic embargo on this nation in 1985 to pressure the Sandinistas to hold free and fair elections and sever military ties with Soviet bloc nations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations have argued that Soviet and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> military aid to the <LOCATION> Sandinistas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s help to the Salvadoran guerrillas is threatening security in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The Sandinistas claim they have been providing only moral support to the Salvadoran rebels. An attempt by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to hold talks in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in 1984 ended in deadlock, with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration accusing the Sandinistas of failing to negotiate in good faith. The 14-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday asked <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y Bravo to try and set up talks with the Sandinista government to try and resolve these differences. But the cardinal, himself a sharp critic of the Sandinistas, did not respond immediately. Earlier Thursday, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration of spreading `` systematic lies'' to discredit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and denied allegations by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is allying itself with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> to form a three way anti-U.S. alliance. Speaking in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, where he was attending a Third World meeting, <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said: `` I would take anything a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government official says with a ton of salt. Systematic lying is an instrument of their foreign policy. The only thing he -LRB- <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> -RRB- needs for his opinions is his mouth.'' <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> also denied recent allegations by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s election procedures and said the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> were `` strictly complying with the agenda for the elections in February 1990. Critics have said the government stacked a national election board, which will supervise the balloting process, in favor of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. Also, as of June 1 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens were required for the first time to get visas to enter <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, making it difficult for American observers to be there.

<TEXT>
 Authorities are interrogating two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and two West German pilots after Indian air force fighters forced down their small planes near the Pakistani border, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> identified the Americans as <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rocksprings </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The two, making an around-the-world trip in a Beechcraft Bonanza, were intercepted by the Indian jets on June 16 and forced to land at <LOCATION> Bhuj </LOCATION> airfield in western <LOCATION> Gujarat </LOCATION> state, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The spokesman, who can not be identified under briefing rules, said the two men were traveling with two West Germans, whose Beechcraft also was ordered to land at <LOCATION> Bhuj </LOCATION>, about 500 miles southwest of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. A West German Embassy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, identified the Germans pilots with only their last names as <PERSON> Kuhlmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kuffner </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the planes had strayed about 310 miles off the assigned course and intruded into restricted airspace over <LOCATION> Bhuj </LOCATION>, a marshy wasteland near the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Civil aviation authorities cleared the planes to fly from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, he said. The pilots were first questioned by air force officers and later handed over to federal intelligence officers, he said. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> offical said a consular officer attended the interrogation. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Privacy Act prevented disclosing more information about the pilots, said the official who can not be identified under briefing rules. Haile and <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> departed from the suburban <PERSON> Addison </PERSON> airport in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> three weeks ago. Haile, the owner and president of a Dallas-based engineering firm, has flown around the world twice and is an experienced long-distance pilot, according to his wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators are looking into the apparent diversion of up to $ 90,000 in housing funds intended for poor families living in federally subsidized apartments here, it was reported Thursday. The money was supposed to cover rent and utility bills in 1986 to early 1988 for five families who lived in the housing complexes known as <ORGANIZATION> Interregional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartments </ORGANIZATION>, the Austin American-Statesman said. The 99 apartments were shut down by the city in September because of building code violations. `` It may be a while before we can get to it, but it is scheduled for investigation,'' said <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the Housing and Urban Development regional inspector general in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. `` Right now, it's waiting in line with a lot of other cases,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said. `` It's a question of time and manpower.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> refused to say who might have diverted the funds, saying it's their policy not to comment on ongoing investigations In another development, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> said Thursday that almost a third of the $ 257,012 that federal auditors said might be missing from the agency's office here has been found. Payments have been received or documentation found for $ 80,046.95 from the sale of five foreclosed homes during a 4 -LCB- - year period, said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> office In a June 13 report, federal auditors identified 16 <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> transactions for which the agency had n't received payment. Auditors said the proceeds, plus $ 30,486 in damages, should be paid to the government. Authorities and <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION>, which handled closings on the sales, are looking for documentation of the remaining 11 transactions, which brought $ 176,965.50, officials said. If the transfer of the money ca n't be documented, <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> said, the government stands to get its money either from <ORGANIZATION> Indianapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> or its bonding company. Last week, a private escrow agent from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> nicknamed `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> HUD'' told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> she diverted millions of dollars from government housing programs. The agent, <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, admitted to investigators that she did not forward at least $ 5.5 million to the federal housing agency, saying she donated much of the money to charitable projects to provide housing for the poor. In <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, the principal owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Interregional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartments </ORGANIZATION> is <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Benard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifshutz </PERSON>, who said he was aware that some subsidies were taken but he was not involved. Another partner in the project, listed in city records as <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, could not be located, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Lifshutz </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> are no longer business partners and he had not spoken to <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> in months. According to a letter from the city to the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general, the apparent diversion of federal utility subsidies took place between August 1986 and February 1988. Former acting City Manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ware </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members in a memo last year that the exact amount of money taken was hard to determine because the owners' records for those years `` are virtually non-existent.'' City staff at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the federally subsidized housing program, said they believe the amount was $ 80,000 to $ 90,000. The department staff first learned of the problem when Interregional tenants complained that their electric, gas, and water services were being disconnected. City records show that dozens of the apartments were overrun with rats and cockroaches; contained exposed and damaged plumbing and wiring; had holes in some of the floors and ceilings; and could not meet minimal city building and safety codes. Police records also show that by 1986 the apartment complexes had become a center of criminal activity, including prostitution and drug dealing. At one point, police records show, one tenant at <ORGANIZATION> Interregional </ORGANIZATION> offered `` drive-up curb service,'' making drug deals through an apartment window.

 Military officials and former comrades of Col. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` Pappy'' <PERSON> Boyington </PERSON> dedicated a life-size bust Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> here to honor the late World War II ace. <PERSON> Boyington </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and son, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, attended the ceremonies at the base, the home of VMA-214, the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>. The nickname for the group originated around the idea that members of the squadron, formed in the <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in 1942, were misfits. <PERSON> Boyington </PERSON> shot down 28 aircraft while fighting in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Theater </LOCATION>, and his squadron accounted for a total of 197 Japanese planes.

 Convicted felon and four-time presidential candidate <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> announced plans Thursday to run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next year. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, 65, a <LOCATION> Loudoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> resident, wants to represent <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s 10th District, which includes <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, half of <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Loudoun </LOCATION> counties. After filing his intent to run for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on June 8, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> became the first Democrat to announce plans to go after incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> representative <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>'s seat. <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was convicted in January in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> on charges of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud and conspiracy to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>.

 The city has purchased the ground under an adult book store and plans to evict the business when the lease expires next month. The $ 257,400 purchase capped a drive by residents and other business owners in the area to shut down <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Book </LOCATION> and Video, which they complained sported racks of nudie magazines and sexually oriented videos. The <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in this oceanside town midway between <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> finally agreed to buy the property, and City Attorney <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Thiele </PERSON> announced completion of the sale Tuesday.

The city plans to resell the property as soon as possible, placing a deed restriction on it that would prevent another adult entertainment establishment from moving there. Before the city sells the property, however, officials want to annex the unincorporated land into the city, Commissioner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Manya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the bookstore, said he did not want to talk about the city's plans or any legal action the company might take. `` What's done is done,'' <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> said. `` If the city wants to buy -LRB- the property -RRB-, that's their mistake.''

<TEXT>
 The operator of the <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> nuclear power plant has decided to accept bids for a private takeover of the facility, despite a referendum that called for its shutdown. The 3-2 vote by directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday angered many of the activists who have fought for years to shut down the plant, which has nearly a continuous history of operating problems. On March 2, the directors had voted unanimously to abide by the results of the June 6 referendum, in which voters turned down an advisory measure endorsing the <ORGANIZATION> Sacramento </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utility </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>'s plans to keep the plant running. The plant was taken off line June 7 and so far about 400 contract workers have lost their jobs. Utility directors voting with the majority argued that voters merely had forbidden <ORGANIZATION> SMUD </ORGANIZATION> from operating the plant. Divestiture of Rancho Seco `` remains a viable option ... that could free this community from the staggering costs of decommissioning,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Buonaiuto </PERSON>, president of the utility's board of directors The utility estimates it will cost about $ 200 million to close the plant. Sacramentans for Safe Energy, an anti-Rancho Seco group, has said it will sue to stop efforts to transfer <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seco </LOCATION> to private businesses that might continue to operate it. `` We will wait and see what happens in the 10-day period'' that the utility set to accept bids, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Remy </PERSON>, an environmental attorney affiliated with the group. `` Our position still is that enough is enough.''

 Parasols have been placed over tropical orchids, swamp crayfish have crawled out of a canal, and race goers have collapsed with sunstroke at <LOCATION> Royal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ascot </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is in the midst of a heat wave and Britons _ notorious for never being accustomed to coping with an occasional hot summer or cold winter _ are doing the best they can. The heat since mid-May has pushed up demand for water in many areas by 50 percent. In parts of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and along the Welsh border in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, many homes are without water main supplies. `` Even if this dry spell breaks, it is unlikely to help,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwent </PERSON> of Southern Water. He said water reserves were at near-crisis levels before the heat wave because of a mild winter and the longest spring in memory. As of today, people who use sprinklers or hoses to water their gardens or wash their cars are threatened with a $ 620 fine by the <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies parts of north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Bans on such use were already in force in other parts of the country. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Valley </PERSON> said Wednesday it was sending out patrols and hiring extra staff to look for violators because demand by its customers has risen from 60 million gallons a day to 85 million gallons. The tough measures followed weeks of television advertising by the publicly run water boards seeking to attract potential investors prior to privatization. Now that the heat's on, they are running out of water. One town actually ran out. Tankers had to deliver water to <LOCATION> Nelson </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lancashire </LOCATION>, where officials blamed the drying-up mostly on avid gardeners leaving hoses spouting all night. Quirks of the heat ranged from officers at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> firing pistols to drive off flocks of swifts attracted by swarms of insects, and trout dying at a fish farm in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> when their pond dried up. Human casualties resulted, too. Thirteen people drowned last weekend trying to cool off in lakes, rivers, canals and pools. When the Royal Ascot race meeting opened Tuesday, ambulance workers said they treated more than 50 people for mild sunstroke or fainting, reviving them with orange juice and ice cubes. The weather was a degree or two cooler Wednesday after temperatures in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> hit 88 degrees on Tuesday, the hottest June day in 13 years. It was already almost as hot in May, when orchids at the Chelsea Flower Show were shielded with umbrellas so they would n't wilt. Hundreds of creatures hitherto unknown to Londoners crawled out of the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> in the capital's <LOCATION> Kensal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> district. They were identified as Central European swamp crayfish, seven inches long, all waving legs, claws and whiskers. No one knew how the mud bugs got there, but <PERSON> London </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoo </PERSON> said they must have bred in large numbers as a result of unusually high temperatures. Borough authorities in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> appealed to householders to take a bucket of water a day to young trees in the streets facing `` water starvation.'' The trees were planted after a hurricane in 1987 felled an estimated 15 million trees in southern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that pests like aphids threatened to reach `` epidemic levels'' in gardens and on farms.

<TEXT>
 Almost every day, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s state-run media carry a new report about privation in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> or a purported shooting on the heavily guarded border between the two countries. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> are allies in the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact military alliance, but not even a summit of their Communist leaders last August could ease the tensions between them. Their relations illustrate the depth of many historically rooted quarrels now reappearing in the Soviet bloc that includes <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. For centuries, <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has been a volatile region of shifting political allegiances and changing borders. A violent history has made nationalism a powerful force and left many ethnic groups in the area with a long list of grudges against neighbors. World War I broke up the once vast Austro-Hungarian Empire and World War II left the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> dominant in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Authoritarian Communist governments took power after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> swept in and ended <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s reign. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, following the model laid down by <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, used to exert pressure on East European Communist parties to maintain outwardly friendly relations. With <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader, those pressures eased. Until recently, traditional conflicts among ethnic groups with different languages and cultures lay mostly dormant under slogans trumpeting the international solidarity of socialism. Now, the Soviets are preoccupied with their own economic and social woes, and the ethnic tensions are bubbling across the borders. The East European allies, grappling with Kremlin-led calls for democratic reforms, are reopening old wounds. Current quarrels vary from ideological differences over the pace of governmental reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and other countries to territorial disputes, minority rights and even cross-border pollution. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have argued over their common border and fishing rights in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has angered <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> by sending chemical waste wafting across the <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION>; and customs wars have flared in a region strapped for consumer goods. In November, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> annoyed the entire bloc by slapping restrictions at 48 hours' notice on the export of just about every consumer product Soviet bloc visitors might envy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s relatively well-stocked shops Poles were especially outraged by measures that included confiscation of purchases intended as Christmas gifts. Polish travelers felt that the Czechs were deliberately reviving a historical enmity between the two populations. The customs crackdown was designed to protect living standards that have helped <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s hard-line leaders keep outward peace with a population disgruntled ever since the 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion crushed <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s reformist government. But the action immediately touched off retaliations throughout the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. Each country, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, slapped export bans on any consumer goods popular with tourists from elsewhere in the region. That conflict has since died down. The most serious dispute involves <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. Simmering throughout the 1970s, it broke into the open in late 1986 over the seemingly innocuous issue of a Hungarian history book on <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, a mountainous region ruled by <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for centuries but ceded to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> after World War I. Under President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> is trying to eradicate the separate identity of ethnic minorities, and it immediately accused <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> of publishing the history with the aim of reviving claims to <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>. At first, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> played calm on the diplomatic front, while media and intellectuals whipped up emotions at home. Hungarians have given refuge to tens of thousands of Romanians since January 1988, when <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> broke a Hungarian-Romanian treaty obliging it to send back defectors, some of whom braved border gunfire to escape. Besides playing to proudly nationalist Hungarians, <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s handling of the dispute served to underline <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s reformist politics and to ally it with the West at international forums on human and minority rights Other East bloc neighbors have since begun to take more heed of the sizeable Hungarian minorities left in their territories. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> recently improved educational opportunities for its small Hungarian minority and allowed more visits across the common frontier. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s 900,000 ethnic Hungarians have also received better treatment. These improvements were overshadowed, however, by <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s quarrels with <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> over a Hungarian television interview with <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s suspension of work on a joint dam and power project. Police crackdowns on anti-government protests in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> in January and the subsequent jailing of leading dissident author <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> drew public protests from intellectuals in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> pointedly attended two <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> plays banned in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. A Hungarian TV interview with <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, virtually a non-person in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> since he was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1970, further rankled <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s leaders. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> ignored their protests and broadcast a second part of the interview anyway. Tension increased last month when <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> called a two-month halt to its work on a joint <LOCATION> Danube </LOCATION> dam project that has been a subject of an environmental controversy since its inception in 1977. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> again strongly protested the move. This time, however, it seemed as if an East bloc row might lead to domestic protests. When prime ministers <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> met to discuss the power project, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> took a conciliatory tone in an effort to defuse tensions.

<TEXT>
 A policy reversal by Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has led state and federal officials to agree on a plan to deport about 1,000 illegal aliens held in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> prisons. In 1985, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> issued an executive order forbidding state investigators from working on deportation cases unless ordered to do so by a court. That order was portrayed as gesture of good will toward illegals at a time when the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was cracking down. Under the new policy agreed to Tuesday, the state will work with <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials to identify and deport inmates of the crowded state and county prison system who are in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> illegally. When possible, the state will work `` aggressively to get these people out on the next plane,'' said Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, who oversees <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' correction system. Regional <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, who met Tuesday with <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> to work out the plan's details and has criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' order, called the agreement `` a step in the right direction.'' About 1,300, or 10 percent, of the approximately 13,000 inmates in state prisons are illegal aliens, according to <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. Of the 1,300, about 1,000 are eligible for immediate deportation. Most of the inmates involved have been involved in drug dealing, and come from <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>. Some convicted of particularly violent crimes, including four men serving sentences for the rape at <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dan </ORGANIZATION>'s tavern in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> in 1984, will remain in prison, <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> turned 13 on June 12, 1942. She received a blue blouse, roses, a bottle of slightly fermented grape juice, a party game, a plant, a dish of sticky molasses, a bowl of truffles and a homemade strawberry tart. She was also given a squarish book, commonly used to collect autographs, with a red and white checked cover. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> began keeping a diary. What began as an adolescent's longing for self-knowledge evolved into a lasting document about the destruction of human life, the tragic loss of innocence and unfathomable hatred of the Holocaust. Forced into hiding by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> chronicled her days with uncommon humor, perceptiveness and faith in the goodness of people. `` The Diary of <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'' stands as a moving, tangible document, and has sold millions of copies around the world. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> died at the <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION> concentration camp in 1945, and would have been 60 this year. A critical edition of her diary has been released in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Doubleday </PERSON>. A popular student at a Jewish school in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> was a pretty, dark-haired girl, outspoken in class and admired by many boys. Yet the diary would prove to be her most cherished friend.

 `` I have darling parents and a sister -LRB- <PERSON> Margot </PERSON> -RRB- of 16. I know about 30 people whom one might call friends _ I have strings of boy friends, anxious to catch a glimpse of me and who, failing that, peep at me through mirrors in class. I have relations, aunts ad uncles, who are darlings too, a good home, no _ I do n't seem to lack anything. `` But it's the same with all my friends, just fun and joking, nothing more. ... We do n't seem to be able to get any closer... Perhaps I lack confidence, but anyway, there it is, a stubborn fact and I do n't seem to be able to do anything about it.''

 While hiding from the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> was transformed from a playful girl of 13 to an insightful, compassionate, even spiritual 15-year-old. On Jan. 6, 1944, she recalled a dream about a boy from school: `` I awoke at this point, while I could still feel his cheek against mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my heart, so deep, that here he read how much I loved him and how much I still love him. Tears sprang into my eyes once more, and I was very sad that I had lost him again. ...'' In another dream, she saw her late grandmother and a friend from school. `` ... Granny appeared as a guardian angel; then followed <PERSON> Hanneli </PERSON>, who seems to be a symbol to me of all the sufferings of all my girlfriends and all Jews. When I pray for her, I pray for all Jews and all those in need. ...'' Prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Netherlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> for War Documentation, the book includes essays on the Franks before and after they went into hiding, the events surrounding their capture, and how the diary reached publication. The new edition contains three versions of the diary: <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s first and second drafts, and the original published work, which combines the two But commemorating her birth was not the only reason for the reissue. The book also offers a strong rebuttal to accusations made over the years that the diary was fake, a shameless exploitation. In the late 1950s, right-wing newspapers in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> published attacks on the diary, insisting the ideas expressed were far too sophisticated for a teen-age girl. In the mid -'70s, a German publishing house began distributing pamphlets repeating charges that <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s father, had written the diary with the help of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Upon <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s death in 1980, the original manuscripts were turned over to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> war documentation institute; work on the critical edition began the following year. One of the book's editors, <PERSON> Gerrold </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroom </PERSON>, insisted in a recent interview that the diary is indeed authentic `` We asked the Dutch forensic laboratory of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, which does the same work for police, to check the paper and ink. They found that all the paper and all the ink, were very common for the first half of the 1940s,'' he said. `` They also compared the letters before the war, postcards, etc., that she had written to her grandmother in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, with the handwriting in the diaries. They found that the same person wrote everything.'' The <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> lived in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, until 1933 when they emigrated to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> took power. The Nazis occupied the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in 1940, and began imposing ever harsher anti-Jewish laws, forcing Jews to wear a yellow six-pointed star. When the SS, the Nazi military police, issued a call-up notice to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> in July 1942, the family was forced into hiding. For more than two years, the <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> and four others were holed up in a `` Secret Annexe,'' located upstairs from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s warehouse in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>. They relied on friends, notably <PERSON> Miep </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gies </PERSON>, to bring them food and supplies, and prayed that the Allied troops would liberate their country before the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> could find them. Police raided the annex on Aug. 4, 1944, and the prisoners were sent off to <LOCATION> Westerbork </LOCATION>, a Jewish transit camp. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> and her sister, <PERSON> Margot </PERSON>, were later shipped to the notorious death camp, <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, and eventually to <LOCATION> Bergen-Belsen </LOCATION>, where they contracted typhoid fever and perished within days of each other in the winter of 1945. Their mother died at another camp. After the arrest, <PERSON> Miep </PERSON> <PERSON> Gies </PERSON> gathered up <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s papers and kept them under lock and key. When <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> in June 1945, he headed straight for the Gies home and was presented with his daughter's journals.

 `` I see the eight of us with our ` Secret Annexe' as if we were a little piece of blue heaven, surrounded by heavy black rain clouds,'' <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> wrote on Nov. 8, 1943. `` The round, clearly defined spot where we stand is safe, but the clouds gather more closely about us and the circle which separates us from the approaching danger closes more and more tightly.''

 In 1947, a Dutch edition of the diary was published to overwhelming acclaim.

 When GIs came home after World War II, the nation looked to the great forests of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> for lumber to build their houses. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> mills responded, and still supply more than a third of the lumber and plywood used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There was always that one more shining hill covered with trees to the west,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> budget officer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` Now we find there's a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and we fell into it.'' From the western slope of the Cascade Range to the shore of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, this is the home of the Douglas fir, the towering king of the ancient forests whose structural strength tops all other lumber. It is also home to the Northern spotted owl, a 14-inch bird that could face extinction because, with rare exceptions, it wo n't nest or hunt anywhere but the dwindling virgin forests that are most prized for timber. While logs are tied up in the legal battle over how much of the national forests can be cut without killing off the spotted owl, record amounts of raw timber grown on private and state land are being shipped for premium prices to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without ever seeing the inside of an American mill. `` If a log is of export quality, and is available to be exported, it will be exported,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayr </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Mayr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> mill in <LOCATION> Hoquiam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mayr </PERSON> has been reduced to counting his supply in months instead of years while watching a stream of logs being loaded onto ships in <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` We want to put out logs to the highest value market In recent years the highest value has been offshore,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, where the region's leading exporter of raw logs has started a new mill to produce metric-dimension lumber for the Japanese home-building market Companies can generally get 25 percent more for export logs than they can in the domestic market, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Boom-and-bust cycles were known to the timber industry before the spotted owl entered the spotlight, but for the first time the pinch is from a shortage of logs rather than rising mortgage rates and dips in the housing market. Eighteen years ago, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> stopped off in the coastal town of <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to see some friends on his way to college to study forest management. Now he's 37, a husband and father, and one of the 300 workers at Gold Beach Plywood who will be out of a job this summer when the mill shuts down. `` I got sucked into the mill because it was such good wages,'' <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> said. `` I kick myself in the butt now.'' Thirteen other wood products mills in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have closed this year, putting nearly 2,000 people out of work as the industry enters a new era of high-priced timber in short supply. A referendum Tuesday in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> calls for a ban on exporting state-grown logs and asks <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to make permanent an annually renewed ban on exporting logs grown on federal land. `` The mill is old and inefficient,'' said <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> mill manager <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>. `` It would take about $ 3 million to bring it up. Why should we put in that kind of investment without knowing there is a stable supply of timber?'' The shortage of timber does n't come as a surprise, but its magnitude does. In 1976, <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> forestry professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beuter </PERSON> reported that little mature timber was left on private land and that the industry would have to depend on national forests, home to most of the old-growth timber, to make it to the next century, when second-growth trees planted before World War II would be ready for harvest. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, director of resource services for <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had expected harvests in national forests to decline about 20 percent in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this year as the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> revised its long-range management plans He now fears it could drop 50 percent because old-growth forests have been ruled off-limits because of the spotted owl. `` Historically, a lot of the impetus for the management of federal lands in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was to settle the West and develop it,'' said <PERSON> Beuter </PERSON>, now a consultant in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` We are sort of at the end of that era now. We are at the point of recognizing that cutting more timber is n't going to create new cities and new economic opportunity in the West. In fact, we are coming around to where saving the forests may create new economic opportunity.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> economics professor, has been a leading proponent of the idea that the Northwest has more to gain from preserving its blue skies, green forests and clear water than from exploiting its resources. `` Most Oregonians receive two paychecks,'' he said. `` One is in dollars. The other comes from the environment. By accounting for all other amenities, I estimate that the environmental paycheck is worth $ 1.3 billion. The paycheck from the timber industry is $ 1.5 billion.'' In 1988, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> national forests supplied 5.4 billion board feet of timber, a third of the region's total harvest from all lands. Where the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> management plans used in the 1980s allowed the annual harvest of 5.5 billion board feet, the limit in the 1990s will be closer to 4.7 billion. Unlike owners of private forests, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by law may cut no more timber than it can grow back. It also has to provide for the needs of fish, wildlife, campers, hikers and water quality. Where it once had to answer only to the timber industry, the service now has a crowd of watchdogs panting over its shoulder. The governors of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> want to be sure there is enough timber to sustain the rural economy. Environmental groups demand preservation of old-growth forests. Academics have started offering new management techniques that follow the lead of nature. And there is new unrest inside the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBonis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> timber sale planner, has organized the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION>, with a mailing list of about 200. <PERSON> DeBonis </PERSON> wrote in February to <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> claiming the agency is in bed with the industry. `` The question we need to ask concerned citizens is, ` Why should the national forests be sacrificed to an overzealous and greedy industry that liquidated their own lands to make a fast cut?''' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s staff is preparing a detailed response to <PERSON> DeBonis </PERSON>' letter, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Narlock </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Maybe we need some of these things talked about It was a gutsy move on his part.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has taken a beating in the courts under the National Environmental Policy Act, evidence <PERSON> DeBonis </PERSON> cites for his argument that too many trees are being cut. While loggers tie yellow ribbons to their trucks and demand more timber, the grim truth is jobs are disappearing, spotted owl or no spotted owl. `` The biggest source of change in employment has been the modernization and automation of the forest products industry,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, who produced a study concluding the decline in timber jobs in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> has little to do with cutting old growth in national forests. <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> economist, said in the 1970s he figured each 1 million board feet of timber translated into eight timber jobs. That's now down to 1.5 jobs in the high-tech mills and four to five jobs overall. Timber is virtually extinct as a factor in the economies of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, but still vital in small cities and towns that grew up with it. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s 68,700 wood-products jobs _ almost all of them outside the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> area _ account for 5.2 percent of the state's employment <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 41,800 timber jobs account for 2.1 percent of its employment. In 1986, the most recent figures available, timber accounted for just 6 percent of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s gross state product at $ 2.5 billion and 2.2 percent of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s, at $ 1.6 billion. But <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Schallau </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION> argues timber has a greater impact than that, because it accounts for 38 percent of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s basic economy _ bringing in outside dollars _ and 18 percent of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s. While economists may differ over timber's importance, they agree the places that will be hurt worst are towns like <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, population 1,500, with a payroll of $ 6 million from Gold Beach Plywood. `` If you live in a big city you've got a lot of choices,'' <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> said, `` but if you live here you've got to work in the brush or the mill.''

 One tip that <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> is taking bold steps with its newest sawmill is the bed of pansies in the log yard. <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION>, a leading exporter of logs to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, has gone a step further to produce precision-sawn, metric-dimension lumber for Japanese home builders, for whom the appearance of wood for traditional post-and-beam construction counts more than the structural strength valued in the American market. `` We want to put out logs to the highest value market. In recent years the highest value has been offshore,'' said operations manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. So the company scrapped an aging mill in North Bend on the southern coast and converted a cedar plant here into ts mill of the'90s, called CBX. `` We're pulling out all the stops,'' said superintendent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> as he showed off the paved log yard, laser-guided saws, flowers and a new management style that emphasizes teamwork. `` We're spending $ 1 million on the upgrade. But high-tech also means fewer jobs. When <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> announced the CBX project in January, <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Bend </PERSON> employed about 200 and produced about 65 million board feet a year, about 3 jobs per million board feet. The CBX crew of 69 can produce 45 million board feet a year, or 1.5 jobs per million feet. The mills that survive the current shakeup in the industry must be extremely efficient, and <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> expects his hand-picked crew to lead the way. `` We're aiming to have this site be the model for the industry.'' To emphasize that point, <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> has installed catwalks for visitors. `` All the major Japanese trading companies have been here once or twice,'' said <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, who is learning Japanese. While <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> took the obvious steps of upgrading the physical plant at CBX, it also is going where no sawmill has gone before in its contract with the International Woodworkers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Basically, it lets people work as teams rather than in individual job situations,'' said <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Summerville </PERSON>, field representative for IWA Local 3-261. `` Sometimes you have to give something like this a trial period to see if it will work.'' Lumber grader <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Esch </PERSON> is enthusiastic about being able to rotate through three positions rather than sticking to one job. `` It's kind of like being an immigrant in a new country,'' he said. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, an 11-year veteran of the company, scored well on a hand-eye coordination test, and was cross-trained to run bark-stripping machinery and giant loaders in the yard. `` Before it's done, I expect to know how to run everything in here,'' she said. The first shift starts at 6:30 a.m., with workers and managers joining in 10 minutes of exercises, followed by as much as 45 minutes of talk as the crew helps make management decisions. To emphasize teamwork, <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> scrapped an old cleanup contract and made everyone, including <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, responsible for keeping the mill clean. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> is happy to get away from the old-style management approach he calls `` big brain-little brain.'' `` Generally you get dissatisfied employees because they are starved for information,'' he said. `` We're giving them a big piece of the operation.''

 In the rugged Illahe country where gold miners still pan creeks running into the <LOCATION> Rogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> is trying techniques from a movement known as the New Forestry. `` I see it as a major philosophical change rather than an incremental change,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a leading spokesman for the movement. `` In terms of forestry practice, it is revolutionary.'' The New Forestry is gaining credibility in the midst of debate over how much national forest can be logged while preserving the old growth ecosystem. Pressure to log these forests has increased as private lands have been overcut. `` We need to make this crisis the basis for not just resolving the issue of how much old growth to leave, but perhaps more important, how do we manage our commodity lands over the long term,'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said. `` People are looking for ways to harvest the forest and provide jobs, yet keep values that are important to the public,'' said Gold Beach District Ranger <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` The public is interested in old-growth forest, interested in the species that inhabit the old growth forest. `` We think there is an opportunity for these New Forestry techniques to provide that middle ground.'' While most national forests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> still are developing 10-year management plans, the <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> has fit the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> into its plan with a goal of balancing production against a healthy forest. The key to New Forestry is to save more of the forest's parts so what is left after logging has the best chance of surviving radical climate changes a growing number of scientists predict will come within the next 50 years. On the <LOCATION> Siskiyou </LOCATION>, the New Forestry is the basis for plans to start logging in the next couple years the 7,100 acres known as the Illahe Project, about 40 miles west of Grants Pass in southwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` As we move out from that large block of old-growth forest into areas previously harvested, we feather out the impacts,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` We'll leave a certain amount of old-growth trees per acre. That number increases as you get closer to the undisturbed block of old growth forest.'' That differs radically from traditional practice of clearcuts of 20 to 40 acres scattered throughout the forest in hopes of diluting the impact. As scientists have learned more about how pieces of the forest interact they have found that scattered clearcuts fragmented the ecosystem, breaking it into pieces too small to function. They also have found it valuable to leave corridors linking the pieces of forest. Instead of clearcutting, New Foresters will leave dead trees and some live trees standing to give animals places to feed and live. Some logs will be left to rot and restore organic material to the soil. Planners say the New Forestry will mean a 5 percent cut in timber production over the 130-year harvest cycle. No decision has been made on how to approach slash burning, in which debris left by clearcutting is burned to return minerals to the soil, reduce fire danger, and make it easier to plant seedlings, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. When it comes to replanting logged-over land, the New Forestry suggests restoring the mix of species that were cut, to maintain a diverse genetic base more able to withstand future climatic change, rather than filling the land with one commercially valuable species such as Douglas fir. <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> forestry professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, also part of the New Forestry movement, said, `` The point is that whatever you do to take trees off it has got to be consistent with the adaptations of the forest that have evolved over millenia to cope with disurbance.''

<TEXT>
 In small towns in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, where just looking at a man can get a woman labeled `` loose,'' <PERSON> Lara </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON> is being called all kinds of names for telling how it is to grow up female and Sicilian. The 19-year-old native of <LOCATION> Licata </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> _ population 45,000 _ is also selling a lot of books. Her novel `` Volevo I Pantaloni'' _ `` I Wanted Pants'' _ has been <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s best-selling paperback since early spring. <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON> wrote it at night, longhand in a notebook, in her parents' house, and submitted it in an Italian contest for young, unpublished writers. She says she did n't expect to win, let alone get published. She did both. <PERSON> Arnoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondadori </PERSON>, the Italian publishing giant, has already sold the film rights for the book, which at 121 large-type pages, is more a novella than a novel. <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON> also did n't expect insulting telephone calls and scornful looks from townspeople who felt ridiculed by the book. When she came out of her house one day with a French TV crew, paramilitary police had to protect her from a crowd shouting curses, she recalls. `` Some of my friends stayed by me. Some of them left me,'' she said in a recent telephone interview from her home. `` My sister was forced to change schools. Few of my parents' friends remain.'' The small town in her scathing story could be <PERSON> Licata </PERSON> or hundreds of other coastal towns or mountain villages in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> _ or, for that matter, the rest of rural southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Telling the story is 16-year-old <PERSON> Annetta </PERSON>. She is not an autobiographical character, <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON> says, but embraces the experiences of many of her girlfriends whose modest attempts at liberation _ like kissing a boy in public _ sometimes ended in beatings or being kept at home under even tighter supervision. <PERSON> Annetta </PERSON> wants to wear pants like men. Or at least be able wear her skirts short, like her friend <PERSON> Angelina </PERSON> who used to live in the more liberal north. <PERSON> Annetta </PERSON> asks her mother how she can get pants. `` Her reply, innocent, revolutionized my adolescent life,'' <PERSON> Annetta </PERSON> says. `` She told me, ` I pantaluna falli purtari e masculi e buttani.''' The Sicilian dialect translates: Men and whores wear pants. <PERSON> Annetta </PERSON> then sets out to learn how to put on lipstick, sway her hips so boys will notice her and lie to her parents so they'll let her go to an afternoon party _ at <LOCATION> Angelina </LOCATION>'s house, naturally _ where there are more boys than girls and no parents. At the party she meets a boy named <PERSON> Nicola </PERSON>. The next day an uncle sees Nicola kissing <PERSON> Annetta </PERSON>. She is beaten up by her father and renounced by her mother, who's so busy weeping from shame she quits cooking dinner. Wanting to eat again, her father arranges for <PERSON> Annetta </PERSON> to stay with an uncle, even though her parents know the uncle sexually molested her when she was 10 years old. `` Woman is wife, woman is mother, but she is not a person,'' <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON> writes. Most of <PERSON> Licata </PERSON>'s residents who protested the book did n't read it, she says. <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON>'s detractors became even more enraged when she went on a nationwide TV talk show and derided one of southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s most sacred rituals, the Sunday afternoon `` passeggiata,'' or stroll, taken after the day's big meal. Girls walk hand in hand, around and around the main square. Boys cluster in groups and ogle the girls, who have mastered the art of looking chaste and sexy at the same time. Older folks sit on the sidelines to make sure all the boys and girls exchange are looks. After the television show, <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON> told another interviewer the mayor met her on the street and said: `` You need to be straightened out.'' <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON> regrets blurting out on television that `` 99 percent'' of Sicilians are backward. `` I love <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. It's so beautiful, it's stupendous. But the idea that people wo n't denounce violence is wrong. ... Violence exists. ... I think it's wrong a woman ca n't go to a disco.'' In general, she says, girls are more repressed in the poorer towns and neighborhoods. <PERSON> Cardella </PERSON> says her parents were very strict with her, just `` like the others.'' `` But I tried to educate them, to make them see I was n't doing anything wrong,'' and now, she says, they support her in her battle against repression. `` People say I'm impulsive. That I want to change things too quickly. But I do n't want to wait 100 years. I do n't want to know my daughter will have the same problems I did.'' Enrolled in the literature department of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palermo </ORGANIZATION>, she studies at home and says when she marries her boyfriend, she'll move to <PERSON> Gela </PERSON>, his town, 25 miles from <LOCATION> Licata </LOCATION>.

 Many of the leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s now-quelled demonstrations for political reform have fled their homes, changed their names and appearance, and obtained false identification. Still the arrests mount, dramatizing how difficult it is to hide from authority in this tightly controlled society despite <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s huge size and 1.2 billion population <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Gang </PERSON>, the sixth student on a wanted circular of 21 to be arrested, fled to <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province just south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and introduced himself as <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shun </PERSON>, unemployed worker. But he was discovered by sharp-eyed civilians who thought his skin was too white to be the worker he claimed to be. Even in ordinary times, a fugitive can be easy to spot. In small villages, an outsider clearly stands out. In big cities, neighborhood committees staffed by women with spare time keep a close watch on comings and goings and make sure people register overnight guests with the police. Housing is cramped and many people live in just one or two rooms around a common courtyard, making it virtually impossible to hide a fugitive. Official identification is always required to travel in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but controls have been sharply increased since the June 3-4 military crackdown. Soldiers are checking identification and searching the bags of travelers at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> train station. At night, soldiers stop most cars at major intersections, check the ID of drivers and sometimes search the cars. Plainclothes police are out in strength, sometimes betraying themselves by suspicious squawks from under their clothing or too-careful inspection of passers-by. Two recently stopped a young <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> woman as she walked down the street because she resembles a wanted student leader. They let her go after checking her identification. Many work units have appointed people to take charge of security. Any newcomer looking for temporary work is likely to be scrutinized far more carefully than usual. Customs officials have been ordered to be especially alert for fugitives seeking to leave the country. This week, officials at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport arrested four people with alleged `` ties to the counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' according to Wednesday's <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily. Two of them, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoqiu </PERSON>, 27, and <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhuru </PERSON>, 29, had tickets for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. The women were caught because an official noted their passports had false border entry stamps. It turned out the passports belonged to two other women, who had left <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and mailed the passports back. But the passports lacked entry stamps, so Miss <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Lu </PERSON> allegedly faked them. The greatest threat to student activists and other protesters on the run is the intense nationwide government propaganda campaign that apparently has convinced many people the crackdown was justified. When the government called on TV viewers to help find a man accused of rumor-mongering and flashed his picture on the screen, two women quickly stepped forward to point him out. When student activist <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Fengsuo </PERSON>'s name was placed on the wanted circular, his sister and brother-in-law turned him in. Newspapers and broadcasts repeatedly have called on the public to report `` rebels,'' creating the temptation to report a neighbor and win the praise and possibly the favor of authorities. That can be important to obtaining housing and other scarce goods. Even people who might be disposed to ignore that the next-door neighbors are harboring a stranger face the pressure of knowing that if they do n't report it, someone else probably will. Then they will come under suspicion for having been silent.

 In the school year that ends next week the city's 940,000 public school students have been taught lesson after lesson about larceny, bribery, weapons possession, sexual harassment, drug abuse and political corruption Their teachers have included the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> school board members who allegedly stole a baby grand piano from a school, and the one who lived in a box near a highway; the 5-year-old student who brought a loaded pistol to school, and the 11-year-old found with $ 4,000 worth of crack in his lunch bag; the principal arrested for buying crack near his apartment and the veteran teacher arrested for snorting cocaine in a school teachers' parking lot; and the voters of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who avoided school board election polls as if they were plague wards. The students also learned something about the absurdity and futility of life when the man charged with transforming this depraved curriculum, Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, suddenly dropped dead. As the year ended, the lessons seemed to be piling up faster than anyone could master them. On Tuesday alone: _ The statewide Regents achievement test in chemistry was canceled after copies of answer sheets were stolen and hawked like baseball programs A copy even turned up on the front page of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which said it took a reporter all of 15 minutes to locate a student who would sell a copy. _ An undercover investigator reported that he was able to vote 33 times at 33 different voting sites in last month's local school board elections He simply registered under dozens of fake names. _ An appeals court reinstated a law barring school employees and political officeholders from the boards, thus voiding the election of about 18 officials Even by local standards, it was a bad year. The 1988-89 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> school calendar included: Sept. 30: Students learn they must wait a half a year _ until January _ to get some supplies, despite a program to give teachers money to speed up delivery. Oct. 25: <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, alarmed by the rising number of weapons in schools, announces plans to spend $ 2.8 million on metal detectors. Nov. 9: <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> school principal <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> is arrested by police who say he bought two vials of crack near his <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> apartment. <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON> previously had been suspended three times, and once logged 100 unexplained absences or late arrivals in a single school year. Nov. 14: A <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> school aide tells authorities she was transferred and denied a promotion because she rejected the sexual advances of a local school board member. Nov. 23: <PERSON> Green </PERSON> suspends the local school board in the <LOCATION> Morrisania </LOCATION> section of the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, citing a grand jury investigation into allegations that some board members used and distributed illegal drugs, stole school equipment and extorted political contributions from teachers, principals and other employees. Nov. 30: Newspapers report that a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> school board member lived for several weeks in a cardboard box alongside a highway, and has since disappeared entirely. She continued to receive $ 125 a month board stipend even though she had not attended a board meeting for six months. Dec. 9: An <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> school district superintendent and a school board member are alleged to have used a secret school fund to pay for personal expenses, including a `` sweet 16'' party and a Tiffany bracelet. The district was singled out by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last year as a national model. Jan. 13: A 5-year-old kindergartner is found carrying a loaded .25 - caliber pistol in the cafeteria of a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> elementary Jan. 20: Four Bronx school board members and a former district superintendent are indicted on a variety of criminal charges. One board member is charged with soliciting bribes from a textbook publisher. March 14: The head of a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> local board is indicted on charges that he sought a bribe from an acting assistant principal to allow her to hold her job after she failed an exam; an 11-year-old <PERSON> Bronx </PERSON> student is arrested after he is caught with 411 vials of crack in his lunch bag. May 2: Despite a campaign to get out the vote, only 7 percent of eligible voters turn out for neighborhood school board elections _ the lowest turnout since the elections began two decades ago. Despite reports of rampant corruption and cronyism, the vast majority of incumbents are re-elected. May 8: <PERSON> Barnwell </PERSON>'s case ends in mistrial; reassigned, he continues to draw $ 61,000 annual salary. May 10: <PERSON> Green </PERSON> dies in an asthma attack only 14 months after becoming chancellor. May 23: A third-grader at a <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> school finds 19 crack vials on a urinal. June 19: State auditors say half the complaints of corruption received by the <ORGANIZATION> central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> apparently were never investigated. As the school year ended, all of the local school boards in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> were under investigation _ two had been suspended _ as were six others around the city. One hundred and twenty-four teachers and administrators had been fired or faced disciplinary action. Statistics on school violence were still being computed.

 Seven semiconductor companies announced Wednesday they plan to join forces in an unprecedented venture to produce computer memory chips and ease the chokehold <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has on that vital market. The firms contributed `` seed money'' for the establishment of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a corporation that will make the memory chips known as DRAMs that are crucial to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> electronic and defense industries. `` It is clear that the time is right for a collective memory manufacturing venture in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to improve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s market position in what is truly a critical technology,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of the newly formed company If approved, the venture would break new ground in the federal government's attitude toward cooperation between competing companies. The government has been getting steadily more permissive toward deals that once would have run afoul of antitrust laws on the theory that concerted action is necessary to meet foreign competition. `` At this point we do n't know enough about the transaction to comment one way or the other,'' <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust division, said Wednesday. Either the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is likely to look at the deal, although not necessarily conduct a full-scale investigation, she said. The corporation's preliminary business plan calls for the completion of a plant in 1990 and high-volume production of the dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, to begin in the first half of 1991. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said the corporation's first product will be standard 4-megabit DRAMs based on design and manufacturing technology to be licensed from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The plan also says that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memories expects to raise roughly $ 500 million from companies that invest in the corporation and $ 500 million from borrowings. Memory chips are a vital link of the electronics `` food chain,'' and many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry and government officials say it is unacceptable to rely heavily on chips made in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for computers, work stations, military gear and other products. Japanese firms control nearly 80 percent of the worldwide DRAM market, which they were able to dominate by sustaining $ 4 billion in losses in 1985-86 to knock out their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> competition, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies producing DRAMs for sale on the open market, an area in which they once were leaders, fell dramatically from 11 in 1980 to three this year. The three are <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Micron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which recently re-entered the business. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> is a huge manufacturer of DRAMs, but only for internal use. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, who will be its chief executive, was formerly a vice president of industry operations for <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s General Technology Division. The companies that gave money to plan the corporation were <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Devices </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> LSI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Semiconductor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said the seven partners must stillobtain enough funds to launch the venture, successfully negotiate a technology transfer agreement with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, create a detailed business plan and get a favorable antitrust agreement `` It is absolutely clear that we'll need more than the seven we have now,'' he added. <PERSON> Kane </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Memories would work closely with <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, Texas-based research consortium that was one of the first such cooperative efforts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> makes small quantities of chips to test manufacturing processes and equipment. Contacted in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on Thursday, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest semiconductor maker, said he could not comment because `` there are too many unknown things'' about the venture. The <ORGANIZATION> Electronic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, a major grouping of semiconductor companies and other electronics makers, also had `` no specific comment'' on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> venture because `` details have yet to be known,'' a spokesman said.

 Firefighters sweating in 118-degree temperatures Wednesday contained a 935-acre wildfire that briefly threatened a national park. Residents in 85 homes were advised to evacuate at the height of the fire near <ORGANIZATION> Joshua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monument </ORGANIZATION>, which is dedicated to preservation of the gnarled desert trees, but only one building was destroyed. `` The residents had cleared the brush around their homes and if it had n't been for that clearance the homes would definitely have burned,'' said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. Temperatures reached above 100 inland and into the high 80s and 90-degree mark elsewhere, and gusty <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds hampered firefighters as they fought several other brush fires. Fire blackened 175 acres in the hills of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemente </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and 35 acres in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clarita </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Firefighters earlier doused a 300-acre blaze in <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and a 115-acre fire in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was also subject to the same hot, gusty winds and low humidity which helped fan 2,600-acre wildfire 50 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Heavy smoke from the grass fire forced closure of a 10-mile stretch of state Highway 12, authorities said. State Route 20 in the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> was closed for 30 miles while firefighters tried to contain a blaze on both sides of the highway. Two families were briefly evacuated from their homes in the farming community of <LOCATION> Denverton </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chadbourne </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Solano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>.

It later decided to allow its members to go into rehearsal until the August date. Among the issues left unresolved are fees and union coverage in smaller league theaters for the directors and choreographers.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> is leaving as artistic director of the American Ballet Theatre at the end of the 1990 season. The company's board of trustees announced the departure Wednesday, a day after <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> told them of his decision to leave. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, 41, became ABT's artistic director in September 1980. He joined the company in 1974 after defecting from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where he danced with the Kirov ballet company. `` I will have given 10 years to the company, and it has been a true challenge,'' he said. `` The dancers in the company are superb. Of all the responsibilities associated with being artistic director, I've enjoyed working with the dancers more than anything else.'' <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> said he would `` pursue other professional options'' but did not elaborate. He is starring on Broadway in `` Metamorphosis,'' a play based on <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Kafka </PERSON>'s story, and has appeared in such films as `` White Nights'' and `` The Turning Point.'' He also recently started a perfume for women called `` Misha,'' his nickname.

 <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> does n't cook here anymore, but this sleepy western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> town, captured in paint by <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> and in song by <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, celebrates its 250th birthday this weekend. Some things have changed since the days when <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> made <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION> famous to Saturday Evening Post readers. Police Chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Obanhein </PERSON>, whose visage <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> used as the model of the `` perfect <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> man'' and whose enforcement of the litter laws inspired <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s ballad `` <PERSON> Alice </PERSON>'s Restaurant,'' has retired. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> herself no longer has a restaurant. Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, captured by <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> while aiming a hypodermic needle at a bare-bottomed youngster scrutinizing his medical degrees, made his last house call in February on his 83rd birthday. But the cat and dog fountain still stands. So does the horse trough proclaiming `` utility is preferable to glamor'' and the line of cane rockers on the veranda of the Red Lion Inn. <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION>'s charm has proved irresistible to thousands of tourists, who sometimes turn Main Street into a bumper-to-bumper traffic jam. But for about two hours Saturday, <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION> will reclaim the thoroughfare for a gala parade of brass bands, Boy Scouts, floats, and more than 500 marchers. An old-fashioned picnic and fireworks also are planned. Asked to explain <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION>'s appeal, Selectman <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Charbonneau </PERSON> responded: `` The people. And the uniqueness of the area.'' <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> agreed. `` I grew up in <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION> and have spent most of my life near there,'' <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his nearby <LOCATION> Berkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> home. `` Most of the people in town are wonderful and fabulous ... `` It's a place that has retained its turn-of-the-century beauty and sense of history. It's always accommodated a wide variety of people _ artists, wealthy ambassadors, mobsters running booze during Prohibition _ but it does so very reluctantly. `` And in some ways that's just fine. When I was young I did n't understand that kind of small-town politics, but I've learned to actually like it. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, now the father of teenagers, said <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION> is `` more a town for older folks,'' adding: `` I do n't recall there being a whole lot to do for a young person and there probably still is n't. I do n't think my kids ever go to <LOCATION> Stockbridge </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, who will sing `` Alice's Restaurant'' at a July 4 concert in nearby <LOCATION> Tanglewood </LOCATION>, can still cackle gleefully in anticipation of the town's reaction to his summer plans to market T-shirts emblazoned `` with the Trail of the Garbage'' that will lead tourists on the path of his crime. `` It will be sort of our own version of the Freedom Trail -LRB- in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' he said.

<HEAD>Freedoms Symbolized by American Flag Include Right to Desecrate It</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Essay</HEAD>

 They call her Old Glory. She has flown proudly from masts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s ships, waved defiantly from her battlements, lain sadly across her coffins. For 202 years the flag has inspired _ `` Oh, say, can you see'' _ but she also has been spat on, stepped on, torn and defiled. The flag has been flown upside down in derision, not just distress; it has been exploited in advertisements, desecrated with unseemly mottoes and burned by enemies without and protesters within. It has been a political issue, a legal issue and pseudo-patriots have been accused of hiding behind it. It `` waves'' for all eternity on the airless surface of the moon. And now, the highest court in the land _ divided 5-4 _ has decreed that the freedoms symbolized by the flag protect the very people who burn it as a form of political protest. `` We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, the most senior of the justices, in the majority opinion. And Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, in dissenting, said that condoning descecration of the flag `` will tarnish its value _ both for those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.'' The case before the court involved the burning of a flag at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in 1984, in which protesters chanted `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the red, white and blue; We spit on you.'' That same year the <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant chain got some flak for lowering the American flag to half staff to observe the death of its founder, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroc </PERSON>. The difficulty the justices faced in reaching agreement mirrors the shifting of American attitudes toward the Stars and Stripes. Until the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> generation, Americans venerated the flag. A flag was burned only because it was old _ and then to spare it the indignity of being thrown into the garbage can. The burning flag, however, became a searing symbol of the dissent over the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war, serving to further polarize those who regarded the flag with awe. It was a schism that remains today. Recall the part the flag played last year in the presidential campaign. There was the suggestion by Sen. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, a Republican, that <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, wife of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate, had burned the American flag while she was an anti-war demonstrator during the 1960s. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was forced to respond that the suggestion was `` totally false and beneath contempt'' and that she regarded the flag as `` a symbol of our nation's commitment to freedom.'' <PERSON> Symms </PERSON> later admitted the story was only something he had heard and that he had no proof. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also took the heat for opposing a <LOCATION> Massachussets </LOCATION> bill to require daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in the school. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pointed to a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that said a forced pledge was unconstitutional, but it was a fine distinction that swayed few voters. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to a flag factory, and recited the Pledge of Allegiance at innumerable campaign stops. He won. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, last March, an exhibit at the <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> featured a flag positioned on the floor in front of a book asking viewers to write their opinions on `` What is the proper way to display a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. flag.'' The exhibit _ called `` How to display ` Dread' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>' ` sparked strong protests, with one woman writing: `` An artist he is not, this Dread <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. He is an unpatriotic snot. He knows not what this country is about.'' Another wrote: `` I would do anything short of killing you to stop you.'' The exhibit prompted a march on the institute with demonstrators chanting `` Hut, two, three, four; get the flag off the floor.'' The flag as a freedom-of-speech issue was strongest in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> days. In <LOCATION> Mineola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a woman was handcuffed, searched, fingerprinted and jailed for flying the flag upside down during a nationwide moratorium observance by opponents of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. She was freed by a judge who ruled her act was not defilement, but a distress signal. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> threw out the conviction of a man for displaying a flag on which he had written, `` make love, not war.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Monmouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freeholders </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> decided it would n't allow citizens to speak at its public meetings if they did n't take part in flag ceremonies that began each session. A 19-year-old resident who strolled through <LOCATION> Leominster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, with an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag sewn to the seat of his pants was sentenced to a year in jail. The law, passed in 1899, forbade treating the flag in a contemptuous manner. <PERSON> Yippie </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Abbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>, who died recently, was convicted of defiling the flag _ wearing a shirt made in the design of the flag when he showed up for a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Un-American Activities. The conviction was overturned. Passions ran so high in a southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> county that the governing board voted to require all county-owned cars to carry flag decals with the slogan `` Our Flag: Love it or Leave.'' But in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> upheld the `` defacing'' conviction of a youth who painted a white peace symbol over the field of stars. A judge who dissented said, `` patriotism is not instilled by statute.'' And the ultimate in disappointments came in 1987 to a Taiwanese company that found it difficult to sell <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags labeled `` Made in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.'' The company offered its American distributors `` Made in <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>'' labels, but they would n't bite.

<HEAD>US Skeptical of Soviet Proposal to Consult UN Council on Palestinian

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is skeptical of a Soviet proposal to seek advice from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent members on proposed elections among Palestinian Arabs on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, administration sources say `` We said we were n't interested,'' an official said late Wednesday. The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, did not reject the idea outright but said it would not get anywhere `` as far as we're concerned.'' The official said the proposal could complicate efforts to hold elections to choose <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives to negotiate self-rule with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It would only muddy the waters and distract from the -LRB- elections -RRB- idea itself,'' the official said. Participation by the council members would guarantee the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a role that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> fears would be used to the advantage of the Arabs. The five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Soviets, without committing themselves on Palestinian elections, made their proposal during a two-day meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. It was one in a series of conferences on various global problems arranged by the two superpowers. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation was headed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for the <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, head of the department's policy planning staff. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, senior expert on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, led his government's delegation. The Soviet idea was first disclosed in Thursday editions of The Star Tribune of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The elections were proposed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as a way of breaking the stalemate between the Arabs and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The idea has qualified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, provided arrangements are satisfactory to the Palestinians and the Arab countries. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has rejected <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s offer as a subterfuge to block the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is operating on the assumption that the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposal still has a chance and in any event is the only known vehicle for starting negotiations. For this reason, the official said, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal to consult the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members on a proper framework received a skeptical <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response. The official said the Soviets did not endorse or reject <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposition As in the past, the Soviets said only that it was `` worthy of consideration.'' In the past, as an inducement to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the Soviets have said they would be prepared to resume diplomatic relations once negotiations began. But the official said the Soviets did not repeat this offer in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sessions. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defeated a combination of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries in a six-day war.

 The share of first pregnancies beginning out of wedlock has risen sharply in the 1980s and single pregnant women are no longer rushing to the altar, a new <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> study shows. There has been a significant rise in the share of first births out of wedlock during the last two decades, while the share of women who tie the knot between conception and birth has been on a decline. The census report also found a jump in the birth rate among women in their 30s, noting that most women who had a baby in 1988 were in the work force. It found that minorities tend to have higher birth rates than whites and that nearly three-quarters of recent births to black women between 15 and 29 were out of wedlock. Overall, the national fertility rate was 69.7 births per 1,000 women age 18 to 44 during the year ending in June 1988, according to the report, `` Fertility of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> Women: June 1988.'' Fertility rates have remained at about 70 births per 1,000 women during this decade and the 69.7 for 1988 is not considered significantly different from the 71 recorded the year before. But the profile of women becoming mothers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has changed. For women age 15 to 29, the bureau found, 40 percent of first births were conceived out of marriage between 1985 and 1988. That's up from just more than 30 percent when the measure was first taken, between 1970 and 1974, the report said. The major change occurred among women who gave birth out of wedlock, a share which increased from 17.9 percent of first mothers in the early 1970s to 28.3 percent between 1985 and 1988. At the same time the share of unwed mothers was rising, the percentage of women who got married after they became pregnant but before they gave birth dropped from 14.9 percent to 11.7 percent of first mothers. This shift `` may reflect the opinion of some women that they may be better off in the long run by relying more on the support of their parents and relatives for financial and emotional assistance than by entering a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solely to prevent an out-of-wedlock birth,'' reported bureau analyst <PERSON> Amara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bachu </PERSON>. The share of single first mothers varied sharply by race, the study also found. Among black women, 74.6 percent of first births to women age 15 to 29 occurred out of wedlock between 1985 and 1988. That's up from 54.1 percent between 1970 and 1974. For Hispanic women the rate was 30.6 percent, up from 26.7 percent. And white women recorded 19.6 percent premarital births, up from 11.5 percent. The new report also confirmed the widely reported trend of women postponing births as they pursue educations and careers. The `` increases in childbearing among women over 30 ... suggest that childless women now more than in the past are deliberately postponing their childbearing to older ages,'' the report concluded. For women age 30 to 34 the 1988 fertility rate was 81.6 births per 1,000 women, up from 60 in 1980 and 56.4 in 1976. A similar, though smaller, increase was reported for women 35 to 39. The bureau also asked women about their plans for families and reported that, among childless wives age 25 to 29, 85 percent still expect to have a child at some point. That's up from 75 percent who expected a future birth in this age group in 1975. And among married women in their early 30s, the share who expect to have a child someday rose to 54.4 percent from 33.5 percent since 1975. Nevertheless, the study concludes, `` the question remains: How strong is the commitment to childbearing after remaining married and childless for several years?'' For women age 18 to 44, the study reported that 50.9 percent of women giving birth in 1988 were in the work force, up from just 38 percent in 1980. `` Labor force participation for among women with newborn children is appreciably higher for college-educated women than for women'' with less education, the report found. Among new mothers with college degrees nearly 60 percent were in the labor force, compared with 49 percent of high school graduates and 34 percent who had not finished high school. By race, 59 percent of black mothers were in the labor force, compared to 50 percent of whites and 37 percent among Hispanics.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Confiscate Opposition Leaders' Coffee Plantations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cracking down on its critics, the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government says it has confiscated coffee plantations and other property belonging to three opposition business leaders. The three _ <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuadra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arnoldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Aleman </PERSON> _ were linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, an opposition group, and have been sharply critical of government regulation of the coffee industry. The confiscation announcement Wednesday came three days after coffee growers from all over the country decided to pull out of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, calling the regulatory and development-oriented panel useless. An order signed by Agriculture Development Minister <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheelock </PERSON> and read on state-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaragua </ORGANIZATION> radio declared the properties of the three men of `` public utility and social interest.'' It did not mention compensation. At a meeting Sunday in <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION>, 80 miles north of the capital, coffee growers unanimously decided to withdraw from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. They said the panel, made up of government and private representatives, had ruined the industry. At the meeting, <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON> accused the government of causing a severe economic crisis through mismanagement, adding that only a `` government of national salvation'' replacing the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> could bring <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> out of recession. Coffee is one of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s main export items and a principal dollar-earner. Commenting on the confiscation order, the Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> accused leaders of the coffee growers of `` urging chaos, disorder, price gouging, smuggling and speculation'' in the industry. The properties were ordered confiscated because these leadaers `` adopted irresponsible attitude that was fomenting anarchy in the coffee industry at a time when the country is going through an economic crisis.'' In a speech Tuesday, President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said `` all anti-patriotic coffee growers will not receive a single cent'' in credit from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> accused the growers of trying to sabotage an economic austerity plan to reduce inflation, which last year topped 10,000 percent. As part of the plan, the Sandinista government earlier this week ordered a 110 percent devaluation of the cordoba currency, which sent prices of consumer goods and services skyrocketing. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, the brother of <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, called the confiscations `` an act of vengeance by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> over what happened at the assembly in <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, a former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, had some of his properties in the eastern province of <PERSON> Masaya </PERSON> confiscated by the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> some years ago. In June 1988, the Sandinista government confiscated the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> sugar plantation and mills, one of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s largest industries. Sugar is also an important export item.

<HEAD>Fresh From Democratic Kills, Republicans Turn Sights on GOP Lawmaker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 House Republicans are seeking to turn a liability into an asset with the case of <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> GOP lawmaker convicted on charges involving sex with a 16-year-old girl. The Republican conference on Wednesday made a preemptive strike, voting to force an ethics investigation of their colleague before Democrats could do the same or the ethics committee did so on its own. Now, they are looking to Democrats to spotlight some of their own colleagues as ethics violators. `` I think it's an appropriate kind of step to suggest that the other caucus ought to also be willing to do the kind of tough thing that is involved in what our conference did,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, R-Pa., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leadership Democrats do n't seem to be biting. `` There is no calculation that one can properly make that ethical problems or concerns are more emphatic in one party than another,'' said Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash. `` That's absolute nonsense, and the public knows it, and it's I think a very unfortunate attempt to try to achieve a political point, apparently at the expense of one of their own members. Newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> was more blunt: `` I'm sure Democrats are prepared to kick out their own members who are convicted of sexually abusing children.'' Republicans have sought to make ethics a primary issue in the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, hoping to capitalize politically on the allegations of ethical misconduct against former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and former Majority Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif. But the next two cases likely to come before the ethics panel feature Republicans: <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> and Minority Whip <PERSON> Newt </PERSON> <PERSON> Gingrich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, who is alleged to have set up an improper partnership to promote a book he wrote. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was convicted May 30 in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, of contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a minor, after a jury found he had sex with the girl at his <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> apartment last November. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, 58 and divorced, is appealing the conviction. Democrats believe that in political terms, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' case has in some ways been more objectionable to the public than the allegations involving <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, which involved complicated financial transactions. Local and state Republican officials in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, clearly embarrassed by <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, have called on him to resign and warned he would not be renominated to his seat in 1990. Traditionally, members convicted in court of wrongdoing are dealt with speedily by the ethics committee, which can apply sanctions ranging from a reprimand to expulsion from the House. But <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> has vowed to fight the charges, and his spokesman said Wednesday's action was welcome because an ethics probe could `` once and for all bring forth the truth about this entire episode.'' The spokesman, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was hampered in court because he was not permitted to cast doubt on the motives and credibility of the girl and her mother, who were <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' accusers. `` Now we'll be able to bring forth the background and the motives,'' he said.

 Here are excerpts from the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision Wednesday that gave constitutional protection to the burning of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag as a form of political protest. From Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s majority opinion: After publicly burning an American flag as a means of political protest, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was convicted of desecrating a flag in violation of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law. This case presents the question whether his conviction is consistent with the First Amendment. We hold that it is not. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> claims that its interest in preventing breaches of the peace justifies <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s conviction. However, no disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because of <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s burning of the flag We have not permitted the government to assume that every expression of a provocative idea will incite a riot, but have instead required careful consideration of the actual circumstances surrounding such expression. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was prosecuted because he knew that his politically charged expression would cause serious offense. If he had burned the flag as a means of disposing of it because it was dirty or torn, he would not have been convicted. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law is thus not aimed at protecting the physical integrity of the flag in all circumstances, but is designed instead to protect it only against impairments that would cause serious offense to others. Nothing in our opinion should be taken to suggest that one is free to steal a flag so long as one later uses it to communicate an idea. We also emphasize that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was prosecuted only for flag desecration _ not for trespass, disorderly conduct or arson. If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable. We can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag that waving one's own, no better way to counter a flag-burner's message than by saluting the flag that burns, no surer means of preserving the dignity even of the flag that burned than by _ as one witness here did _ according its remains a respectful burial We do not consecrate the flag by punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the freedom that this cherished emblem represents. From Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s concurring opinion: The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like. We make them because they are right, right in the sense that the law and the Constitution, as we see them, compel the result. It is poignant but fundamental that the flag protects those who hold it in contempt. From Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>'s dissenting opinion: For more than 200 years, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag has occupied a unique position as the symbol of our nation, a uniqueness that justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning in a way <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> did here. No other American symbol has been as universally honored as the flag. Both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the state have enacted numerous laws regulating misuse of the American flag. With the exception of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, all the states now have statutes prohibiting the burning of the flag. Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have. I can not agree that the First Amendment invalidates -LRB- an -RRB- act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the laws of 48 of the 50 states, which make criminal the public burning of the flag. From Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' dissenting opinion: A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and national unity. It also signifies the ideas that characterize the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the special history that has animated the growth and power of those ideas. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, of religious tolerance, and of goodwill for other peoples who share our aspirations. The symbol carries its message to dissidents both at home and abroad who may have no interest at all in our national unity or survival. The value of the flag as a symbol can not be measured. Conceivably that value will be enhanced by the court's conclusion that our national commitment to free expression is so strong that even the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as ultimate guarantor of that freedom is without power to prohibit the desecration of its unique symbol. But I am unpersuaded. The creation of a federal right to post bulletin boards and graffiti on the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monument might enlarge the market for free expression, but at a cost I would not pay. Similarly, in my considered judgment, sanctioning the public desecration of the flag will tarnish its value _ both for those who cherish the ideas for which it waves and for those who desire to don the robes of martyrdom by burning it.

<HEAD>Committee Debates Bill to Forbid Cleanup Writeoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Irate members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> are moving to ensure the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> pays the full cost of cleaning up the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill. Sen. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, D-Nev., pleaded Wednesday for fellow senators to support a law that would deny <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> a tax writeoff for expenses of cleaning up the spill, the largest in the nation's history `` I do not want to tell my constituents that the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people owe <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest polluter in history, millions of dollars in a tax rebate in return for destroying the environment and raising prices at the gas pumps,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> is chief sponsor of a bill that would prohibit <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> from deducting costs of cleaning up the spill unless the federal government certified the cleanup meets standards of the Clean Water Act or other federal laws. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday he and 61 congressional colleagues have asked the federal government to sue <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> for the cost of environmental damage to Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and the surrounding Alaskan wilderness. The congressmen said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that the government shouuld get `` a full recovery of the money necessary to restore or replace the lost resources.'' `` My interest is not simple vengeance,'' <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> said. `` It is rather providing the only genuine incentive that will ever prevent the repetition of the Valdez tragedy.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has been criticized for what some have called a slowness to respond to the March 24 spill of nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil from the Exxon Valdez tanker into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> has spent more than $ 200 million to clean up the mess, company officials said Wednesday. An undetermined portion will be reimbursed by insurance and the uninsured expenses may be deducted from taxable income as a cost of doing business. Since the top federal corporate tax rate is 34 percent, the effect will be for taxpayers to pay 34 percent of the uninsured expense. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration opposes the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill to restrain <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to write off the cleanup costs. `` The bill would violate the fundamental principle of business taxation, that a taxpayer's ordinary and necessary business expenses may be deducted in computing net income,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, told the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the nation's major oil companies, said the bill `` sends the message that whatever cleanup costs a taxpayer incurs, he runs the risk of having them denied at some future time because he does not or can not meet standards ... determined by the commandant of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> or the administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Enviromental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, said he supports <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>'s bill but ackowledged that existing environmental laws contain no objective standards for determining whether a cleanup was proper. The committee did not indicate when it will act on the bill. Also on Wednesday, the major oil companies criticized a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel's move to ban oil exploration in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and areas off the coasts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group of big oil companies, called the action `` unwise, unjustified and ultimately counterproductive to the country's energy security.'' Environmental groups applauded the proposed bans. The House Appropriations subcommittee on the interior voted Wednesday to stop oil companies from drilling in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> for one year on lease blocks purchased from the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last October. About $ 95 million was invested in the leases.

<HEAD>Toxic Chemical is No Longer Toxic, EPA Decides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With a single sweep of the regulatory hand, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has cut in half the amount of toxic chemicals that are released into the air, soil and water from industrial plants. It's not that the volume of chemical pollutants is any less, but as of today some 12 billion pounds _ nearly 54 percent of all toxic chemicals released in 1987 _ no longer are considered toxic. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday officially declared sodium sulfate as not posing health concerns that warrant it being in the company of such toxic chemicals as sulfuric acid, chlorine, lead and a variety of carcinogens. The chemical, which is widely used as an agent and byproduct in a variety of manufacturing processes including the production of paper, glass and detergents, dominated the statistics announced recently on toxic chemical releases from industrial facilities. It was the reason that chemical discharges released into water dwarfed releases into the air and soil; it was why <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was ranked as the state with by far the greatest amount of toxic chemical releases; and it was why the total volume of releases nationwide exceeded 22.5 billion pounds instead of closer to 10.5 billion pounds. The reclassification of sodium sulfate may be only the first of several such actions. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> also is reviewing whether two other chemicals high on the toxic release list _ aluminum oxide and ammonium sulfate _ should be taken off the list. Aluminum oxide accounted for 2.4 billion pounds of toxic chemical releases by industry in 1987, nearly 11 percent of the total, and ammonium sulfate accounted for 918 million pounds, about 4 percent of the total, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has proposed deleting aluminum oxide from the list, although no final action has been taken. It has not yet responded to a petition by the chemical industry to delete ammonium sulfate, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Israel </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> official involved in the petition process. Because the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has taken sodium sulfate off its toxic chemical list, companies will not have to include releases of the chemical into the air, water and soil when they produce their release statistics for 1988 at the end of this month. The chemical industry had petitioned the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to reclassify sodium sulfate, arguing that there is no evidence the chemical poses a significant health threat. The action by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had been expected. The agency staff in April had recommended that sodium sulfate be reclassified as being nontoxic `` due to an apparent absence of significant toxicity concerns'' about the chemical. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said in an interview the agency concluded that sodium sulfate `` did not meet the health or environmental toxicity criteria'' for a chemical to be on the toxic list. The absence of sodium sulfate from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> toxic chemical list _ which now includes 327 chemicals _ will result in significant changes in the national profile on toxic releases, agency officials said. For example, the state with the most toxic chemical releases was <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> with 5.8 billion pounds, more than a fourth of all the releases in the country. But most of the discharges were of sodium sulfate. With the chemical no longer classified as toxic, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> drops from being the biggest polluter to ninth, according to the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. Water discharges were the most common form of toxic chemical releases in 1987 largely because three-fourths of all releases of sodium sulfate were into surface water. Without sodium sulfate, water releases will rank far behind toxic chemical discharges into the air, which now assumes the No. 1 spot accounting for about one-fourth of all such releases from industrial plants.

 <PERSON> Harlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berk </PERSON> does n't like to think of the dusty, diminutive Egyptian mummy for sale at his downtown coin and antique shop as a body. `` It's wrapped, and I try to think of it as a piece of antiquity,'' said <PERSON> Berk </PERSON>, standing near the Plexiglas table that for a month has been the resting place for the ancient remains of a woman. `` I try to look at the artwork on the outer wrappings and not focus on the more macabre aspects.'' He's asking $ 50,000 for it, adding, `` The market will tell me if I'm right or wrong.'' He hopes to sell the mummy to a museum or university. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, archivist and Egyptologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oriental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION>, said it is illegal to export mummies from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> without <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> government permission. But until well into this century, more `` laissez faire'' rules applied. <PERSON> Berk </PERSON>, an antique dealer, said he bought the mummy from an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> family a month ago, and considers himself free to sell it at his shop. He said he was told that a family member brought the mummy back from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> about 60 years ago. The mummy, at 4-feet, 1-inch, looks smaller than lifesize as it rests on the table in a temperature-controlled room. On the front are remnants of the pinkish paint and gold leaf used for decoration, with some pictures of Egyptian gods including Horus, the god of heaven; and <PERSON> Osiris </PERSON>, the god of vegetation and later of death. The pictures tell a story of life, death and rebirth _ paths the long-dead woman's loved ones likely envisioned for her, <PERSON> Berk </PERSON> said. `` We do have respect for the individual, even though she's been deceased for several thousand years.'' <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said he understands why some are disturbed by the sale of human remains, particulary those of American Indians only a couple generations old. `` I do n't think any of us would want to see our grandparents' bodies on display in a museum,'' he said But the time and distance involved for the mysterious Egyptians seem to make viewing them less distasteful. `` Letting the rest of the world study and enjoy these things only creates greater appreciation of the Egyptian culture,'' <PERSON> Berk </PERSON> said.

 A handwriting expert examined betting slips contained in baseball's report on <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> and concluded that his handwriting is on wager slips involving <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>' games, The Associated Press learned Wednesday. In addition, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Thursday's editions that the slips have <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s fingerprints on them as well as being in his handwriting. `` Rose is claiming the sheets are forgeries,'' a federal law enforcement official, who asked not to be identified, was quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> as saying. `` He says he did n't write them but we're as confident as we could be that he did.'' The betting slips may support allegations that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who holds the major league baseball record for career hits, bet on his own team. If proven, the offense would mean an automatic lifetime ban from the game. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who has sued Commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> in state court, has maintained he never bet on baseball. His lawyers also have said that baseball's report on gambling allegations, written by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>, was based on hearsay and the word of convicted criminals. However, a source familiar with baseball's investigation told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that the betting slips _ and the expert's verification of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s handwriting on them _ give baseball tangible evidence of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s betting The handwriting expert was hired by baseball as part of its investigation. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers sued <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> on Monday in attempts to block a hearing next Monday with the commissioner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> will consider <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s request for a temporary restraining order during a hearing Thursday. The betting slips were revealed as part of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawsuit against <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> and currently are in the possession of federal authorities who have investigated <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> on tax matters. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers allege that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON>, who claims to have run bets for <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, stole three pieces of paper from the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>' manager. The papers are described as the `` Pete Rose Betting Sheets'' in <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>'s report. Baseball officials declined Wednesday to discuss the handwriting analysis. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers indicated in their court filing that they wanted an expert of their own to examine the sheets as well. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawsuit attacks the reliability of one of the betting slips. The lawsuit says the first of the three sheets `` purports to set forth a bet made on an April 9, 1987 game where <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> played at <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>.'' `` Incredibly, <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> places significant emphasis on this sheet of paper even though April 9 was an off-day for the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>, and while they played in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> the previous day, the game was in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> and not in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>,'' the suit said. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers make no mention of the other two betting slips. Lawyer <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> declined to answer any questions about the betting slips or the handwriting analysis. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, speaking after the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> lost a doubleheader to the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, was informed of the reports on the handwriting and fingerprints. `` That's not true,'' he said. `` I'm not commenting on anything like that. Any other baseball questions? I thought it was in the courts right now. I'll say it again, I'm not going to talk about it.''

<TEXT>
 The government's budget deficit is mounting at a slower pace this year than it did in fiscal 1988, due to stronger federal income tax collections so far in 1989. For the first eight months of the 1989 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the budget deficit totaled $ 113.32 billion, 11.8 percent less than the $ 128.43 billion shortfall counted at the same time last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday. Analysts say the figures suggest this year's shortfall is likely to undershoot both the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's projection for a $ 163.3 billion deficit and the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>'s estimate of $ 159 billion. For all of last fiscal year, the deficit totaled $ 155.1 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> report showed the government posted a $ 25.47 billion budget deficit last month, 12.8 percent more red ink than in May 1988 and higher than most analysts had expected. The May shortfall followed a record surplus of $ 40.57 billion in April, when government coffers were fattened by an unusually large surge in income tax payments. Last month, revenues were up 19.1 percent from May 1988 to $ 71.12 billion, while spending was up 17.4 percent from a year earlier to $ 96.58 billion. Analysts say revenues this year have been running ahead of projections due to strong personal income tax collections generated in the wake of the 1986 overhaul of the tax code. `` Even though we had slightly wider red ink in May, it does appear as if the budget for the entire year will show visible improvement over last year,'' said economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> estimated the fiscal 1989 deficit will total $ 130 billion to $ 135 billion, and said most of the improvement comes from the bulge in personal income tax receipts in April He said the surge in tax payments occurred because people shifted some of their income from 1987 to 1988 when the top tax rate dropped. Economist <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> said that although May's deficit was higher than expected, `` it looks like the trend in the deficit is working its way down slowly.'' <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> estimated the 1989 deficit would be around $ 135 billion to $ 145 billion. As usual, the government's largest spending category last month was the military. Defense spending in May totaled $ 24.33 billion and reached $ 192.96 billion for the first eight months of the fiscal year. That was up 2.3 percent from the same point a year earlier. Other large spending categories were: _ Social Security: $ 19.15 billion in May and $ 147.53 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up 5.8 percent from a year earlier _ Other programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>: $ 15.22 billion in May and $ 112.34 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up 6.9 percent from a year earlier _ Interest payments on the national debt: $ 20.06 billion in May and $ 153.67 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up 11.8 percent from a year earlier

<HEAD>Tightening of US-China Relations Won't Affect Grain Market</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain market will remain open to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> despite further tightening of relations in the wake of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s crackdown on pro-democracy forces, says <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> `` I would not see that in any way affecting the present status of agricultural transactions, either actual or potential,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told reporters on Wednesday. Earlier, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> deeply regretted <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s execution of three protesters but added that no additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action is being contemplated. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> believes the sanctions already in place are the proper response to the bloody crackdown by the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> regime and the arrests of more than 1,600 demonstrators. Asked about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s order curtailing contacts by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials with their Chinese counterparts and suspending all high-level official visits to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he did n't think that would have much effect on the agricultural trade situation. `` Not in terms of commercial transactions between the two countries,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` It certainly could have some effect on the conduct of government-to-government programs, of course, including such issues as potential Chinese membership in the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -RRB-.'' But while the commercial sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are expected to be unaffected by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s orders, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said programs for extending further credit or subsidized sales of wheat to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> are another matter. `` There is nothing in the president's statements to date, nor will there be in the future, that will affect the fundamental openness of the American marketplace,'' <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. However, when speaking about credit or the subsidy provisions of the Export Enhancement Program for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, `` that's a separate question'' and will be addressed as the situation requires, he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is expected to buy about $ 1.4 billion worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm commodities in the fiscal year that began last Oct. 1, compared with $ 613 million in 1987-88, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates. That would compare with $ 7.9 billion forecast for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s purchases, traditionally the largest, and $ 3.4 billion for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>

 Farmers continue to be the major buyers of agricultural land, according to a preliminary report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Farm owners and operators were involved in 57 percent of all farmland purchases in the year that ended on Feb. 1, the report said. Non-farmers participated in 29 percent of the sales. No further breakdown was provided, however. About 87 percent of the farmland sold was expected to remain in agricultural use at least five years after purchase, 2 percent in forestry, and 11 percent in other uses. `` About two-thirds of the sales involved credit financing, down substantially from 90 percent in the early 1980s when farmland prices were their highest,'' the report said Wednesday. The report by the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said farmland values through 1989 and early 1990 `` are expected to continue increasing at an average rate slightly above this past year's 6 percent.'' Higher farm income, lower inflation-adjusted interest rates on real estate loans, and moderate growth in inflation were cited as reasons for the forecast. One report last month predicated that farmland values could rise an average of 7 percent to 9 percent in 1989, compared with the 6 percent gain last year.

<HEAD>Study Touts Half Trillion Dollar Impact For Civil Aviation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civil aviation and related businesses pump more than half a trillion dollars a year into the nation's economy, according to an aviation industry study. The study, released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improved </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION>, says the industry contributed $ 522 billion to the economy in 1987, the latest year for which complete data is available. Since then, rapid growth has continued, with a doubling of orders for civilian aircraft, partnership officials said at a news conference. The study is part of the group's effort to convince <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and local governments of the need for more airports and other facilities to serve the growing aviation industry. Air travel has doubled since the industry was deregulated in 1978. The partnership was formed last year by airlines, airplane manufacturers, unions, local government representatives and others interested in expanding the air transportation system. The figures in the study add up everything from the manufacture of airliners to money paid for haircuts at barbershops near airports, partnership officials said. They included transactions made possible by the existence of aviation, such as purchases made at destinations by vacationers and other travelers. Officials acknowledged, however, the study does not factor in some of the negative impact of aviation, such as the cost of noise pollution abatement at busy airports or losses from accidents. The report, compiled by <ORGANIZATION> Wilbur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, says aviation and associated businesses employ 8 million people, or 7.3 percent of the nation's workforce, with a $ 155 billion payroll. The industry's contribution to the gross national product was estimated at $ 254 billion in 1987, or 5.6 percent of the total GNP. This figure does not count the haircuts and other indirect impacts of aviation the industry claims. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON>, partnership president, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the safest and most efficient aviation system in the world but more construction is needed to accommodate rapidly increasing air travel. `` The problem is that while we are building twice as many planes to accommodate twice as many passengers,'' <PERSON> Kelleher </PERSON> said, `` we are failing to build the aviation infrastructure rapidly enough to keep planes and people moving efficiently.'' He said the study is the first to cover all of the country's 16,949 civil airports, as well as airplane manufacturers, suppliers, trade associations, travel agents, retail business and air cargo The study includes a state-by-state analysis of the impact of the industry. But the conclusions for each state are identical: `` Expansion of -LRB- the state's -RRB- aviation industry and air transportation system is vital to the economic health and international competitiveness of the state.'' Aviation-related expenditures for each state are in nearly direct proportion to the state's population.

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawmakers have endorsed the notion that while men and women may have been created equal, one definitely takes longer in the bathroom. The state <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval Wednesday to a `` potty parity'' bill that would require new buildings to have as many toilets for women as for men. `` It's been suggested that if we ca n't find equity here, can we find it anyplace?'' asked Assemblywoman <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, the bill's sponsor The bill, dubbed a `` squatters' bill of rights'' and a `` back-stall method to enact an equal rights amendment,'' was approved 140-1. The dissenter, <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannon </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the Assembly's <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> minority, said women should have more toilets than men because they need more time in the bathroom.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> executed three men Wednesday and up to 17 others were condemned to die for their roles in student-led protests that challenged the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The executions in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> were carried out despite appeals for clemency by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Western leaders. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> denounced the foreign criticism. He told visiting Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Humayun </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that most of the millions of Chinese who took part nationwide in marches, sit-ins and hunger strikes for a freer society would be treated leniently `` even if they had extremist opinions.'' But <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said, `` The tiny minority of criminals will be punished according to the law.'' The meeting was the first top-level contact with a foreign delegation since the crackdown began June 3-4, when the army fired on students and supporters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to end their pro-democracy demonstrations. More than 1,600 arrests have been reported nationwide since, and the nation's highest court has urged lower courts to deal swiftly and severely with protest-related cases. So far, 28 people have been condemned to death: the three who were executed, the 17 who were sentenced on Wednesday, and eight others who were previously sentenced to death. The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> men were convicted of setting a train on fire on June 6 after it plowed into a barricade set up by protesters, killing six people. They were shot to death Wednesday after <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s highest court rejected their appeals, a spokesman at the city's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said. He said he did not know other details and refused to give his name. The national television news reported the executions, which an official at the city's Foreign Affairs office on Thursday said were carried out at an execution ground. Due to an error in translation, an official at the office was understood Wednesday to have said the three were executed before a crowd. The men were <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Guoming </PERSON>, a brewery worker; <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuerong </PERSON>, a radio factory worker; and <PERSON> Bian </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanwu </PERSON>, who was unemployed. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> radio said 45 people who `` seriously endangered public order'' were tried in front of an audience of 10,000 people in <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION> in eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province. It did not give details of their alleged crimes, but said some were given the death penalty. Others were given death sentences suspended for two years with the possibility of being commuted to life in prison, the radio reported. An editor at the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Jinan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said 17 of the 45 were given death sentences, but said he did not know if the figure included those given two-year reprieves. The public trial in <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION> and executions in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> underscored <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s emphasis on using the death penalty as a deterrent. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does not release figures on executions and not all are reported in the official media. By Western count, more than 10,000 people were executed in a period of several years after an anti-crime drive began in 1983. Death sentences usually are carried out by a bullet to the back of the head. They are sometimes commuted to life in prison but there is no record of a sentence being overturned on appeal in Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> defended <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s actions as necessary to put down a `` counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' `` When <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is in difficulties for the time being it sees clearly who are true friends and who are false ones,'' the television news quoted him as saying. The government did not immediately respond to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suspension of high-level U.S.-Chinese contacts and moves to block $ 1.4 billion in development loans to protest the crackdown. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Netherlans </LOCATION> already had frozen relations and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has suspended new development loans. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration deeply regrets the executions but was not considering additional sanctions. `` There is an important relationship which we should seek to preserve if we possibly can,'' he said. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> ordered local governments to arrange `` political ideological education'' for college students, especially those graduating this year. Its order, published in the party newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, said the main `` weapon'' in such classes should be a June 9 speech by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> that said the students has been used by anti-party plotters. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said the greatest mistake of his 10 years in power was a failure to educate students and the public. Local radio in the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> said some students there still were organizing illegal activities and were ordered to stop and confess to police. No details of their activities were given. Officials at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> airport said they arrested four people described as fugitives linked to the protests. Officials in <LOCATION> Hebei </LOCATION> province just south of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said they had arrested 44 fugitives, including two <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> two student activists. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> officials said 65 people surrendered there, including 42 student and citizen activists. They said some, after `` seeing the light,'' informed on others. Canadian Charge D'Affairs <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhavernas </PERSON> protested to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> over an apparent attempt by plainclothes police to seize Canadian reporter <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and Mail, said three men who did not identify themselves on Monday tried to push her into an unmarked car but gave up when she resisted and a crowd gathered. She called the attack police harassment. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has banned most foreign reporting activities in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and expelled six foreign reporters in the past two weeks for allegedly violating the rules.

<HEAD>Experts Decry Scare Over Pesticides, Point to Benefits</HEAD>

 Americans stand a greater health risk from eliminating fruits and vegetables from their diets than they do from pesticide residue on the produce, food researchers told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Agriculture subcommittee. `` The real issue is the risk of pesticide use as compared to other risks in the food environment,'' <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, dean of the school of biomedical sciences at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. He said food experts agree the risks of exposure to the low level of pesticides found on food are significantly less than those associated with the pests they kill. Moreover, he said, `` there is the question of the risk of reducing fruit and vegetable consumption in response to these concerns -LRB- about pesticides -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was among 10 witnesses called before the subcommittee on domestic marketing, consumer relations and nutrition. Subcommittee members said they wanted to reduce public fears about chemical residue on food. `` As a result of the Alar and Chilean grape stories of early spring, consumers lost their trust in the safety of fresh fruits and vegetables generally,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, D-Ga., subcommittee chairman `` Ninety-nine point nine percent of the food we have gets blacklisted because of the 0.1 percent that is bad,'' <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, complained. <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said it was ironic that consumers have cut back on fresh fruit and vegetable consumption even as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> has recommended people should eat more plant foods. Dr. <PERSON> Sushma </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, of the academy, said a study issued in March recommends that people eat five or more one-half cup servings of a combination of vegetables and fruits every day, especially green and yellow vegetables and citrus fruits. She said extensive studies around the world have shown that people who regularly eat a lot of plant foods have low risk of hardening of the arteries of the heart, which is the leading cause of death in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The reason for this finding is not fully known, although the low-fat content of these foods is clearly beneficial,'' said <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> said there is not much information on whether eating foods that have been sprayed with pesticides cause disease, but `` limited data in humans thus far suggest that no adverse effects result from the ingestion of small amounts of these agents in foods.'' `` Furthermore, our committee determined that the potential small increased risk of these somewhat uncommon tumors that might result from increased exposures to pesticides in the general population would be greatly outweighed by the potential benefits to be expected from greater fruit and vegetable consumption,'' she said. Another House subcommittee and one in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are gathering testimony on legislation that has been introduced to strengthen the standards the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> uses to determine what chemicals could be used in pesticides. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION>' Council on the Environment, called the reaction to Alar on apples that led the manufacturer to remove it from the market `` absurdly inflated national panic'' that he did not want to see duplicated in legislation. He said growers need to have a range of pesticides to choose from as they move away from chemicals. `` The sort of trial by media and marketplace that we have just observed is devastating to the effort to achieve environmentally sound methods of production,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` If this trend continues, growers will begin to choose chemicals according to vague anticipation to the public will.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, turning thumbs-down on the first proposed tax increase of the year, is using a deficit-reduction bill to increase spending for social programs. The package includes higher spending for welfare and children's services and authority for Social Security recipients to earn $ 360 more next year and $ 240 more in 1991 before losing a portion of their benefits In a second day of work on a catchall package Wednesday, the committee rejected a recommendation from its human-resources subcommittee and defeated a proposed increase in the employers' tax that finances unemployment compensation. The vote in a closed-door session was 18-17 against the increase, with Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the committee, voting on the losing side The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had expressed solid opposition to the tax increase, which would have cost employers $ 10.6 billion over five years at the federal level and automatically boosted their state taxes as well. Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, acting chairman of the subcommittee that proposed the increase, said he will not give up the fight for the boost and an attached improvement in jobless benefits. He told reporters the committee was simply signaling opposition to any kind of tax increase at this point in the budget negotiations. The committee voted to raise by a total of $ 600 over two years the annual amount Social Security recipients may earn without losing part of their benefits. The new limits: $ 9,720 in 1990 and $ 10,440 the following year. For each $ 3 earned above those levels, the beneficiary would lose $ 1 of Social Security. The bill does not affect the lower earnings limit that applies to retirees 62, 63 or 64. That ceiling will rise under current law from $ 6,480 this year to $ 6,840 next year. Persons 70 and older also would be unaffected; they could continue to earn an unlimited amount without losing any pension benefit. The committee also agreed to raise a special Social Security minimum benefit for retirees who worked long years at low wages. The net effect would be to increase to about $ 5,676 the special $ 5,256 minimum benefit for a person who worked 30 years and retired at age 65. While the minimum-benefit increase would help only the poorest recipients of Social Security, the boost in the earnings limit would help those at the other end of the income scale. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> estimates that in 1986 only 10 percent of the people between 65 and 69 and eligible for Social Security gave up a part of their pension because of the earnings limit. More than 40 percent had total income over $ 42,000. Under present law, a person age 65 through 69 may earn up to $ 8,880 and still draw a full Social Security benefit. For each $ 2 earned above that level, the worker must give up $ 1 in benefits; starting next year the giveback is only $ 1 for every $ 3 earned above the maximum. Other parts of the package approved Wednesday would increase slightly benefits under the Supplemental Security Income program for poor and disabled individuals; boost grants to the states for such social services as Meals on Wheels, and raise spending for foster care. The legislation would strip the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. The new independent agency would be governed by a three-member board appointed by the president; an executive director named by the board would oversee day-to-day operations.

<HEAD>Vets' Programs Threatened as Emergency Bill Locked in Limbo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An emergency spending bill <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been debating since April has run into new trouble that threatens to cause cuts in some veterans' programs as lawmakers prepare to leave for their Fourth of July holiday. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in a surprise 218-201 vote, sent the bill back to committee Wednesday. House leaders immediately asked the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to hold new talks in search of a compromise acceptable to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrats. With warnings of service cuts at veterans' hospitals and with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> scheduled to begin a two-week recess on Friday, there was increasing pressure on <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to complete the task and leaders searched for another way to keep veterans programs running while other subjects continued in dispute. The key dispute is over an $ 821 million drug law enforcement amendment which <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats were trying to push past the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has threatened a veto. By beating the $ 3.5 billion emergency spending bill in an early procedural vote, Republicans were able to avoid voting on the anti-drug spending, which is opposed by the president as wasteful despite its political popularity. All but five Republicans voted against the bill and 52 Democrats joined the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers, partly because of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> memo highlighting pork barrel spending in the measure. The tally was a surprise defeat for the newly installed <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership. Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had confidently predicted they would prevail. `` There are going to be times when the unexpected occurs. We will have our ups and downs,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Whip <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, D-Pa., who said leaders had not pressured Democrats to keep in line The bill, under congressional budget rules, is supposed to provide money only for `` dire emergencies'' which the government must attend to before Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year. There is no disagreement over the largest single item, $ 1.2 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to cover a shortfall in money for medical care, compensation and pensions, and in other areas. Congressional leaders Wednesday night began exploring a short-term bill for only veterans' programs to prevent major disruptions, according to Democratic and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> aides who spoke on condition they not be identified. Final details were still being worked out, but such a bill would carry the Veterans programs through July 22, giving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> extra time to iron out the drug and other disputes, the aides said. Nearly $ 900 million would be added to the federal guaranteed student loan program, $ 342 million to cover the cost of fighting last year's widespread forest fires, and $ 423 million for foster care and adoption. The food stamp program would be increased $ 225 million, aid to the unemployed $ 90 million, and refugee assistance 100 million. However, influential lawmakers also used the must-pass legislation as a vehicle for cherished spending projects for their constituents. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, included $ 75 million to rebuild a radiotelescope in his The White House said Wednesday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would sign the bill, even with most of those constituent projects, if the drug money were left out and some budget gimmicks which threatened future excess spending were deleted. The gimmicks included moving the dates on paychecks for some federal workers up one day, so the money would count against this fiscal year instead of fiscal 1990. Another accounting change would allow <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to dodge agreed-upon spending limits for housing and related agencies.

 Soldiers armed with blowtorches cut up the gun barrels of battle tanks while other troops ripped the frames apart to demonstrate how serious this country is about disarmament. `` This is not an empty show put on for the world's benefit,'' Col. <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolaus </PERSON> said Wednesday during a tour for Western journalists. `` We are holding true to the intention to destroy these weapons, and you are witnesses to the fulfillment of this pledge.'' Officials showed reporters some of the 600 medium-sized tanks the government says it plans to dismantle as part of a unilateral decision to trim its conventional arsenal. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in January announced it was reducing its armed forces by 600 tanks, 10,000 troops and 50 combat aircraft. It plans to complete the cuts by next year. According to East German figures, the country's armed forces have 3,140 battle tanks. Nicolaus, commander of the two bases along <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s southeastern border with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, said more than 130 tanks had been brought to the site to be scrapped or converted for civilian use About 150 of the 36-ton tanks will be modified for use in heavy industry, mainly in the nation's coal mining operations, said Col. <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdmann </PERSON>, a military spokesman. He said the remaining 450 Soviet-type T-55A tanks will be destroyed. Some spare parts and sophisticated equipment will be salvaged, he said. Reporters saw more than 11 tanks in various stages of demolition at the first base near <LOCATION> Charlottenhof </LOCATION>. Huge cranes lifted the tanks' six-ton turrets from their armored frames, dumping them in neat rows where soldiers stripped them of their inch-thick, anti-radiation interior coating. Other soldiers removed machine guns while their comrades used acetylene torches to cut 15-foot-long, 100mm gun barrels into small pieces. At the second installation near the town of <LOCATION> Ostritz </LOCATION>, soldiers were busy in workshops melting down machine guns and breaking up the thickly armored tank bodies into small chunks. The Ostritz facility finishes the job begun near <LOCATION> Charlottenhof </LOCATION>. Piles of metal and other tank parts were scattered across both compounds. Near a jumble of former gun carriages, a sign read: `` Cannon Junk.'' <PERSON> Erdmann </PERSON> said most of the tanks were five to 15 years old. `` We're not just throwing out ancient clunkers,'' he said. `` These tanks still have a lot of mileage left in them.'' <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> <PERSON> Windisch </PERSON>, a 19-year-old soldier from the industrial city of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>, said he had mixed emotions about the demolition. `` You put a lot of work in keeping these tanks in combat shape and you develop an affection for them, the same as people get attached to cars,'' said <PERSON> Windisch </PERSON>, wiping perspiration from his brow after removing armor plating from the inside of a gun turret. `` But I grew up in a time of peace and I do n't want to see war. I'm glad we're getting rid of some weapons.'' Commandant <PERSON> Nicolaus </PERSON> said he had seen some difficult moments among crews selected to consign their tanks to the junk pile. `` I've seen tank commanders stroke the sides of their machines with tears in their eyes,'' he said. `` That was their tank and they did n't want to part with it.''

<TEXT>
 Celebrated novelist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> says he is bowing out of the presidential race in this troubled Andean nation, blaming political wrangling within the center-right coalition that has been backing him. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, the front-runner for March 1990 elections and among <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s leading writers, made his decision known in a letter to leaders of the two principal parties that comprise his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> coalition. Also Wednesday, the government for the first time appealed for foreign help to fight Maoist Shining Path guerrillas, whose latest ambush the military said left 15 soldiers and 20 rebels dead in a cocaine-producing jungle region. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, 53, criticized the `` mediocre and petty'' motives of some within his coalition to raise their own interests above those of the nation. In his letter, read during a television broadcast, <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> said he was withdrawing because of the rivalry between former President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Belaunde </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and former <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedoya </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Belaunde </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bedoya </PERSON> had been unable to agree on how to proceed in November municipal elections. Each party wanted to field its own candidates, but <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> argued that would divide the coalition. This `` has obliged me to renounce my candidacy for the president of the republic,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> said. `` The collapse of the Front could open the door in our country to totalitarian Marxism or a bloody military adventure,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruchaga </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, one group in the coalition, said the decision appeared to be `` irrevocable,'' but added, `` We are going to mobilize public opinion so that <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> is a candidate.'' Another leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>'s resignation appeared to be aimed at achieving undisputed leadership of the Front. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, who once described himself as a `` specialist in fantasies, in dreams,'' began his candidacy just 18 days ago in the southern city of <LOCATION> Arequipa </LOCATION>, his birthplace. He was catapulted into the political arena after organizing a huge rally against populist President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s plan to nationalize the banks. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s 4-year-old government is beset by an economic crisis, triple-digit annual inflation and the Shining Path insurgency, now in its ninth year and plaguing much of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> is prohibited by law from running for re-election and his party's presidential candidate, former Finance Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alva </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, is given little chance of winning because of voter discontent with <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>. Nearly 15,000 people have been killed in the conflict with Shining Path, including rebels, police, soldiers, public officials and highland peasants. In addition to the soldiers slain in the jungle, <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas this week assassinated the mayor of a northeastern tourist town and killed five ex-soldiers traveling on a bus in the Andean highlands, authorities said. The mayor, a member of <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Aprista </ORGANIZATION> party, was the 46th killed in the last two years by guerrillas.

 Fourteen babies have died of dehydration since the beginning of May in a hospital that ca n't afford air conditioning in its pediatric ward Little relief is in sight from a heat wave that began last week and has sent many looking for medical help. Patients at <ORGANIZATION> Juarez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> sometimes find conditions inside almost as unbearable as outside. On Wednesday, more than a dozen infants being treated for dehydration endured the heat of the non-air conditioned, two-room pediatric ward as the temperature outside climbed to 105 degrees. `` It's unforgivable to have our children without air conditioning,'' hospital director <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurado </PERSON> said as he wiped sweat off the forehead of a baby. `` Many times, they get worse when they get here.'' <PERSON> Jurado </PERSON> said the staff Juarez General, where the 14 infants have died, remains committed, but can do little about the heat because the hospital simply ca n't afford air conditioning. People have been reporting heat-related medical problems all over the sunbaked city. Red Cross officials said they are treating about 24 cases of dehydration a day and the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> reported it has admitted 137 patients suffering from heat-related illnesses since the beginning of May. Most cases of infant dehydration are coupled with severe diarrhea, a leading cause of infant death in the Third World. Temperatures have topped 100 degrees daily since late last week, and a high of 100 was expected today. Because the desert skies remain cloudless and humidity drops to the single digits or teens during daytime, there is nothing in the air to diffuse the sun's oppressive rays <PERSON> Jurado </PERSON> said parents often make the mistake of waiting too long to take their children to the hospital. `` People wait until the child is agonizing before bringing him here,'' the doctor said. `` They come to us in serious condition, and many times there is little we can do.'' Officials in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> and Juarez are urging people to remain indoors from noon to 5 p.m. and drink lots of nonalcoholic beverages.

<HEAD>Pentagon Officials Stresses Survivability of Long-Range Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official, boosting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to build both the Midgetman and MX missiles, told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> some of the land-based nuclear missiles deployed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be able to survive a sudden nuclear attack The statement by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON>, the undersecretary of defense for policy, was hailed Wednesday as a step forward by congressional leaders who have criticized the president for failing to make a stronger case for his two-missile plan. `` Our land-based missile deterrent program is now being designed with the president's proposal to basically have a deterrence against both a ` bolt-out-of-the-blue' attack as well as a first strike,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> In arguing for the two-missile plan, <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON> said survivability is a consideration in all parts of the so-called nuclear triad: the combination of land -, air - and sea-based nuclear `` If some of our ICBMs were survivable, this would provide, among other things, a hedge should vulnerabilities emerge in the bomber or submarine legs, and in conjunction with the alert bombers and at-sea SSBNs, the strongest possible deterrent against Soviet pre-emptive strike,'' <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel. He acknowledged deterrence has been the center of the debate over modernization of land-based missiles for almost two decades. The administration concluded after a recent review that some of each portion of the triad must be survivable as part of that deterrent. The nation's bombers and submarines meet that goal and the emphasis is now on land-based missiles, he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is looking to protect land-based missiles in silos against a Soviet strike during a crisis or even a conventional war and from a sudden attack in the absence of any hostilities. Other missiles would be mobile. <PERSON> Wolfowitz </PERSON> also told the panel verification and funds for the two missiles are necessary before the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can reach a treaty agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to limit mobile missiles. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told congressional leaders Tuesday he was willing to abandon the mobile-missile ban at the negotiating table in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> if it would strengthen his chance of winning congressional approval for his two-missile plan. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in April proposed spending $ 1.2 billion in fiscal 1990 on moving the existing multiple-warhead MX missiles from silos to railroad cars and another $ 100 million on the single-warhead Midgetman. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision Tuesday received a favorable response from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, as did his decision to increase funds for the Midgetman by about $ 1 billion. While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has tempered the opposition to the two-missile plan, complaints about the B-2 stealth program are growing in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. At about $ 500 million a copy, the radar-evading is the most expensive in history. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> raised the issue with Gen. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff, saying the problems with the earlier B-1, budget constraints and concerns about `` not flying before we buy'' have contributed to the opposition. <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> argued that if the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> attempted flight tests of three or four planes while shutting down production, the cost of the aircraft would increase significantly. `` Delaying production would cost $ 3 billion for one year,'' <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> has already proposed pushing back production of the stealth bomber a year to 1993 and cutting almost $ 4.1 billion from fiscal 1990 and 1991 budgets for the plane.

<HEAD>Home Mortgage Program Losing Money, Adding to Deficit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government officials say millions of dollars in losses in the government's largest program for insuring home mortgages are probably a `` temporary aberration'' that will improve as the housing market shores up. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which insures $ 247 billion worth of mortgages under its program for single-family homes, lost $ 369 million in fiscal year 1988, which ended Sept. 30, and $ 149.5 million in the first six months of fiscal 1989, ended March 31, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>'s parent agency. The net worth of the fund for the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>'s most popular insurance program, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund, fell from $ 3.4 billion at the end of fiscal 1987 to about $ 2.8 billion at the end of 1988 and has declined below $ 2.7 billion so far in 1989, according to a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> financial officer who spoke Wednesday on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official termed the losses a `` serious situation,'' but said the fund was not in danger of exhausting its net worth, which would require <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to step in and rescue the self-supporting program. `` There's nothing we see at this stage that would put us in that position short of an absolutely severe regional downturn for a sustained five-to-six-year period,'' the official said. Mortgage defaults, particularly in southwestern states suffering from a depressed oil industry, have largely helped fuel the losses, according to government officials. The official predicted continuing, although diminishing, losses the rest of this year and in 1990, with profitability returning in 1991. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duquette </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' auditing wing, said <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> has examined the situation and `` I'm not so sure the public needs to be overly concerned We think it's probably a temporary aberration.'' He said <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> holdings are well diversified with mortgages from all regions of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, both ailing and healthy. `` What we have here is not a savings and loan crisis,'' he said. A report in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which quoted <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> officials as saying the agency had only enough money to cover five months of claims, is incorrect, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Glavin </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. However, <PERSON> Duquette </PERSON> said the losses are a matter of concern for federal budget writers even if they do not threaten the mortgage program's net worth. When the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> has a cash outflow _ because it pays out more for insurance claims than it collects in fees _ that adds to the budget deficit. Conversely, when housing markets are hot and the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> is underwriting a lot of mortgages, its fee income jumps and it actually helps to reduce the budget deficit. That happened in 1987 when the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 101 million, according to the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> official. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which tracks <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> finances on a somewhat different accounting basis from what the agency uses, showed a cash outflow of $ 452 million in fiscal 1988, according to a report it issued last month. The agency plans to issue a complete <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> audit for 1988 in about a month, <PERSON> Duquette </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> attributes the recent outflows to the cyclical nature of the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION>'s business, said <PERSON> Duquette </PERSON>. The residential housing market peaked nationally in 1986 and 1987 and so did insurance premium income. Unlike private mortgage insurors, the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> collects all of its premium up front in a single fee, rather than collecting it monthly over the early years of a mortgage. Also, defaults generally peak two to three years after a mortgage is written so the <ORGANIZATION> FHA </ORGANIZATION> is just now experiencing the after effects of its 1986-87 bulge in business, which fell by 50 percent between 1987 and 1988. Defaults, according to budget documents, are expected to leap from $ 2.9 billion in 1986 to $ 6.6 billion this year.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges, Stocks Slip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar continued its slide against the Japanese yen on Thursday while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> inched down. The dollar ended the day's trading at 141.40 yen, down 3.55 yen from Wednesday's 144.95-yen finish. The currency opened at 141.75 yen and fell further while fluctuating between 140.35 yen and 141.75 yen. The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 111.81 points Wednesday, lost 20.31 points, or 0.06 percent, finishing at 33,324.97. The index, which moved higher during the morning session, suffered a setback in the afternoon. Dealers said the index fell as profit-takers sold issues, while others stepped off to the sidelines in the absence of market-affecting incentives. A trader said the market, which suffered consecutive losses last week, has not fully recovered its strength. In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's decline followed sharp overnight retreats on overseas markets. <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the majority of investors have lost confidence in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unit after recent market movements. `` Some trust investment companies and foreign investors bought the dollar when it approached 140.25 yen, but many participants sold it to reduce the amount of the currency at hand,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON> said the market sold the dollar to avoid losing profits, while watching how far the currency can fall to determine the market direction. `` Nothing has changed in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy, so the dollar would eventually return to its previous level, somewhere around 130 yen,'' she said, `` The market thinks this is what the central bank also intends.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted a central bank official as saying it is `` desirable'' for the yen to be a bit higher against the dollar to forestall inflation. Attributing the yen's surge to dollar-selling by speculative investors in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, the official said the yen's further rise will help correct the trade imbalance between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> reportedly intervened in the market Thursday to sell the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency to keep it lower against the yen. Neither the action nor the amount were confirmed because the central bank does not comment on its monetary activities.

<HEAD>Cable Industry Has Become Monopoly, Senator, Others Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A few major cable television operators are now the `` godfathers'' of the industry, exacting tribute from start-up companies and withholding programming from rural viewers, a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel was told. An increasingly prosperous cable industry has raised prices and stiff-armed microwave and home satellite dish companies that need programming, while growing into a `` cable Cosa Nostra'' that can do as it pleases without fear of regulation or competition, Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., said Wednesday Since 1986, when a 1984 law deregulating cable was fully in place, only about six new cable program networks have been successful, and they all are at least partially owned by major cable system operators, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> communications subcommittee hearing on ownership of the cable TV industry. In the wake of deregulation, `` We have witnessed an extraordinary concentration of control and integration by cable operators and program services, manifesting itself in blatantly anticompetitive behavior towards those who would compete with existing cable operators for the right to distribute services,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is making violent crime a nationwide investigative priority to counter a 40 percent increase in such offenses in the 1980s, Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> says.

While state and local police still have jurisdiction to investigate the vast majority of violent crimes, Sessions said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> can expand its role in this area.

<TEXT>
 A 10-year-old girl whose mother went to jail to keep her hidden after the child alleged she was sexually abused by her father has been placed in her father's custody. Under the judge's ruling Wednesday, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> will share joint physical custody of the child effective July 9. The girl will be with her father four days a week and with her mother the rest of the week. <PERSON> Lalonde </PERSON> was given sole legal custody. <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON>'s attorney, said an appeal was planned, adding: `` It's certainly a unique decision for a case of this nature.'' The couple's fight over custody of their daughter, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>, went to trial in May 1988 before <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Probate Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. A central issue was whether <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> was abused by her father. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> claimed the child had been abused by him. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> has denied sexually abusing his daughter. The judge ruled Wednesday no sign of sexual abuse existed as <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> has claimed. The ruling gives <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> sole legal custody to determine such matters as where <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> attends school and her day-to-day care. <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> asked to see both parents regularly and a schedule of visits has been worked out. `` The idea is to give <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> as much access as possible,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGangi </PERSON>, <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON>'s lawyer. His client, he said, `` is elated.'' Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> must report to a probation officer every day that <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> is in her care. The judge also ordered that <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> continue sessions with a therapist treating her for more than a year. Ms. <PERSON> Herr </PERSON> said an appeal would be based on claims the ruling is `` against the weight of the evidence of the case.'' <PERSON> DiGangi </PERSON> said an appeal would be unfortunate. `` We're sorry that <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> wishes to continue on the litigation,'' he said. `` It's time for <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> to enjoy her childhood, while she has it.'' The case drew national attention in 1987 when Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> spent six months in the <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION> state prison for women rather than disclose her daughter's whereabouts. The wrangling over <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> began three years after the LaLondes' 1983 divorce when Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> accused her ex-husband of abusing their child during visits A probate judge investigated the matter then and decided the allegations were baseless. Rather than allow <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> to have custody of his child in June 1986, the mother and child fled the state. They settled in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. But in March 1987, Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> returned alone to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to settle the custody matter. When Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> refused to say where <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> was, a judge held her in contempt of court and ordered her imprisoned until she would disclose the child's location. The woman was freed only after a baby sitter in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, tipped off police that the child was being sheltered by an underground network of women. In October 1987, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> was returned to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and placed in the custody of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. After she was examined and interviewed at <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, the child was placed with a foster family.

 A protester whose flag-burning conviction was overturned by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> called the ruling an important victory and his lawyer said it was not the insult some patriots claim. But the Korean veteran who retrieved the fragments of the burned flag said the court's ruling left him grieving. `` Some do not respect the country and the flag, its symbol,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. The high court, voting 5-4, threw out the conviction of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, who was sentenced to a year in jail and fined $ 2,000 for burning the flag in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The court said the flag-burning at a demonstration in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> during the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form of expression protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech. `` I think it's an important victory ... that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was forced to back off,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I think they got in a situation where it was too exposing of their whole professed belief in freedom of expression. `` I've talked to thousands about the issues involved in this case,'' he said. `` Many of them do n't think burning the flag is the most effective form of protest, but they were disgusted that the very government that wrapped <PERSON> Ollie </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the flag to commit all sorts of horrendous crime is now going to slap his wrist and was attempting to jail an anti-patriot revolutionary. `` I do n't consider myself an American,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm not. I'm an internationalist, a proletarian internationalist.'' His lawyer, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said veterans should be encouraged by the ruling because it shows that values fought for in the Bill of Rights are intact. `` The flag is important and if that is what people believe, then they should fly it,'' said <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>. `` That is the way that they affirm their belief in it.'' Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law that bans conduct leading to breaches of the peace is unaffected by Wednesday's ruling. But <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said it violates constitutional free-speech guarantees to ban flag burning at political rallies or protests merely because the destruction of the flag offends some people or because the state wishes to preserve the flag as a symbol of national unity. But <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the ruling has n't changed his opinion. `` I have n't mellowed any,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a 61-year-old retired engineer from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION>, said in a telephone interview. `` But I am convinced now that they can burn the material, but not burn the spirit. So it is just the body they may kill, but they will not kill the soul.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said he was in the City Hall area the day of the flag burning. He gathered the fragments of the flag and buried them. The West Point graduate later received a letter of thanks from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It was uncalled for, and I still do not know what they were protesting,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. `` If they were interested in exercising their freedom of speech, they should jolly be well be able to talk and identify what it is that they were protesting.''

 A teen-ager challenging a law that suspended his driving privileges for dropping out of school has his license back, but only temporarily. His lawyer intends to appeal the case to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if necessary. <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zakaib </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Wednesday gave attorneys for both sides 15 days to file documents supporting their cases. The judge said 17-year-old <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Means </PERSON> can drive for 30 days while the attorneys compile more information and the court studies the case. Means, a married <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> teen-ager who dropped out of the ninth grade last year, has appealed a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION> decision to suspend his license under a first-of-its-kind law aimed at reducing the state's dropout rate. Under the measure passed by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Legislature last summer, students younger than age 18 who miss more than 10 consecutive days of school or have 15 unexcused absences must give up their driving privileges. `` I did n't think in the long run that he was going in our favor,'' Means' lawyer, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Butch </PERSON>, said of the judge. But the attorney added: `` I fully expect to appeal this to the -LRB- state -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, and all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if necessary because frankly this law is ridiculous.'' After calling the judge's ruling fair, Means said he was somewhat disappointed with the outcome. `` He ca n't just let me drive and then not let me drive. It should be a yes or no answer,'' Means said. `` I think they're trying to pressure me, to force me to enroll in a -LRB- high school equivalency -RRB- program. I do n't like being forced to do anything.'' <PERSON> Butch </PERSON> argued that the law was in conflict with another state law permitting students to drop out of school at age 16. The license suspension, he said, was condemning the teen-ager and his family to poverty because he was unable to earn the money he needed to support them without a driver's license. Means' 16-year-old wife, <PERSON> Tonya </PERSON>, who is expecting a child in August, also had her license suspended because she is a dropout. Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who represents the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION>, argued that revoking the decision to suspend Mean's license would send the wrong message to other teen-agers. `` It will encourage those people who want to avoid their responsibility to the state and to themselves,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Therese </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> testified that since the law went into effect in the fall, 1,800 dropouts had returned to the classroom. Of that number, 50 percent were still attending school in March. In recent years, the state's dropout rate was about 17 percent, or 5,000 students, she said. The state expected to reduce the rate this year by 1,000 students as a direct result of the law, she said. Several states, including <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> signed a dropout bill into law Friday, have passed similar legislation and others are considering such laws.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing newspapers to identify rape victims in some instances is unlikely to change voluntary policies against doing so, a newspaper executive said. The court ruled 6-3 that The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> weekly newspaper, does n't have to pay $ 97,500 to a rape victim whose name was published in 1983. Wednesday's ruling limits states' power to punish the reporting of truthful information that is lawfully obtained. Many news organizations, including <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>, voluntarily withhold names of victims of sex crimes. The newspaper's lawyers said the woman's name was published inadvertently. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzel </PERSON>, managing editor of The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, said he did n't think the decision will change what newspapers do He pointed out that the American press has become more sensitive to privacy issues in recent years. `` I think all this really does is say you've got to make the judgment yourselves,'' said <PERSON> Weitzel </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The committee filed a court brief on the side of the Star. `` It was a pretty straightforward win,'' <PERSON> Weitzel </PERSON> said. `` It bascially says, yes, you can go after a newspaper based on privacy, but it must be on very narrow grounds.'' The justices ruled that a state can punish the publication of lawfully obtained information `` only when narrowly tailored to a state interest of the highest order.'' That interest was not present in the Star's case, the court found. Allowing censorship for an interest of `` the highest order'' will have little practical application because that terminology previously has been used only for national security matters, said attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahdert </PERSON>, who represented the Star. `` It raises the fundamental question of whether a privacy issue could ever be an interest of the highest order,'' <PERSON> Rahdert </PERSON> said. He said the ruling could have a wide ranging effect against attempts at censorship. The victim's lawsuit was based on a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law that outlaws printing, publishing or broadcasting the names of sex crime victims. <PERSON> Weitzel </PERSON> said the editors' group has long questioned the constitutionality of the law. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Franks </PERSON>, assistant deputy state attorney general, said he was uncertain what impact the court's decision would have on the law. `` We would urge, in the interest of protecting the victims of crime, that the news media continue to adhere to their policy of not publishing the names of rape victims,'' <PERSON> Franks </PERSON> said. Star publisher <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said he was pleased with the ruling but regretted the award was n't reversed by state courts. `` We were being denied -LRB- the right -RRB- to publish the truth,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` It constituted prior restraint.'' The rape victim's name had been obtained from a report posted, apparently by mistake, in the press room of the <ORGANIZATION> Duval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Had the court allowed the award to stand it could have lead to passage of laws to prevent the publication of victim's names in other types of crimes, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. `` A person being raped is no worse than a person being killed,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner-Bender </PERSON> stayed away from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> for 25 years after the violent summer of 1964. But when she finally returned, she quickly showed why she and her slain husband were in the vanguard back when the South was the battleground of the civil rights movement. She broke a long silence about those bloody days in a scorching speech to a crowd commemorating the 25th anniversary of the deaths of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>. The crowd listened intently as she recalled leaving <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a broken-hearted young widow. But when she spoke Wednesday, it was as a gray-haired woman who has put the past behind her. Schwerner-Bender, who has remarried and lives in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, quickly made it clear she has not forgotten the sad lessons she learned about hatred and prejudice in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and about the Mississippians who were willing to fight against these evils. `` This is a bittersweet moment for me,'' she told the hushed crowd. `` It's sad because it recalls personal pain but good because I have the opportunity, after all these years, to say hello to many people whose kindness and courage was beyond explaining. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and I lived for six months in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>. During that time we were housed and fed and befriended by people who took great risk to take care of us and be our friends.'' She said she has thought a lot about the significance of the so-called `` Philadelphia-To-Philadelphia Project'' that brought people from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to commemorate the anniversary of the three deaths. `` This is n't about just three men,'' she said. `` These men were part of a continuum of history in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Where should we start? With <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, who sat in a bus seat in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, and started a boycott which grabbed the attention of a country which preferred not to know? With <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, whose efforts brought death to himself but whose work helped to ensure the changes which were destined to occur?'' By now, the crowd was urging her on as she ticked off a list of heroic figures in the civil rights movement. She continued, `` And all the brave men and women whose names are not part of the history books but who dared to risk their lives and honor for a most overwhelming and simple concept _ that all women and all men are born to be free, to live with dignity, respect and hope.'' She said she had had the difficult task of explaining to her children, when they were young, why anyone would intentionally hurt or kill another person. And she said she had had to try and explain racism. `` We as a nation,'' she said, `` have yet to purge ourselves of the cultural and institutional racism which was certainly a part of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> of 25 years ago, and continues to be a part of this country today.

 <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner-Bender </PERSON> stayed away from <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> for 25 years after the violent summer of 1964. But when she finally returned, she quickly showed why she and her slain husband were in the vanguard back when the South was the battleground of the civil rights movement. She broke a long silence about those bloody days in a scorching speech to a crowd commemorating the 25th anniversary of the deaths of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>. The crowd listened intently as she recalled leaving <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, a broken-hearted young widow. But when she spoke Wednesday, it was as a gray-haired woman who has put the past behind her. Schwerner-Bender, who has remarried and lives in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, quickly made it clear she has not forgotten the sad lessons she learned about hatred and prejudice in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and about the Mississippians who were willing to fight against these evils. `` This is a bittersweet moment for me,'' she told the hushed crowd. `` It's sad because it recalls personal pain but good because I have the opportunity, after all these years, to say hello to many people whose kindness and courage was beyond explaining. `` <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> and I lived for six months in <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>. During that time we were housed and fed and befriended by people who took great risk to take care of us and be our friends.'' She said she has thought a lot about the significance of the so-called `` Philadelphia-To-Philadelphia Project'' that brought people from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to commemorate the anniversary of the three deaths. `` This is n't about just three men,'' she said. `` These men were part of a continuum of history in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Where should we start? With <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Parks </PERSON>, who sat in a bus seat in <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, and started a boycott which grabbed the attention of a country which preferred not to know? With <PERSON> Medgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Evers </PERSON>, whose efforts brought death to himself but whose work helped to ensure the changes which were destined to occur?'' By now, the crowd was urging her on as she ticked off a list of heroic figures in the civil rights movement. She continued, `` And all the brave men and women whose names are not part of the history books but who dared to risk their lives and honor for a most overwhelming and simple concept _ that all women and all men are born to be free, to live with dignity, respect and hope.'' She said she had had the difficult task of explaining to her children, when they were young, why anyone would intentionally hurt or kill another person.

<HEAD>Mayors Conference Ends on Discordant Note</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new leader of the nation's mayors is confident the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will pay attention to urban needs. But her optimism was n't shared by all her colleagues at the end of their annual conference. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>, a Democrat who is mayor of the city President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> calls home, assumed the presidency of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> as the group ended its five-day annual meeting Wednesday. The mayors adjourned on a discordant note with an unprecedented floor fight over future leadership of the conference. The contest was decided along party lines with the selection of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, a Democrat and outspoken critic of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, as a future president of the conference. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> maintained an optimistic and conciliatory tone toward the administration following the meeting and praised Cabinet members and other administration officials who spoke to the mayors. `` After hearing from them, we are optimistic that our issues will be on their agenda,'' she said. But mayors called on the White House to provide support for increased federal aid to cities and for urban problems of drugs, crime, homelessness and poverty. The mayors asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for an immediate $ 822 million increase in the fight against drugs. `` Urban America has been neglected over the last eight years, and the need is even greater than before,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, outgoing president of the group. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>'s election capped a partisan fight for the job that puts him in line to be president of the organization _ and leading spokesman for the nation's mayors _ in 1991. <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> voted against <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> and in favor of a Republican <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Althaus </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, in a vote that was otherwise decided largely along party lines. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said that at issue in the dispute was whether mayors were willing to `` have an aggressive voice'' against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s urban policies. `` I do n't think this is the time for mayors to sit back and just go along, to say everything's all right in our cities,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Everything is not all right in our cities. ... The Federal government has walked away from our cities.'' The mayors devoted scant attention during their meetings to the unfolding scandals at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> _ the agency that handles most federal aid to cities. The scandals include evidence of massive embezzlement and the steering of millions of dollars in grants to projects based on political favoritism during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Frankly, our efforts with <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> will be primarily aimed at the future rather than the past,'' <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON> said. `` We do believe it is the duty of Mr. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> -LRB- Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> -RRB- to address the scandals. ... Our goal will not be to chastise someone now gone from the agency about what was done or not done last year.'' The conference approved unanimously a policy statement calling on the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to raise federal taxes to reduce the deficit and to finance greater spending on urban problems. The mayors also called for an outright ban on possession, as well as manufacture and sale, of `` military-type'' semiautomatic assault weapons. That goes far beyond <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ban on the importation of foreign-made assault weapons and would, if it became law, render illegal thousands of such weapons now owned by Americans. The mayors' resolutions become the new policies that will guide conference lobbying in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. They approved a resolution saying mayors `` deplore'' recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that are weakening affirmative action programs and `` making it more difficult to ensure equal opportunities in employment for all Americans.'' Other resolutions called for tougher action against drugs, poverty, homelessness and AIDS. But in an earlier committee, mayors deleted a proposal by <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> to encourage free distribution of needles to drug addicts as a way to reduce spread of AIDS.

<HEAD>Test May Speed AIDS Treatment of Newborns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With a new test, doctors may be able to begin treating AIDS-infected babies soon after birth rather than waiting more than a year to make sure they truly carry the virus, doctors reported today. Babies of infected women have about a one in three chance of picking up the AIDS virus from their mothers. But until about age 16 months, there is no foolproof way of sorting out which infants are infected and which are not. Therefore, doctors have been unable to try early treatment with the AIDS medicine AZT. The drug has been shown to help _ though not cure _ youngsters with more advanced disease. Doctors caution, however, that the test may miss some infected babies, and it is still too difficult to be used routinely. The technique, known as polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, can spot the genes of viruses that have invaded blood cells. `` It's something of a breakthrough. We have been very hindered by the fact that we do n't have diagnostic tests in infants,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We need that critically,'' she added, `` because people would like to start treatment with AZT very early on. But you are stuck with treating every child born to a -LRB- virus -RRB- positive mother with a fairly toxic drug, and you'll be treating some kids who do n't have the infection and do n't need it.'' Ordinarily, doctors check for AIDS infections by testing the blood for antibodies to the virus. Those who carry antibodies are presumed to be infected. This method is worthless for newborns. Babies whose mothers were infected will carry their mothers' AIDS antibodies for months, even if the babies themselves are not infected. `` This will be the key role of PCR,'' commented Dr. <PERSON> Cody </PERSON> <PERSON> Meissner </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` We will be able to do a test on the baby's blood in the first weeks of life, and hopefully this will differentiate between kids who are truly infected and those who are simply born to women who are infected.'' Doctors have been reluctant to treat all newborns of infected mothers with AZT until they can find out which ones are truly infected. Otherwise they would be giving the toxic drug to twice as many uninfected babies as infected ones. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and colleagues at six <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> hospitals tried out the test on newborns of women infected with the AIDS virus. They report their results in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the study, the test revealed AIDS infections in five of seven newborns who later went on to develop AIDS. It also showed infection in one of eight newborns who later had non-specific symptoms, such as swollen lymph glands, that could have been caused by the AIDS virus. The test results were negative in nine infants who remained well. While childhood AIDS infections are rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they are becoming a major health hazard in parts of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Another study in the journal describes the results of a study on 475 infants who were born to infected mothers at two hospitals in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. The research, directed by Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryder </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, concludes that AIDS may already have increased infant mortality there by 15 percent. The study found that women with more advanced AIDS infections are more likely to pass the virus to their babies during pregnancy. Infected women are also more apt to deliver babies who are premature or unusually small.

<TEXT>
 Panicked families are crowding the airport of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> desert town where four people have been killed in ethnic violence, Pravda reported today. Two people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds after the unrest in the <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> town, Novy Uzen, spread Wednesday to settlements 40 miles away, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. `` The Novy Uzen airport is packed with families'' trying to leave town, and threats by `` inciters'' of further violence are keeping the 56,000 residents near the <LOCATION> Caspian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> on edge, Pravda reported. Most of the violence in <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> has been aimed at settlers from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> region, who make up more than a third of the town's population. Native Kazakhs complain the Caucasus settlers dominate the oil industry jobs on which the town depends and receive preferential treatment in housing and other benefits. The settlers have also set up private businesses that are accused of selling supplies in the isolated town for exorbitant prices, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The Novy Uzen violence, which began last weekend, was the third outbreak of ethnic rioting fueled by economic hardship in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in the last six weeks. In the worst of the violence, about 100 people were killed in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> in attacks by ethnic Uzbeks against the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> Turkish minority, which was forcibly resettled there by <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1944. In Novy Uzen, more than 50 police and soldiers were reported to have been injured while restoring order after a fight at a dance hall erupted into four days of brawling and arson. Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were sent in, and a 9 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew was imposed. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said authorities have ordered increased security for the town's water, sewer and electricity systems, as well as food stores and a bread factory _ all targets of rioters who want to `` be able to dictate their own conditions to the authorities.'' Pravda said that although Novy Uzen was quiet Wednesday, disturbances spread to <LOCATION> Munaishi </LOCATION>, where two people were hurt, and to <LOCATION> Zhetibai </LOCATION>, where about 500 people demonstrated.

 Seven more `` rioters'' were executed today, bringing to 27 the number reported put to death in two days for their roles in protests against the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement. The official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the seven people executed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> today were convicted of setting army trucks on fire, stealing army goods or assaulting soldiers when the military invaded the capital on June 3-4. The executions were carried out despite international pleas for clemency. They came a day after three men were executed in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for setting fire to a train June 6 after it ran through a barricade, striking and killing six protesters. Also Wednesday, 17 people were executed in the northeastern provincial city of <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION>, a reporter for a local newspaper said by telephone. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> gave no details of today's executions other than to say a court had rejected appeals of the seven, who were convicted Saturday and included workers but not students. Most executions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are with a bullet to the back of the head. The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> executions were the first announced for crimes allegedly committed during nationwide protests after the army killed hundreds of unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> in June 4. None of the 27 people reported executed have been identified as students, who inspired the pro-democracy movement. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinhua </PERSON> said today it was `` futile'' for foreign countries to try to exert pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. She said suppression of the nationwide `` rebellion'' was an internal affair and other nations should not interfere. She also urged the more than 20 Chinese diplomats who have defected abroad to return home, saying they were led astray by misinformation. Foreign leaders have urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to be lenient with people arrested for roles in the pro-democracy movement and for taking part in protests once the crackdown began. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, referring to the execution of the three workers in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> on Wednesday, said, `` We deeply regret the fact that these executions have gone forward.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said she was `` utterly appalled'' by the executions while Australian Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> called the death sentences `` intolerable.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> said today that his country would lodge a formal diplomatic complaint to demonstrate its `` revulsion'' at the executions. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> quoted Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as saying, `` That this kind of thing should happen amid rising international criticism is extremely regrettable.'' Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> on Wednesday said countries that try to exert diplomatic and economic pressures on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the world's most populous country, are `` short-sighted and unwise.'' The Foreign Ministry's <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hopes to maintain good relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but, `` We firmly oppose the American government interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and exerting pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has curtailed military sales and contacts and suspended high-level meetings to protest the harsh suppression of dissent. The 17 people executed in <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION> on Wednesday had been sentenced the day before at a public rally, the reporter for the <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION> Daily said. The reporter, who declined to be identified, said the 17 were common criminals _ not participants in the student-led movement for democracy. However, a local radio broadcast said Wednesday that the 17 were among 45 people put on trial for taking part in disturbances in <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province. Most major <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities were wracked by demonstrations and riots after the military assault in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, which ran out of central Tiananmen Square students who had for seven weeks agitated for a freer <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. More than 1,600 people, including student and labor activists, have been arrested since the government crushed the pro-democracy movement and began a campaign against dissent. The propaganda barrage has included calls for people to inform on friends and relatives. Official media today announced the arrest of 13 `` spies'' allegedly working for the rival government in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to foment unrest during the student democracy movement. They identified one as <PERSON> Ou </PERSON> <PERSON> Zongyou </PERSON>, a Chinese man arrested in <LOCATION> Guiyang </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, said to have spread rumors, slandered the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, collected banned publications and taken pictures of anti-state demonstrations during the `` counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' The other 12 alleged spies included three from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, five from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, two from <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, one from <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION> and one from <PERSON> Ningxia </PERSON>. The reports said they had been recruited by <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> military intelligence or local agents to infiltrate the pro-democracy movement. Television tape showed several of them joining demonstrations and chanting along with the crowds in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> before the military recaptured it. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official press also reported 37 more people had turned themselves in in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, bringing to 102 the number of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> residents who had surrendered to police. They included some leaders of the independent student and citizens' groups that sprung up during the protests. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has told local courts those who turn themselves in and confess their wrongdoings should be given lenient treatment, while those who resist arrest should be punished severely. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> radio said <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Chifeng </PERSON>, a student who helped organize the ill-fated three-week student sit-in at <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> was arrested in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Changchun </LOCATION>.

 The Who _ the guitar - and drum-smashing rock band that once sneered, `` Hope I die before I get old'' _ launched its 25th anniversary tour, and nothing more than a tambourine got broken The graying rockers performed `` My Generation'' and 39 other songs at a small arena here for an audience of about 5,000 people, some of whom were not even born when the anthem of youthful bravado was recorded in 1966. The Who is just one of a spate of old rock bands hitting the road this year to coax Baby Boomers back into stadiums and concert halls. <PERSON> Ringo </PERSON> <PERSON> Starr </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Doobie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Allman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> will tour this summer, with the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> following this fall. The Who splintered after a `` farewell tour'' in 1982-83 but regrouped for its 25th anniversary. Dressed in a baggy gray suit with his hair in a ponytail, <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> leaped in the air and banged power chords on his guitar with his trademark windmill motion. But in a concession to age and hearing damage caused by years of loud music, <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> strummed an acoustic guitar for most of the show. Singer <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON> spun his microphone in the air and banged two tambourines together until one shattered and he had to toss it aside. The Who performed a series of their hits during the more than three-hour show, including `` Wo n't Get Fooled Again,'' `` Who Are You,'' `` <PERSON> Baba </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>,'' `` Substitute'' and `` Ca n't Explain.'' <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON> played three songs from his upcoming album, `` The Iron Man.'' Bassist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> also performed solo. The three surviving band members were supplemented by 11 musicians, including a five-piece horn section. The Who's original drummer, <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon </PERSON>, died in 1978. Except for two indoor performances of `` Tommy'' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the summertime tour is set for outdoor stadiums. The band made a last-minute exception in <LOCATION> Glens </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, an upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> city of 20,000 where The Who rented the civic center for nearly two weeks of rehearsal. The tour has been criticized by many in the music community, who note that <PERSON> Townshend </PERSON>, <PERSON> Entwistle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daltrey </PERSON> have n't enjoyed the same financial success with individual tours and records as they did with The Who. The cover of the current Musician magazine features a drawing of the band members as the centerpiece of a dollar bill. The tour moves to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, the city that hosted the last performance of The Who before their breakup.

<HEAD>Free Speech Advocates Back Court Ruling on Flag-Burning</HEAD>

 Free speech advocates are hailing a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burning case they say fortifies and expands constitutional protection for political dissent. But conservatives and veterans groups expressed anger and sadness. The justices, by a 5-4 vote Wednesday, said burning the American flag as a form of political protest is protected by the Constitution's free speech guarantees. The court said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> authorities violated a protester's rights when they prosecuted him under a state law barring desecration or destruction of the flag. The justices upheld a lower court ruling that overturned the protester's conviction, one-year prison term and $ 2,000 fine. The federal government and every state except <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> have similar laws against flag-burning. Professor <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Redish </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said the ruling means `` the government can not censor a viewpoint based on its offensiveness.'' He said he was delighted, and somewhat surprised, that Justices <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> _ both appointed to the high court by former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ voted with the majority. `` I've been called an extremist for free speech. I'm in good company now,'' <PERSON> Redish </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kropp </PERSON>, president of the liberal People for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Way </LOCATION>, said, `` As a nation, we are strong enough to withstand the pain of seeing our flag burned. What we could not withstand is seeing the First Amendment cast aside out of a misguided sense of nationalism.'' But H.F. `` Sparky'' <PERSON> Gierke </PERSON>, national commander of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` As a veteran my first reaction to the decision is one of anger. Then my anger turns to extreme sadness. This is a sad day for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanogle </PERSON>, national adjutant of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION>, said on `` CBS This Morning'' that all Americans should fly the flag and wear flag lapel tacks `` as a sign of positive protest'' of the decision. `` We're going to seek legislation, and if it comes to the fact of seeking a constitutional amendment to make desecration of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> flag a crime, we'll do that, too,'' he said. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Slobidin </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said, `` for anyone who loves the flag this is an outrage ... a kick in the teeth.'' Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., also criticized the ruling `` In my view, the Constitution, for which millions of men and women have given their lives to defend, holds no guarantee for desecration, no basic right to deface,'' he said. The closely watched case echoed public-patriotism themes from last year's presidential campaign and called to mind the political turmoil during the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, campaigning for the presidency in 1988, attacked Democratic opponent Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for vetoing legislation to require that public school teachers lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the legislation was unconstitutional, and he said he resented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s questioning of his patriotism Both men made heavy use of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags during campaign appearances. During the height of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the fighting in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> some two decades ago, draft card burning and flags bearing peace symbols were common forms of protest. While Wednesday's ruling broadly limits the power of the state and federal governments to restrict even offensive dissent, the decision does not condone flag-burning that could incite a riot. The court said there are laws against breaches of the peace that outlaw incitement to riot, and that those statutes are not affected by the ruling. The central figure in the case was <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION>. He was convicted of flag-burning during a 1984 rally at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> in which protesters chanted, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the red, white and blue. We spit on you.'' The demonstration ended with the marchers pouring lighter fluid on and igniting an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag that authorities said was taken from a pole outside a bank building. `` I think it's an important victory ... that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was forced to back off,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. `` I do n't consider myself an American,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> added. `` I'm not. I'm an internationalist, a proletarian internationalist.'' The Korean War veteran who scooped up the fragments of the flag said he is grieved that the conviction has been overturned. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, 61, a West Point graduate, said the burning was uncalled for and `` I still do not know what they were protesting.'' He buried what was left of the flag according to <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> regulations and received a letter of thanks from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In another important test of the rights of free expression, the court limited states' power to punish the news media for reporting truthful, legally obtained information. By a 6-3 vote, the court threw out a $ 97,500 award against a newspaper, won by a rape victim whose name the paper had published. In other decisions Wednesday, the court: _ Unanimously ruled that a federal law allowing public scrutiny of governmental advisory groups does not apply to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s role in picking federal judges _ Voted, 5-4, to give railroads more leeway to sell off rail lines without first entering into collective bargaining about the effect of the sale _ Made it easier, in a case involving a dispute between the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientology </ORGANIZATION>, for the government to conduct tax-fraud investigations

<TEXT>
 Composer <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Sauguet </PERSON>, best known for his postwar ballet musical score `` Musique des Forains,'' died at his home in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> today after a long illness, his family said. He was 88. <PERSON> Sauguet </PERSON> had been partly paralyzed for two years and had been suffering from heart problems, his son, <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> <PERSON> Luzel </PERSON>, said. <PERSON> Sauguet </PERSON> _ who was born <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Poupard </PERSON> on May 18, 1901, in <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> _ studied the piano and the organ as a child. After World War I, he moved to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and met up with other musicians of the era, such as <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Koechlin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Darius </PERSON> <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Erik </PERSON> <PERSON> Satie </PERSON>. His first real success in the French capital came in 1924 with the production at the Champs Elysees Theater of `` Le Plumet du Colonel.'' He went on to compose such ballets as `` La Chatte,'' directed by <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Diagliev </PERSON> for the Ballets Russes and choreographed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION> in 1927, <PERSON> Ida </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>'s `` <PERSON> David </PERSON>,'' and <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Giradoux </PERSON>'s `` Ondine.'' Besides his musical scores for at least 14 ballets, eight theatrical productions, symphonies, quartets, collections of songs and scores for some 35 films, Sauguet tried operatic scores. The lengthy `` La Chartreuse de Parme'' was produced in 1939 at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Opera. It received mixed reviews, and <LOCATION> Sauget </LOCATION> went back to his first love _ ballet. `` Les Forains,'' which translates loosely as `` Wanderers' music,'' was written for <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 Amid the euphoria at the end of World War II, it touched a popular chord and <PERSON> Sauguet </PERSON>'s fame spread abroad. In the postwar years he composed mainly comic opera and later wrote popular musical scores for children. In 1976 he was elected a member of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, to the chair previously occupied by <PERSON> Milhaud </PERSON> at the Academie des Beaux-Arts. Sauguet is to be buried Tuesday at the <LOCATION> Montmartre </LOCATION> cemetery in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>.

 An East German man who swam across a river to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> only to be dragged back by border guards has been freed by East German authorities, Allied officials said today. The man was turned over to Western authorities one day after the three <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allies </ORGANIZATION> _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ threatened to cut off travel by politicians and diplomats to communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> unless the 21-year-old <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Notev </PERSON> was freed. The Allies said the Notev had swum the <LOCATION> Spree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> territory when he was seized by border guards on Feb. 14 and dragged back to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by his hair. The guards returned Notev to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and he was later sentenced to four years in prison. In a statement today, British military authorities said <PERSON> Notev </PERSON> was released and reported to a refugee camp in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The Allies had called the East German guards' action a kidnapping. They said <PERSON> Notev </PERSON> had already reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> territory after swimming the <LOCATION> Spree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which separates communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Notev and two friends used a truck to crash through border barriers on the communist side of the river, jumped into the river and swam to the Western side. The two friends made it safely up the bank but guards from a patrol boat seized <PERSON> Notev </PERSON> as he was trying to get over the bank. The guards pulled at Notev's hair and took him away, according to the Allies. The Allies also said one East German guard violated Western territory by stepping on the bank. Dramatic photographs in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> newspapers showed Notev trying to pull himself over the top of the steep bank as the guards from the boat were dragging him away. The incident occurred near the old <LOCATION> Reichstag </LOCATION> building, in the British sector of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The Spree is in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> territory. Tuesday's Allied protest, which West German newspapers described as unusually strong, followed several unsuccessful attempts to win <PERSON> Notev </PERSON>'s release. The Allies said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had failed to even acknowledge the incident, while Soviet authorities said they were not responsible. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> had also appealed on <PERSON> Notev </PERSON>'s behalf and his case had been raised by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in talks with Soviet officials, Allied sources said.

 A man was convicted of murdering his wife and 11-year-old stepdaughter, who taped the slayings on a cassette recorder later found tucked between the pillows on her bed. Prosecutor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hannis </PERSON> said he will seek the death penalty against <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON> at sentencing July 20. A jury deliberated 2 -LCB- hours Wednesday before convicting <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON>, 48, of first-degree murder in the 1988 stabbings of his wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON>, and stepdaughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. The 90-minute tape, played for the jury Monday, culminated in Mrs. <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON>' screams. `` I'm dying. ... Please help me,'' she was heard saying. `` You're bleeding just like a stuck hog. I love you so mcuh,'' her husband replied. Defense attorney <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinle </PERSON> contended <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON> stabbed both in a rage. If jurors had believed there was no premeditation, they could have convicted him of second-degree murder or manslaughter, which carry lesser sentences. The couple had quarreled throughout the day about their deteriorating one-year marriage. The fight spun out of control when Mrs. <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON> refused to go to bed with her husband. In his closing argument, <PERSON> Hannis </PERSON> held up the girl's picture and said: `` I had some help from <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>. She put the tape in the tape recorder and turned it on.'' `` I sat and listened to the tape,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a sister of Mrs. <PERSON> Lavers </PERSON>. `` And I was warned ahead of time that it was going to be gruesome. And I cried when it was played. We all cried.''

 The Israeli army today raided the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Silwad </LOCATION>, fatally shooting a 22-year-old Palestinian who refused to obey orders to stop and detaining 30 people, the military said. Soldiers also sealed three Palestinian homes in and near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> after their residents were detained on suspicion of attacking <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers with firebombs, the army said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, the body of an Israeli history professor was found today, and police said they were investigating whether criminal or terrorist motives were behind the stabbing. The body of <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> was discovered by schoolchildren in a park across from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building, <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said robbery was ruled out because a watch and money were found on <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s body. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, 64, was believed to be walking from his home to nearby <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> when the attack occurred, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. He was an expert on Jewish history during the Second Temple period. The temple was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70. The army raid on <LOCATION> Silwad </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, was the latest in a series aimed at capturing <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. The Palestinian fatality was identified as <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Raouf </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON>. The army spokesman's office said the victim was shot `` after he refused to obey an order to stop.'' His death raised to 528 the number of Palestinians killed since the start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> 18 months ago. Twenty-three Israelis also have died in the violence. The army said the 30 people detained were suspected of throwing stones or firebombs at cars of passing Jewish settlers. Arabs from villages near <LOCATION> Silwad </LOCATION> said today they had received an unsigned warning from Jewish settlers in the area threatening retaliatory action against stone-throwers. `` We are seeking peace with you, but we are giving you a last warning,'' said the fliers printed in Arabic and tossed on village streets. `` If bloodshed continues, we are going to be forced to take harsh measures against all who are behind the disturbances.'' Jewish settlers in the territories have been blamed for a series of assaults on Palestinians in recent weeks. About 70,000 Jewish settlers live in guarded communities in the occupied lands, home to 1.7 million Palestinians. On May 29, a 13-year-old Palestinian girl was shot to death when settlers raided the village of <LOCATION> Kifel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harith </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, a settler opened fire with an Uzi machine gun on Palestinians near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, wounding two of them. The assailant was captured by police. The shooting near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> occurred shortly after hundreds of angry Israeli settlers shouted down Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> at a funeral of a settler slain in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Three Palestnians have been arrested in the killing.

<HEAD>Official Media Carry Faculty Statement on Katyn Blame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government-run media today published a university resolution blaming the Soviet secret police for the massacre of Polish soldiers at <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> in World War II. It was the most direct statement of blame reported by the official press. The <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> faculty condemned what it called efforts to obscure `` the basic fact known in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the world for nearly half a century. Namely: the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> crime committed on thousands of Polish officers interned by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1939 was committed by <ORGANIZATION> NKVD </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police -RRB- bodies.'' The resolution was carried by the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency and was published in the daily pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Slowo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poszechne </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. In recent months, the Polish government has moved toward rejecting the official version of the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> massacre, which says the 4,200 officers were shot by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in 1941 after <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Although discussion of <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> was taboo in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for four decades, most Poles and historians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> believe the slayings were carried out by the Soviet secret police on <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s order in 1940 while the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were allied. The officers, the cream of Polish society called up from the reserves and interned by the Soviets shortly after the outbreak of the war, were shot in the back of the head and dumped in mass graves in <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, near the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Smolensk </LOCATION>. The fate of another 10,000 officers, interned at two other Soviet camps, has never been revealed. They are also presumed to have been executed. The Polish side of a joint commission investigating `` blank spots'' in Polish-Soviet history has reported the tentative conclusion of Soviet responsibility for <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, and a government spokesman has said there is circumstantial evidence. But there has been no direct statement assigning blame and no response from the Soviet side of the joint commission. The resolution said, `` The maneuvers around the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> crime consist in attempts to create a false appearance that despite obviousness, the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> case is very unclear and calls for long-term research. `` Unfortunately, the Polish-Soviet commission of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> historians is also being used as a tool in these maneuvers.'' The unanimous faculty statement critcized efforts to `` create a cover and an excuse for all those who for nearly half a century have tried to falsify the truth about <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION>, thus becoming the supporters of the terrible crime.'' The official media in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> have written about <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> this year, and in April, soil from the <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> graves was sent to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> by an official delegation. The official tablet on a <LOCATION> Katyn </LOCATION> monument in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> that blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> has been removed.

 A drug used to treat epilepsy during pregnancy to prevent birth defects may itself harm the unborn baby, scientists reported today. In the report, doctors linked the drug Tegretol, or carbamazepine, with minor facial abnormalities and retardation. Several other drugs to treat epilepsy, which afflicts an estimated 4.9 million Americans, also have been shown to be bad for the fetus. `` Physicians who treat women with seizures are in a very difficult position,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacro </PERSON>, whose study appears in the New England Journal of Medicine. `` This is the drug of choice, because it seemed to be safe. We ca n't say that anymore.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION>, which makes Tegretol, said the study is a reminder that the risks and benefits of anticonvulsant drugs need to be weighed carefully, but the medicine should still be considered for epileptics who want to have children. `` We feel that our past data show that Tegretol is a good option for epileptic women. We still feel that way,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kernen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lacro </PERSON>, a pediatrician at <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was a co-author of the study directed by Dr. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyons </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION>. The report found evidence that women who took Tegretol during pregnancy were more likely to produce babies with delayed development and mental retardation. They also were more likely to have unusual facial formations _ including upward slanting eyes, long upper lips and short noses _ and incomplete development of finger nails. Studies have shown that severe epileptic seizures during pregnancy can temporarily interrupt the flow of blood to the fetus, causing brain damage. However, epileptic women have an increased risk of producing babies with minor birth defects, even if they do n't have seizures during their pregnancies. `` Counseling has to start before pregnancy for these women,'' said <PERSON> Lacro </PERSON>. `` If the woman has severe enough seizures and needs the medicine, then by all means you have to give it. But there is no completely safe therapy other than being off medications.'' The researchers first identified the pattern of birth defects in eight children who had been exposed to the drug before birth. They confirmed it by evaluating 48 other children whose mothers had taken the medicine. They found that 11 percent of those exposed had facial abnormalities, 26 percent had incomplete finger nails and 20 percent were slow to develop. Only one youngster with delayed development was old enough to take an intelligence test. That child, a 6 year old, had an IQ of 65. <ORGANIZATION> Ciba-Geigy </ORGANIZATION> criticized the study for `` serious methodological problems.'' It noted that the doctors used women who did not have epilepsy in a comparison group. The higher risk of birth defects among the children of the epileptic women might have resulted from the epilepsy, not the medications. <PERSON> Lacro </PERSON> said: `` I think that what we are seeing is due to the drug. If the changes that we saw were due to seizures alone, then we would see the same pattern of malformations for all kinds of seizure drugs. I think the defects are drug specific, but I ca n't prove that.''

 <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has rejected several recent attempts by third countries to mediate with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister was quoted as saying today. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>'s interview in the Dubai-based Arabic newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Bayan </ORGANIZATION> was published as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s parliament speaker visited the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the highest ranking Iranian official to do so in a decade <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was interested in good foreign relations as long as that does n't compromise its independence, <ORGANIZATION> Al-Bayan </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Several countries have approached us for some kind of mediation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But we reject that as the <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has never welcomed such mediations,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the interview in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The newspaper did not say when the interview occurred. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> refused to give names of the countries which approached <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> for mediation nor to elaborate on relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the paper. He said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wanted good relations with other nations, but only if that does n't require sacrifices of Islamic principles and independence. He did not say in what way having relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> would be compromising for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who died of a heart attack June 3, repeatedly referred to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the `` Great Satan.'' Relations were severed in 1979 after students declaring allegiance to <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s Islamic revolution seized the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants to improve relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states on basis of mutual respect among neighbors. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s professed goal of spreading its Islamic revolution strained its relations with several Arab nations. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is our neighbor, and we want to expand bilateral ties with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on basis of friendship and good neighborly relations and not on the base of scaring others,'' he said. Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> has been in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since Tuesday to sign a number of economic and commercial agreements. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said his country hoped to have good relations with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states. `` At present we have strong relations with a number of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states, but we have problems with others, and normalizing relations with these depends on the ability of those countries to solve these major problems,'' he said. <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said the problem nations include <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has condemned <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> for signing a peace treaty with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> broke ties in 1988, and strains persist with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> especially over the restrictions the kingdom imposed on the number of pilgrims to the annual Hajj to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Judge Holds Casino Responsible in Challenge to Free-Drink Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Casinos can be held liable for money lost by drunk gamblers, a federal judge ruled. `` A casino has a duty to refrain from knowingly permitting an invitee to gamble where that patron is obviously and visibly intoxicated and-or under the influence of a narcotic substance,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said Wednesday. The judge said casinos should fall under <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION>'s dram shop laws, which hold taverns responsible for injuries caused by their intoxicated patrons. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON>, a gaming analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, said the ruling is a blow to the casinos. `` If it holds up, what that means is anybody who was a big loser can say, ` Look, I had too many drinks. I do n't owe anything,''' he said. The Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino had sued <PERSON> Schmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aboud </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for $ 30,000 in losses incurred in 1985 during a two-week gambling visit. <PERSON> Aboud </PERSON> countersued, claiming he lost $ 200,000 because casino employees plied him with free alcohol. The Golden Nugget had asked the judge to throw the case out, arguing that no law holds casinos responsible for debts incurred by intoxicated patrons. The ruling Wednesday allows the court case to continue toward a finding of whether the Golden Nugget was responsible for <PERSON> Aboud </PERSON>'s losses `` We were saying to the judge that unless these cases are cut off at the pass, there will be a flood of these,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Dratch </PERSON>, attorney for the Golden Nugget. `` Essentially, the judge is saying, ` That's the price you pay for being in this business.''' <PERSON> Aboud </PERSON>, whose gambling money came from a $ 395,000 settlement of an auto accident case, also is suing two doctors the casino supplied when he complained of back pain. He says the doctors gave him painkillers and that he lapsed into unconciousness after washing them down with cognac offered by casino employees. At that point, he claims, casino officials told him he would have to wake up and continue gambling or leave his complimentary $ 1,000-a-night suite. <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 11 casinos have various promotions that provide free drinks, meals, show tickets, rooms, transportation and coins to gamblers, particularly to high rollers. Cocktail waitresses walk among gamblers at slot machines and gaming tables taking drink orders. The ruling could halt the serving of free drinks and could force gaming hall operators to forbid drunk patrons from gambling, <PERSON> Roffman </PERSON> said. `` I really do n't think the casinos would win as much money if they did n't offer drinks on the gambling floor,'' he said. <PERSON> Aboud </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, did not return calls Wednesday.

 Underwater explorer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, whose deep-sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the bottom of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> two weeks ago, said today he believed the World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew. At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war. `` Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. `` It appears the crew opened it up along its entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.'' The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the robot called Argo, the same device that was used four years ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg. The Bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> when it sank during a battle with the British on May 27, 1941. Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived. The sinking occurred only eight days after the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Gydnia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, for her first operation, intended to attack convoys of merchant shipping and damage British morale at a time when <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power. The British sent the warship Hood after the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON>, but five days after the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> went to sea it sank the Hood with the loss of all but three of the British vessel's crew of 1,419. The Hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of World War II and symbolized British sea power, so its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> was found `` in a remarkable state of preservation. There does n't appear to be as much damage as I had expected.'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> is a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The Bismarck was found in more than 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

On other issues, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>: _ said the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order stands for the killing of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, British author of the novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s judgment was based on Islamic law and `` this is not the kind of prescription that can be reversed There is no one in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> who could reverse it.'' _ accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of unspecified `` plots and conspiracies'' against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> when asked about the possibility that relations would improve after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death _ said Afghans must be free to resolve their differences without outside interference after the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from their country more than four months ago <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> originally was expected to leave today but extended his visit. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that he left for <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> after the news conference. <ORGANIZATION> Teheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also planned to visit the southern republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, whose population is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has a consulate in the republic's capital, which the Iranian broadcast called `` the Moslem city of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> agreed on a broad spectrum of economic cooperation and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are expected to increase joint efforts in areas including atomic energy, space and gas processing. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> suggested a joint Soviet-Iranian space voyage during the visit, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ordered his deputies to begin working out the details. Rail links between the two countries will be restored and another rail line constructed, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> thanked <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> for the invitation and said frequent high-level contacts would be appropriate. No date was set for a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit. Topics discussed by the two included arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> sidestepped questions about any deals with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He said only that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was trying to be self-sufficient in arms but has some `` technical requirements that we would like to see met by various sources.'' Only a handful of Third World leaders have visited <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since the Islamic Revolution in 1979 sent mobs into the streets shouting, `` Death to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, Death to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>!'' The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was the chief arms supplier to <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> during its long war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that ended in a cease-fire last August. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> emphasized in remarks distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that several months before his death on June 3, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for better relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> exchanged messages in February, and since then their foreign ministers have met four times. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has about 50 million Moslems, most of them living in rapidly growing Central <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, which borders <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been troubled in the past year and a half by outbreaks of unrest among its more than 100 ethnic groups, and the disturbances have spread in the last six weeks to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. About 100 people were killed in rioting in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> earlier this month.

 An African summit to resolve <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war will fail without talks between the rebels and the government, guerrilla leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said before today's meeting. Speaking at his bush camp Wednesday, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> also said that `` never in 14 years of war have we come so close'' to peace. Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> left the capital, <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, early today for <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, where leaders of 22 African nations were gathering for the conference. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published today, Zairean President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> said <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> would meet <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> during the summit. But <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, head of the rebel <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, made no mention of talks with <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> during his news conference Wednesday in <LOCATION> Boa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Esperanca </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. Before leaving for <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> commuted the death sentences of 50 <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels condemned for high treason and terrorism between 1981 and 1987, the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday that the government released 700 rebel prisoners June 2. The prisoners reportedly renounced the rebel movement and accepted the government's offer of clemency, the dispatch said. The goal of the summit was to clear the way for peace talks between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government and the rebels. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said his delegation in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> was flexible about procedures leading to elections and formation of a national government. But the rebels do not want any amnesty or clemency that would imply they are criminals, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` Our army, 75,000 men in the field, will not accept amnesty, clemency or integration,'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said. `` That wording has a political context that means -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- is considered criminal. Our army was not defeated and is not going to be defeated.'' <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> said he had agreed to stay out of the negotiations and would not demand a role in any transitional government. He said, however, that he would continue to head his party and also wants to participate in free elections within two years of a formal cease-fire. The government has rejected elections, saying it wants to maintain one-party rule, with some rebels participating in the administration. Under a peace plan put forward by <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> would go abroad and recognize the legitimacy of the government, and the rebel movement would then be integrated into the one-party state. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> vetoed all these proposals. In six months, half the 50,000 Cuban soldiers who have supported the Angolan government will have left <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> under a U.S.-mediated peace agreement reached in December. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war to force the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> - and Soviet-assisted government to share power since shortly after <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975 In addition to <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, leaders from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guinea-Bissau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tome </LOCATION> e Principe, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Togo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Congo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Burundi </LOCATION>, were expected at the summit.

 <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s conservative party leader today demanded that interim Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> resign immediately following reports of a new financial scandal linked to his socialist administration. Banner front-page headlines today in the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> press said the scandal involved the laundering of $ 700 million through the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the state-run <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>, leader of the New Democracy party, and opposition dailies blamed <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> because the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is a state institution and its ranking executives are government appointees. `` We have this new terrible scandal, and this usurper of authority who shames and robs the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people must leave immediately,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said at a news conference. The governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Giorgos </PERSON> <PERSON> Anomeritis </PERSON>, denied that branches of the bank in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had committed any wrongdoing. `` Our branches are not allowed by law to accept deposits and consequently they use other American commercial banks. Therefore, they can not be responsible either for illegal desposits or the illegal transfer of funds,'' <PERSON> Anomeritis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, lost its bid for a third four-year term in Sunday's election, winning only 125 of the 300 seats in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s unicarmeral parliament. Previous financial scandals were blamed for the party's loss. New Democracy won 145 seats, six short of a clear majority that would enable it to form a government. The communist-leftist alliance emerged as a power broker with 28 seats, and <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> is negotiating with the alliance to form a coalition government. The money-laundering allegations were reported a day after judicial investigators asked parliament to lift the immunity of two former <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> ministers so they can be prosecuted on bribery charges. Former Public Order Minister <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Petsos </PERSON> is accused of receiving gifts and other unspecified criminal acts.

 A private panel formed to monitor the upcoming Nicaraguan elections says it plans to conduct polls in that country and seek a meeting with President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. However, <PERSON> Curtin </PERSON> <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bipartisan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> and Fair Elections in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, expressed concern Wednesday about <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>'s recent announcement that it will require <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors to have visas beginning July 1. Visas have not been required of Americans before. `` This has an element to it which suggests restriction, restriction for press and foreign observer presence, and we hope that will not be the case. It is a matter of some concern, however,'' <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, told reporters. In a letter to <PERSON> Leonor </PERSON> <PERSON> Huper </PERSON>, charge d'affaires of the Nicaraguan embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON> and co-chairman <PERSON> Gaylord </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator from <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, said the commission plans to send its six commissioners and several staff members to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> sometime this summer. The letter also asked for visa applications. <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, press officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, said she assumes the visas will be granted, but `` the official position is that the only people who will be allowed to be observers are those that have been invited to be observers by the government.'' `` There is really no restriction on the visas, unless someone is really undesirable,'' Ms. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said. `` There is no new qualification that people must go through simply because they are Americans.'' <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON> spoke at a news conference at which the commission released a report saying international observers, press and broadcast media must be free to travel throughout <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during the campaign to monitor the election process. The Nicaraguan elections are scheduled for February 1990. Ms. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said the embassy had not yet received a copy of the report. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> did not attend the news conference but said in a statement a number of delegation trips are planned to examine <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s political climate The first delegation plans to go to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in late July or early August and will request a meeting with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` Another integral part of the commission's activities will include a series of polls,'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said. `` The first poll will examine the political and economic climate in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and how the Nicaraguan people feel about the possibility of free elections.'' After that, he said, polls comparing support for opposition and government candidates are planned. The commission released letters seeking meetings with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Winsor </PERSON> told reporters it was uncertain whether the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, whose members were chosen by <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, `` will operate fairly.'' Commission member <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON>, a Democrat and international political consultant, said, `` Even though there are some questions about the composition of the council which may or may not be valid, it is by the actions of the electoral council that they should be judged.'' `` If we find that the decisions of the electoral council are being arrived at by consensus, I think that would be a very positive point,'' <PERSON> Bendixen </PERSON> said. `` If on the other hand most of the votes of the electoral council are 4-1 or 3-2, always in favor of the Sandinista position, then I think the entire electoral process in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> should be questioned.'' The commission, which held three days of hearings in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> May 9-11, is sponsored by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A sliver of light known as the `` sun dagger'' missed its mark on an ancient Indian rock etching on the opening day of summer for perhaps the first time in 1,000 years, scientists say. A shift in the position of a 9-foot-tall slab of sandstone atop nearby Fajada Butte, probably because of erosion, changed the angle at which the light fell Wednesday. `` It's very serious and sad,'' said archaeo-astronomer <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, who is credited with discovering the `` sun dagger'' 12 years ago. `` We knew when we first saw the site that it had a fragility that was remarkable.'' Researchers believe that the rock drawing, or petroglyph, was carved between 950 and 1150, at the peak of the Anasazi Indian culture. It is believed the carving was a kind of calendar, with the rocks arranged to cast distinctive patterns of light and shadow across it on important days of the year. The `` sun dagger'' occurred on the summer solstice, the first day of summer when the sun is at its highest point of the year in the Northern hemisphere. Distinctive patterns of light are also cast at the winter solstice and the fall and spring equinoxes _ when day and night are of equal length. `` We're used to this thing acting like a clock,'' physicist <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said. When the solstice arrived Wednesday, the dagger widened, lengthened and missed the circular dawing entirely, appearing above and to the left. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelik </PERSON>, a physics and astronomy professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, said it's clear the rocks have not moved much, if at all, over the years. He said the erosion noticed this year may be due to 10 years of wet weather. Many researchers believe <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s ancient rock monument known as Stonehenge is also arranged to take advantage of the summer solstice.

 Security forces killed one person and wounded another when they shot into an opposition political rally. The government today accused the main opposition party of inciting unrest and ordered it to stop. It was the sternest statement to date issued to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> and came one day after the shooting at the rally organized by the league. `` The government has been tolerant for a long time. The party concerned will have to bear the consequences of irresponsible and illegal acts,'' a spokesman for the military government told a news conference. `` It must be remembered that martial law is in force.'' The spokesman, <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, accused the party and its leader, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, of inciting the public to defy laws, of urging students to form `` suicide squads,'' and of organizing demonstrations to commemorate last year's pro-democracy uprising. Wednesday's incident appeared to be one of the most serious outbreaks of anti-government agitation since September, when troops crushed demonstrators in a hail of gunfire. The official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday night that about 500 people gathered at <LOCATION> Myenigon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> north of downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> to give `` agitating speeches,'' chant slogans and lay bouquets at the site. Witnesses said demonstrators were honoring pro-democracy demonstrators killed by government forces at the spot on June 21, 1988. The radio said security personnel fired five warning shots to disperse the crowd and took into custody <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>. She was released after being `` warned not to create disturbances,'' the radio said. While the opposition leader was in custody, 100 of the demonstrators `` shouted and charged at security personnel with what appeared to be an intent to attack the security personnel,'' the radio said. One person was killed and one wounded when one of the security men fired three shots `` to stop the charge,'' the broadcast added. The radio also said one `` disturbance maker'' was arrested with 24 pamphlets inciting trouble as 30 youths tried to enter the campus of <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, the daughter of a late national hero, Gen. <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON>, has emerged as the leading opposition figure to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s military government, headed by Gen Saw Maung. The government has promised elections next year and allowed the formation of political parties but still rules by martial law decree. Some campaigning by the opposition groups has been allowed but on occasion <LOCATION> Aung </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Suu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kyi </LOCATION> and others have been harassed. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> has been under authoritarian, military-backed rule since 1962, when Gen. <PERSON> Ne </PERSON> <PERSON> Win </PERSON> overthrew a democratic government. Last year, the country exploded into violence as hundreds of thousands took to the streets to demand democracy. Several thousand civilian protesters were killed over a period of several months before <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> stepped in to take power.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have virtually given up hope that Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mediators will be able to succeed in arranging a democratic transfer of power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> remained publicly optimistic today. One official dismissed the mediation as a `` corpse'' and said alternative ideas must be pursued for pressuring Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down. Three OAS mediators, aided by Secretary General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, have made two visits to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> over the past month to attempt to seek a solution to the country's political crisis. On their last visit, the mediators left some ideas with the two most powerful political blocs in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> on how to promote a dialogue. <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> is `` neither optimistic nor pessimistic'' about the prospects for success but believes the progress achieved to date has been satisfactory, according to an aide. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official criticized the effort, saying `` the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> has fallen on its face on this.'' The official, asking not to be identified, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats from around the hemisphere have been trying to enlist governments from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> to support the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position. Testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> this morning, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said today he remains `` very hopeful'' that the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediators will be successful. He reaffirmed the longstanding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> view that there can be no normalization of relations with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> so long as <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains in power. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been attempting to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of office since he was indicted by two <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> grand juries on drug smuggling charges in February 1988. But few, if any, governments in the hemisphere are as unswervingly opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Many are reluctant to intervene in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s internal affairs, while others see the issue as a U.S.-Panamanian problem that should be dealt with as such, the officials said. The official <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> position is that the mediation effort should not be judged until July 19, the deadline for the mediators to submit a report on their activities to <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers. The administration believes the only acceptable solution is for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to agree to step down as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> commander before the deadline. Privately, officials say there is no sign that will occur. The crisis arose last month when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s electoral tribunal, dominated by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s allies, tossed out the returns from the May 7 presidential elections. Independent observers said the opposition slate had won by a landslide. There was indignation throughout the hemisphere when, three days after the election, opposition candidates were beaten by government security agents. A week later, the <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> mediating team was set up. <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> foreign ministers blamed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for the `` grave events and abuses'' in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But much of the anti-Noriega sentiment has dissipated over the past six weeks, generating pessimism here that the mediators will be able to fulfill their mandate. The officials said the administration is weighing a series of options for bringing additional pressure to bear on <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, including the seizure of his overseas assets, believed to number in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

 Former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing has called for unifying <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s conservative parties and said this is the only way to wrest power from the Socialists. Giscard d'Estaing made the comments in an interview published today in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION> and in comments on television Wednesday night. He is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, a federation of five small center-right parties. The other main opposition party is the neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic. Giscard d'Estaing's comments came after his party and the Rally for the Republic joined forces in European <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elections during the weekend. The list of candidates put forward by the parties finished first with 28.9 percent of the vote, leading <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabius </PERSON>' Socialist list which had 23.6 percent. <PERSON> Simone </PERSON> <PERSON> Veil </PERSON>'s separate centrist list won 8.4 percent of the vote `` It was division that caused the opposition to lose'' last year's presidential and legislative elections, Giscard d'Estaing said. `` It is union that will cause it to win.'' <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, the president of the Rally for the Republic who lost his bid last year to unseat Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, reacted coolly to Giscard d'Estaing's idea. He told today's opening session of the party's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> there would be no `` fusion'' of the two parties. `` We have no intention of fusing with anybody, but reinforcing the links of solidarity'' between the opposition groups, he said. Giscard d'Estaing said a convention of the opposition parties should be held soon and a new, unified party created before the end of the year. Such a party, he said, would still be a place where ideas could be debated. The Socialists have the advantage of a single party, and while that party has its different wings, once decisions are made, or candidates designated, its leadership usually pulls together. It is the lack that cohesiveness that troubles the opposition. In last year's presidential elections, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> had to battle not only <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> calmly ran his own campaign, with only the small Communist thorn in his side.

 An army officer was killed today in a highway shootout between a man who kidnapped him and law enforcement officers, police said. It was not immediately clear who shot Col. <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieft </PERSON>, who was kidnapped at gunpoint as he left for work at about 6:45 a.m. Police spokesman <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Albers </PERSON> said the kidnapper was identified as <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroger </PERSON>, a 33-year-old from <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hartmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Mollring </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Kroger </ORGANIZATION> was serving a five-year jail term in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for several armed robberies and had been at large since May 10 when he failed to show up after a one-day prison furlough. <PERSON> Albers </PERSON> said the kidnapper forced <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieft </PERSON>, 56, into his car at gunpoint near the victim's home in <LOCATION> Apeldoorn </LOCATION>, 10 miles north of the eastern city of <LOCATION> Arnhem </LOCATION>. Police, alerted by a neighbor, chased the car and caught up with it at a gas station on the Arnhem-Utrecht freeway, said <PERSON> Albers </PERSON>. Police fired at the kidnapper, who was in the car with his victim, and a shootout ensued in which <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieft </PERSON> was killed, <PERSON> Albers </PERSON> said. The motive of the kidnapping was unclear, although at one point the kidnapper demanded $ 450,000 ransom, according to <PERSON> Albers </PERSON>. He said the victim and the kidnapper were apparently not acquainted. <PERSON> Kroger </PERSON> told police he was wanted by West German and Swiss police in connection with several armed robberies, according to <PERSON> Albers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Albers </PERSON> said it was unclear whether <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kieft </PERSON> was hit by the kidnapper or by police.

<HEAD>Libel Judgment Upheld Against Ohio Newspaper, but Strict Guidelines
Retained</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today unanimously upheld a $ 200,000 libel award against <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, but its ruling did not appear to weaken significantly the news media's protection against libel lawsuits by public officials and public figures The justices said a federal appeals court correctly ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> because of a 1983 article in the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Journal-News </PERSON>. But the decision also said the appeals court issued a misleading opinion about the standards of reporting and investigation by the media. The lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION>, which formerly published the <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, was filed by <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> lawyer who unsuccessfully ran for the office of municipal judge in a 1983 election against incumbent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>. A Nov. 1, 1983, article in the <PERSON> Journal-News </PERSON> said one of the women who offered testimony before a grand jury investigating alleged corruption in the municipal court system `` claims <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> offered her and her sister jobs and a trip to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> ` in appreciation' for their help'' in the investigation which he instigated. The article quoted the woman as saying she thought <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> used `` dirty tricks'' in obtaining her cooperation with his investigiation of <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> New </PERSON>, the court's chief administrative officer. The woman who was quoted in the article, and was its only source, was one of seven people who had attended a meeting with <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> when the offer allegedly was made. The others who attended denied that any offer of jobs or a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> trip was made. <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> sued <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> three months after he lost the election. A federal jury awarded him $ 5,000 in compensatory damages and $ 195,000 in punitive damages. Writing for the court, Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, `` The evidence in this case, when reviewed in its entirety, is unmistakably sufficient to support a finding of actual malice.'' Despite that, the decision today adhered to a 1984 ruling in which the nation's highest court said appellate courts must second-guess juries that rule for public officials and public figures in libel suits against news media defendants. In that 1984 decision, <PERSON> Bose </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the justices said appeals courts have broad authority _ and a constitutionally required obligation _ to review jury verdicts that favor public officials and public figures who sue for libel. To win such a suit, a public official or public figure must prove the allegedly libelous statement was false and was made with `` actual malice'' _ knowledge or reckless disregard of falsity. According to the record in today's case, <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> filed a private criminal complaint about five weeks before the election with <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> police based on corruption allegations against New, the administrative officer. <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON> told police that two women claimed to have paid bribes to New to `` fix'' cases, and that one of the women said some of the transactions occurred in <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON>'s presence. New eventually was convicted of bribery. <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> was not indicted. But <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>'s campaign contended that <PERSON> Dolan </PERSON> bore the ultimate responsibility for `` any failure to manage the court or its employees.'' The 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> upheld the award last year, rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION>' arguments that the 1984 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision required a reversal of the jury verdict. The appeals court said the 1984 call for independent appellate review does not apply to a case's facts but instead `` was limited to a review of the ultimate conclusion of clear and convincing proof of actual malice.'' Today, the justices said the 6th Circuit court's language was misleading. The appeals court opinion could appear to mean that a newspaper faces liability if it strays from `` the standards of investigation and reporting ordinarily adhered to by responsible publishers,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said, but that is not the same as ` actual malice.' <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> has since sold the Journal-News. Its new owner is <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Connaughton </PERSON>, 88-10.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> chain of 40 electronics stores, has agreed to pay $ 12.1 million to as many as 15,000 employees and job applicants who were required to take polygraph tests. The settlement comes 18 months after four applicants filed a class-action suit claiming the lie-detector tests violated both a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Labor Code ban on involuntary polygraphs and the state constitutional right to privacy. The agreement, announced Wednesday, is subject to approval by a <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge. `` It tells all employers that workers do not hang up their rights at the door of the workplace,'' <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON>, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in a statement. The suit was filed on behalf of all applicants and employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since Nov. 23, 1983. The company may have given 15,000 polygraph tests since 1983, the plaintiffs said. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON>, chief financial officer for <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the tests were discontinued shortly after <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> bought the <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 for $ 67 million. According to the suit, one woman was told she `` had the job'' before she was given a polygraph test, in which she was asked if she had ever been to a psychiatrist or a therapist. She refused to answer, saying the question was too personal, and was told she was `` neurotic and high strung,'' according to the suit. She did not get the job.

<HEAD>Report Sees Home Ownership Among Young Americans Declining</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Home ownership among young Americans is declining alarmingly and `` threatens to produce a permanent underclass of disadvantaged renters,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study released today said. The annual report on the state of the nation's housing, released by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said the homeownership rate for households in the 25-29 age group fell to 36.2 percent in 1988. In 1980, it was 43.3 percent. For households in the 30-34 age group, the rate fell to 52.6 percent, off nearly 10 percentage points from the 1976 rate of 62.4. The report also said that 30 percent of the nearly 5.7 million unsbsidized housing units renting for less than $ 300 a month are physically inadequate and `` at risk of loss.'' It said single-parent households, accounting for an increasing share of the nation's total population of children, are the most vulnerable to the cost crunch. The median income of a single parent under 25 was $ 6,223 in 1988, down 15 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from 1974, the report said. At the same time, it said, 71 percent of all single-parent households pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent. `` Because it is rooted in fundamental social, economic and demographic factors, this trend is not easily reversed,'' the study said. `` Left unchecked it threatens to produce a permanent underlcass of disadvantaged renters and to jeopardize the long-term financial security of future generations.'' The study offered no specific solutions to the housing problems it identified, saying that they are `` subject to debate'' but that `` policymakers must act to develop creative approaches to advance the goal of decent housing for all.'' The study was co-authored by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Apgar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPasquale </PERSON>, professors at the joint center.

 A traveling lightning-rod salesman has been ordered to return thousands of dollars bilked from senior citizens and has been banished from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> for five years. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherlock </PERSON>, 47, pleaded guilty Wednesday to home-improvement fraud for selling shoddy and overpriced rods.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> opposes an international effort to ban the ivory trade, a government spokesman said today. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Botswana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, which must cull their elephants to keep the population under control, say such a ban could drive up the price of illegal ivory and does n't take into account legal ivory exports that generate income for conservation programs. `` Our basic position is that we do not support a total ban on the ivory trade worldwide,'' said <PERSON> Bosman </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> wanted to make its position known but does not plan to campaign in support of ivory trade. `` In <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> we have a very healthy elephant population that must be culled or it will simply destroy its own environment,'' he said. `` The selling of the ivory in a legal manner makes good sense.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> earns $ 2 million annually from the sale of elephant tusks at the culling program in Kruger National Park, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> said. The money is spent on animal research and maintaining the park, he added. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>, chairman of the Zimbabwean conservation group the <ORGANIZATION> Zambezi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said there is a question whether bans `` really work or whether they merely raise prices and drive trade underground.'' Soaring ivory prices in the last decade have fueled a killing spree that has cut <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s elephant population from an estimated 1.5 million in the 1970s to less than 700,000 today, experts say. An average tusk weighs 11 pounds and can fetch $ 109 a pound on the international market. This month, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have imposed bans on ivory imports that make elephant poaching profitable. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> consume up to 75 percent of the ivory in world markets. The 102-member Convention In Trade Of Endangered Species will consider such a ban in an October meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, one country that supports a total ban on the trade, today announced plans to destroy 12 tons of ivory the government has seized from poachers, and it urged other nations to do the same.

 Rising water forced hundreds of people from their homes in northern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s governor ordered the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to help three flooded communities. A week of nearly steady rain threatened crops in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and pushed rivers and creeks out of their banks in the Southeast and <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms were forecast for the area today, and flood watches went up <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Carolinas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Showers and thunderstorms developed today over the <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, with the heaviest rain over <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, where 6.80 inches fell at <LOCATION> Stanton </LOCATION> and 6.20 inches fell near <LOCATION> Vallisca </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Ridgway </LOCATION>, about 200 people were evacuated Tuesday and Wednesday before the Clarion River crested at about 6 feet over flood stage, said county Emergency Management Coordinator <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zettle </PERSON>. The water covered <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>'s main bridge. In <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, about 300 people were evacuated at <LOCATION> Brockway </LOCATION> and nearby <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION>, and about 15 families sought higher ground at <LOCATION> Reynoldsville </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Brockway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Bish </PERSON> said officials ordered the evacuation as a precaution because a dike holding back <LOCATION> Toby </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> has been temporarily lowered from 16 feet to 14 feet for the construction of a bridge. The <LOCATION> Monongahela </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> overflowed Wednesday onto the wharf in downtown <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where hundreds of commuters park every day. Some were forced to use buckets to remove water from their cars. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> ordered National Guardsmen to deliver sandbags to families in <LOCATION> Bingham </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Elmore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and water to 300 residents in the <LOCATION> Plantersville </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> where a water system shut down. Emergency management officials said heavy rain washed out a bridge and ruptured water lines. Cotton fields were reported under water in the county. `` A year ago our farmers were praying for rain. Now, many of those same farmers are wondering when it's going to end,'' said <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Myrick </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. Early today, high wind during a thunderstorm downed trees at <LOCATION> Cullman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, and during the six-hour period up to 8 a.m. EDT, <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> got an additional 2.55 inches of rain. In <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Colquitt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, rain has combined with high temperature to spread two fungus-based diseases to cucumbers, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Extension </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent. The diseases could cost some cucumber growers half their harvest, he said. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, rain has hampered harvesting of the roughly 20 percent of the wheat crop that remains in the field, agriculture officials said, but the moisture has been a blessing for crops such as peanuts, corn, soybeans, tobacco and cotton, which will be harvested later in the year. Early today, residents in two central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> communities piled up sandbags around the banks of the Licking River in an attempt to hold back flood waters that threatened their homes and businesses. While rain plagued the eastern portion of the nation, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> was dealing with another form of precipitation on the first day of summer Wednesday. Rain turned to snow at elevations above 7,500 feet in <LOCATION> Teller </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Evergreen </LOCATION> area west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Light snow was falling early today over the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> mountains, at Evergreen and at <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, with a fresh 8-inch covering at <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Evans </LOCATION>. `` Happy summer, huh?'' complained a dispatcher for the <ORGANIZATION> Teller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today made it easier for communities to turn down the volume on rock concerts, upholding <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s effort to avoid ear-splitting noise levels in Central Park. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said officials may require sponsors of rock concerts in the park's <ORGANIZATION> Naumberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acoustic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bandshell </ORGANIZATION> to use a sound system operated by a city-designated engineer. That requirement does not violate the freedom-of-expression guarantees of the Constitution's First Amendment, Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> wrote for the court. The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that said city officials had to devise a `` less restrictive'' way to satisfy their concern over noise levels. `` This less-restrictive-alternative analysis has never been a part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place and manner regulation'' on expression, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. He added: `` The city's sound amplification guideline is narrowly tailored to serve the substantial and content-neutral governmental interests of avoiding excessive sound volume and providing sufficient amplification within the bandshell concertground. `` Accordingly, it is valid under the First Amendment as a reasonable regulation of the place and manner of expression,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. In a dissenting opinion, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the court `` plays to our shared impatience with loud noise to obscure the damage that it does to our First Amendment rights.'' Calling <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s requirement for a city-run sound system at rock concerts `` an impermissible prior restraint,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said, `` Because judgments that sounds are too loud, noise-like, or discordant can mask disapproval of the music itself, government control of the sound-mixing equipment necessitates detailed and neutral standards.'' Quoting one music critic, the 80-year-old <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> added, `` New music always sounds loud to old ears.'' He was joined in dissent by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The city's noise-control campaign is aimed at protecting visitors to the park's neighborhing <ORGANIZATION> Sheep </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meadow </ORGANIZATION>, a 13-acre area decreed a `` quiet zone'' by Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in 1985, and residents of a fashionable neighborhood called Central Park West. The city policy was challenged by Rock Against Racism, which sponsors an annual bandshell program of speakers and musical groups. The case is <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> vs. Rock Against Racism, 88-226.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is skeptical of a Soviet proposal to seek advice from the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s permanent members on proposed elections among Palestinian Arabs on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, administration sources say. And Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, appearing today on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, again registered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> opposition to moves by the Soviets and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> for an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` We have tried to discourage the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> from pressing forward,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` ... It could be detrimental to the prospects for direct negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the Palestinians.'' But at the proper time, and `` properly structured,'' an international conference could be helpful, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said some supporters of a conference were now inclined to give the idea of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> elections a chance to develop. He did not identify the countries under questioning by the committee. As for apporaching the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> about elections, an official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said late Wednesday: `` We said we were n't interested.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not reject the idea outright. But, the official said it was unlikely to get anywhere `` as far as we're concerned. The official said the proposal could complicate efforts to hold elections to choose <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> representatives to negotiate self-rule with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` It would only muddy the waters and distract from the -LRB- elections -RRB- idea itself,'' the official said. Participation by the council members would guarantee the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a role that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> fears would be used to the advantage of the Arabs. The five members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The Soviets, without committing themselves on Palestinian elections, made their proposal during a two-day meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> last week on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. It was one in a series of conferences on various global problems arranged by the two superpowers. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation was headed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for the <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, head of the department's policy planning staff. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON>, senior expert on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, led his government's delegation. The Soviet idea was first disclosed in Thursday editions of The Star Tribune of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. The elections were proposed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> as a way of breaking the stalemate between the Arabs and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The idea has qualified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, provided arrangements are satisfactory to the Palestinians and the Arab countries. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has rejected <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s offer as a subterfuge to block the creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is operating on the assumption that the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposal still has a chance and in any event is the only known vehicle for starting negotiations. For this reason, the official said, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> proposal to consult the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members on a proper framework received a skeptical <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response. The official said the Soviets did not endorse or reject <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s proposition As in the past, the Soviets said only that it was `` worthy of consideration.'' In the past, as an inducement to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the Soviets have said they would be prepared to resume diplomatic relations once negotiations began. But the official said the Soviets did not repeat this offer in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> sessions. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defeated a combination of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries in a six-day war.

<HEAD>Court Rules Government May Confiscate Money from Criminal Defendants</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 17-23, In other action, with other cases.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today the government may confiscate from criminal defendants money and property they intended to use to pay their legal fees. The justices, in separate 5-4 votes in cases from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, handed federal prosecutors a major victory in their fight against illegal drug dealing. The court said a defendant's constitutional rights to due process and to be represented by a lawyer in a criminal case are not violated when profits of an allegedly illegal enterprise are seized. Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who wrote for the court in both cases, said no one has a constitutional right `` to spend another person's money for services rendered by an attorney, even if those funds are the only way that that defendant will be able to retain the attorney of his choice The money, though in his possession, is not rightfully his.'' He was joined by Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, in a dissenting opinion, said, `` It is unseemly and unjust for the government to beggar those it prosecutes in order to disable their defense at trial.'' He said the court `` should heed the warnings'' of federal trial judges who `` understand, perhaps far better than we, the devastating consequences of attorney's fee forfeiture for the integrity of our adversarial system of justice.'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> was joined by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. In one case decided today, the law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Caplin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON> here was denied $ 170,000 in legal fees for representing <PERSON> Chistopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Reckmeyer </PERSON>. He pleaded guilty in 1985 in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> to charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role as kingpin of a multi-million-dollar drug operation. <PERSON> Reckmeyer </PERSON> was sentenced to 17 years in prison and was ordered to forfeit all proceeds from the drug deals. The seizure of the money left him without funds to pay <ORGANIZATION> Caplin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON>. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last year that <PERSON> Reckmeyer </PERSON> was not entitled to use any of the money to reimburse the law firm. In the second case, the former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration appealed a ruling that would have allowed <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Monsanto </PERSON> access to assets worth $ 400,000 to help him pay his lawyers. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> was convicted in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> of charges he headed a heroin-selling ring. The jury also had ordered him to forfeit to the government a house in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, valued at $ 335,000, a $ 30,000 cooperative apartment in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> and $ 35,000 in cash. But the 2nd U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled last year <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> could use the assets to pay legal fees incurred in his defense. At issue in both cases were forfeiture provisions of key federal crime-fighting laws, including the Continuing Criminal Enterprise Act and the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations statute. In other action, the court: _ Gave cities important new protection against big damage awards when they are accused of violating people's civil rights. By a 5-4 vote, the court narrowed the scope of a century-old civil rights law invoked by a former <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> high school football coach who said he lost his job because he is white. _ Unanimously upheld a $ 200,000 libel award against <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>. However, its ruling did not appear to weaken significantly the news media's protection against libel lawsuits by public officials and public figures. The justices said a federal appeals court correctly ruled against <ORGANIZATION> Harte-Hanks </ORGANIZATION> because of a 1983 article in the <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Journal-News </PERSON>. But the decision also said the appeals court issued a misleading opinion about the standards of reporting and investigation by the media. _ Made it easier for communities to turn down the volume on rock concerts, upholding <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s effort to avoid ear-splitting noise levels in Central Park. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, said officials may require sponsors of rock concerts in the park's <ORGANIZATION> Naumberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acoustic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bandshell </ORGANIZATION> to use a sound system operated by a city-designated engineer. In one of the forfeiture cases, <ORGANIZATION> Caplin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON> and other attorneys argued that confiscating the assets of people when they are indicted will leave them too poor to pay their own lawyers. But White today compared the plight of the accused drug dealer to that of a robbery suspect. A robbery suspect has no constitutional right `` to use funds he has stolen from a bank to retain an attorney to defend him if he is apprehended,'' he said. `` If defendants have a right to spend forfeitable assets on attorney's fees, why not on excercises of the -LRB- constitutional -RRB- right to speak, practice one's religion or travel?'' White asked rhetorically. Also, he said, a defendant's assets may be frozen before conviction if there is probable cause to believe the money or property was obtained illegally. The forfeiture cases are <ORGANIZATION> Caplin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Drysdale </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-1729, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION>, 88-454.

<TEXT>
 Airport officials defended their handling of a program in which lucrative contracts intended to help women and minorities benefited the wife of Rep. <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and other politically well-connected people. `` No one's getting any favors here,'' <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> Commission member <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said at a meeting Wednesday. <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> and her husband, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, earned more than $ 100,000 last year on a 1986 investment of less than $ 15,000 in <LOCATION> Peideau </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>'s financial statement. The companies are part of a joint venture awarded a concession to operate duty-free and gift stores at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, was also involved in the joint venture. Both he and Mrs. <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> have acknowledged that their involvement in running the businesses has been minimal. Like others in the program, they are backers of Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who appoints airport commission members. The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program is intended to encourage companies to invite women and minorities to become partners in airport businesses so they can gain experience to help them compete on their own. Under <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> rules, minority participants are expected to take on day-to-day responsibilities in the businesses. Airport commission Chairman <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and others defended the panel's selection of participants. `` All of the processes took place in a forthright and public fashion,'' said <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airports </ORGANIZATION>. But he acknowledged the matter should be looked into in more detail. The commission hired a consultant to do that.

 A congressional panel investigating influence peddling in federal housing programs wants a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to explain how he was named developer on several lucrative projects to refurbish federally subsidized housing for the poor. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, was one of several witnesses called today to tell the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Government Operations subcommittee on employment and housing how contracts were awarded for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s moderate rehabilitation program. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, a former assistant secretary of housing, led a group that included several other former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and won development contracts for at least seven projects in the West and <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>. `` Abuse and favoritism were pervasive at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> in awarding these scarce and desirable moderate rehabilitation funds,'' said subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif. `` We are eager to hear from these witnesses how projects they pushed came to be selected by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for federal subsidies over many competing projects,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said before the hearing Among <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>'s partners were <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBartolomeis </PERSON>, former general deputy assistant secretary for housing; <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON>, the former director of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> regional office; and <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary. According to a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's report, one proposal from the group to develop 202 units of the Windsong Apartments in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, was chosen after <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> told the local housing authority how it could obtain funding. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> was also scheduled to testify today; <PERSON> DeBartolomeis </PERSON> testified earlier this month. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, a former special assistant to then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, was the first witness. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> received $ 1.3 million in consultant fees in connection with 13 moderate rehabilitation projects. Former Interior Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> told the panel earlier this month that he instructed a developer to send <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> $ 131,000 of the $ 300,000 fee <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> was to receive for a consulting job. <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> testified that he retained <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> in March 1984 as a consultant to his company, <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, because he had problems getting responses from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for his clients. A letter, which <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> read and said formalized his relationship with <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, noted <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>'s `` well developed flair for innovation.'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> if he had hired <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> to use his influence. `` That's what this letter says,'' <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> responded. A <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> inspector general's report said the <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> group `` utilized a number of corporate titles'' to buy projects that might be eligible for the program. The group would approach local housing authorities, advise them to apply to <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for funding and the units and then help local officials prepare solicitations for proposals on the projects. In one instance, <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON> notified the housing authority in <LOCATION> Richland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> it had been awarded 158 units before the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was even aware of the funding, the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> report said.

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has dedicated the church's next World Day of Peace to the ecological crisis, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said Thursday Stressing that the goods of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> must not be used `` for selfish ends, for profit or power alone,'' the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said the need to respect the environment is a new challenge to peace. `` Peace with God the Creator _ Peace with all of Creation'' is the theme for the day, which the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> marks on Jan. 1. The theme chosen by the pope, it said, is an invitation to reflect on the ecological crisis from a moral perspective. `` The <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and all that it contains are a common heritage for humanity. This should be the governing principle for the use of the goods of the Earth by nations and the international community to which these goods are entrusted,'' the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said.

 A solar-powered car's speed test went a little too well when police nabbed the driver for going 55 mph in a 50 mph zone. `` I believe it's the first solar vehicle ever caught for speeding,'' said <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanneret </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bienne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, the car's chief designer. The three-wheeled `` Spider'' was going 5 mph above the speed limit when police stopped it outside this city Monday, <PERSON> Jeanneret </PERSON> said. The incident occurred during road tests after the vehicle's gearbox was changed to improve its performance on the Alpine stages of an upcoming race for solar-powered vehicles through <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> <PERSON> Jeanneret </PERSON> said the modification actually makes the car slower. `` We were lucky,'' he said, noting that the Spider has a maximum speed of nearly 65 mph. He declined to identify the driver, who was fined 20 Swiss francs -LRB- about $ 11.75 -RRB-.

 Malaysian soldiers serving with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> force in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> were accused Thursday of trying to chip souvenirs from the world's largest known meteorite, a Namibian national monument. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials are investigating the incident, which reportedly involved about 36 soldiers who turned up with a truck and began trying to cut pieces from the giant slab near the northern town of <LOCATION> Grootfontein </LOCATION>.

 Underwater explorer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, whose deep-sea robot discovered the German battleship Bismarck on the bottom of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> two weeks ago, said today he believed the World War II vessel had been scuttled by its own crew. At a news conference to disclose details of the discovery, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said the condition of the ship confirmed for him the theory that the vessel was scuttled rather than sunk by British fire in one of the most famous and important naval engagements of the war. `` Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. `` It appears the crew opened it up along its entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said he could only speculate on why the German commander decided to send his vessel to the bottom in May 1941. He said perhaps it carried technologically advanced equipment that the Germans did not want to fall into British hands. `` Maybe the Germans did n't want it taken as a war prize,'' he said. In 1939, after a battle with three smaller British ships, the German pocket battleship <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> <PERSON> Spee </PERSON> was cornered in the neutral port of <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> ordered it scuttled, possibly to prevent the British from learning the secrets of its construction and weapons. In the 1941 battle, the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON>'s four main guns were quickly knocked out of action and the attacking British ships were out of range of the Bismarck's secondary guns, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. With the ship helpless and taking hundreds of hits, its sinking was clearly inevitable, he said. Asked if the Germans could n't have surrendered the ship to save lives, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said there was no mast left on which a white flag could have been hoisted. Asked if the Germans could n't have surrendered by ceasing fire, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said `` in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the German fire had ended. The British ships did halt their gunfire but continued to send torpedos, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. However, he said, the lack of evidence of an implosion in the remains persuaded him that the ship had been blasted open by its own crew rather than sunk by British torpedoes. He said he would keep secret the exact location of the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> and let the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people decide its future fate. The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the robot called Argo, the same device that was used four years ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg. The Bismarck was the most powerful vessel in the <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> when it sank during a battle with the British on May 27, 1941. Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived. The sinking occurred only eight days after the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Gydnia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, for her first operation, intended to attack convoys of merchant shipping and damage British morale at a time when <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power. The British sent the warship Hood after the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON>, but five days after the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> went to sea it sank the Hood with the loss of all but three of the British vessel's crew of 1,419. The Hood was the largest warship in the world until the start of World War II and symbolized British sea power, so its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of the most crucial nature. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> was found `` in a remarkable state of preservation. There does n't appear to be as much damage as I had expected.'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> is a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. The Bismarck was found in more than 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A Roman Catholic priest appeared in court Thursday on charges he sold papal souvenir blankets for more than 10 times the legal price. The state alleged the Rev. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Musonda </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretariat </ORGANIZATION>, and church fund-raiser <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> <PERSON> Musakanya </PERSON> engaged in profiteering by selling 220 blankets for about $ 120 apiece after Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s May 2-4 visit. It was also alleged the Catholic Secretariat did not obtain statutory approval from the trade and commerce ministry to import the blankets. Under government pricing laws, the top price of a blanket was fixed at about $ 9. <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> magistrate <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukubesa </PERSON>, who recessed the hearing to June 26, did not ask <PERSON> Musonda </PERSON> to enter a plea on the charges, which carry the penalty of a fine related to the alleged pricing infringement.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Award of Attorneys' Fees in TWA Bias Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today set aside an award of more than $ 180,000 in attorneys' fees stemming from a 1970 sex-bias lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> by female flight attendants. In a 6-2 decision, the court said people who intervene on the side of defendants in civil rights cases _ but who themselves are not found to have violated anyone's rights _ generally can not be forced to reimburse the lawyer fees incurred by those who successfully sue. The complicated case stems from a lawsuit filed 19 years ago that challenged <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s policy of firing female flight attendants when they became mothers. The suit was resolved in 1979 when <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> agreed to reinstate fired women, and grant them seniority from the date of their dismissal. The airline, which had abandoned its `` no motherhood'' policy soon after the suit was filed, also created a $ 3 million fund for the fired attendants. The settlement was challenged by the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants who could have suffered by being laid off before those with the newly won seniority. The union acted in the case as an intervenor, a concerned third party not named as a plaintiff or defendant. The union's challenge to the settlement ultimately failed, and the 7th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> last year ordered the union to pay $ 180,915 toward the legal fees incurred by the female flight attendants who sued. But the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said today that the appeals court wrongly presumed that the union was liable under a federal law allowing courts to make such lawyer-fee awards. Such intervenors are liable under that law, Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> wrote for the court, only when their intervention is `` frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation.'' The court sent the case back to the 7th Circuit for further study. Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> dissented, and Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> did not participate in the case. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Zipes </PERSON>, 88-608.

<HEAD>Report Finds Home Ownership Among Young Declining</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Home ownership is declining among young Americans but increasing among those 65 and older, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study released Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> said in its annual report on the state of housing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the home ownership rate for those in the 25-34 age group was 45 percent in 1988, down from 52.3 percent in 1980. Among households headed by people 65 and older, however, the rate increased from 72.3 percent in 1980 to 75 percent in 1988. The report said that many of those people already owned homes before housing costs increased in the 1970s and early 1980s. Young people, the study found, are increasingly unable to accumulate the down payment and other costs involved in buying a house. `` This trend is not easily reversed,'' the report said. `` Left unchecked, it threatens to produce a permanent underclass of disadvantaged renters and to jeopardize the long-term financial security of future generations.'' The study was co-authored by <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> professors <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Apgar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPasquale </PERSON>. `` The situation is likely to worsen,'' Ms. <PERSON> DiPasquale </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Federal budget cutbacks and expiring use restrictions threaten the subsidized housing stock.'' The report said inflation-adjusted rents for poor people living in unsubsidized units increased 34 percent from 1974 to 1985. `` As long as these trends persist, the gap between those who can afford decent shelter and those who ca n't will continue to widen,'' <PERSON> Apgar </PERSON> said. Single-parent households, which account for an increasing share of the nation's total population of children, are living in some of the worst housing, the report said. The median income of a single parent under 25 was $ 6,223 in 1988, down 15 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from 1974, the report said. At the same time, 71 percent of all single-parent households pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier who pleaded guilty to espionage charges says he did n't know what he was going to do when he crossed the border to communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a military newspaper reported today. Spec. 4 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty to charges he gave defense secrets to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> when his court martial opened Wednesday. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> could be sentenced to life in prison on the espionage charges. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> disappeared from his unit, the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, on Feb. 21. He returned voluntarily 11 days later. `` I was never really sure what I was going to do at all,'' <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> told the courtoom after changing his plea from not guilty to guilty, according to an account in the Stars and Stripes, the Armed Forces unofficial newspapers. `` I really did n't have a plan. My primary reason was to leave behind all the frustrations and problems at work,'' the newspaper quoted him as saying about his decision to leave his unit. `` Everything had been wrong. I was n't enjoying myself. I wanted to start over somewhere else,'' the Stars and Stripes quoted his as telling the court in response to a question from Col. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON>, the presiding judge. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> disappeared with a lap-top computer from his unit, where he worked in the military intelligence section as an electronic signal interceptor. `` I was looking at Soviet forces on paper -LRB- at work -RRB- and I wanted to see it firsthand,'' the newspaper quoted his as saying. `` I took the computer to run the software because I did n't think the Soviets would have one. It was a bargaining chip to keep them from doing something to me. It would show them that I was n't an American plant,'' the paper quoted him as telling the court. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> said he used a multipurpose military vehicle to drive to the East German border because it was a headquarters vehicle and would not arouse suspicion inside the half-mile zone along the border, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers can not enter without authorization. After abandoning the vehicle near the border, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> said he climbed over the border fence, using angled support posts as a ladder, according to Stars and Stripes. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> said he walked to an East German border command tower and was spotted by soldiers who took him to a nearby barracks. `` They were surprised when I told them how I came over and got so far before being seen,'' the Stars and Stripes quoted him as saying. He was then taken by unidentified civilians to a house in East Belrin, where he was questioned about the secret documents he brought on the computer software, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> told the court, according to the paper. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> told the judge he did n't realize how extensive the information was until he returned to <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION> and was questioned by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials, the newspaper said. On March 3, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> told the East Germans he wanted to leave and was allowed to go back with the computer and the software, the Stars and Stripes said. He was charged with espionage on March 16. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, and sister, <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were at Wednesday' court session, Stars and Stripes said.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tourists coming for the bicentennial of the French Revolution next month may find out that they picked the worst of times. They will have to stay in a hotel far from the capital. A parking space in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> might be just as tough to get. Motorcades for the 30 or so presidents and prime ministers will whiz through streets, and authorities will deploy 30,000 police _ two-thirds from out of town _ during the July 11-17 peak of festivities. Tourists flock to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> every summer, but officials say the number of visitors already is considerably larger than last year. During the bicentennial period, about 3 million tourists are expected to flood this city of 2.3 million people. With a bit of luck, a tourist can still find a room this month. Next month _ forget it. `` Impossible,'' says a woman at the hotel reservations counter of the Tourist Office on the Champs-Elysees. `` You'll have to go at least 100 kilometers -LRB- 60 miles -RRB- outside of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is booked solid.'' Many VIPs will be attending a July 14-16 summit of the seven major industrial nations, and their entourages will fill hundreds of hotel rooms. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is coming to town July 4-6, followed by <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Also attending celebrations are 10 African presidents, six <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents, six <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> presidents, and six prime ministers or presidents from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, with baggage. Among those attending is President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The elaborate preparations for the foreign leaders have left many people grumbling. `` Allowing a few dozen privileged people to be lodged and to move about tranquilly must not in any way be done to the detriment of hundreds of thousands of other people,'' elected officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wrote to President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. Police have put together a security and traffic strategy worthy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For the crucial week of July 10-17, parts of central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> will be off - limits to all motor vehicle traffic and no cars allowed to park on the streets All vehicles must be removed from those areas. Permits must be sought for delivery trucks and residents heading for garages. Taxis may carry passengers into the areas. Special parking lots are being set up in the <LOCATION> Bois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bois </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Boulogne </PERSON>, forests on the east and west extremities of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. That could seriously upset the thriving transvestite prostitution business in the woods. Officials have played down the inconvenience. `` At least once in our lifetime, we will have seen the heart of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> without cars, without trucks, without exhaust fumes, without backfiring motors,'' said Premier <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>. The Louvre will be shut down July 13-15 for security reasons while delegations gather at the art museum for sessions. And the `` bateaux mouches,'' the tourist boats that ply the <LOCATION> Seine </LOCATION>, will drop anchor those three days because they will not be allowed to use their Alma bridge terminal. July 14 is Bastille Day, the 200th anniversary of the storming of Bastille Prison that started the revolution. The Tourist Office said about 100 families have responded so far to calls for private citizens to rent rooms to visitors. `` And we certainly will have more,'' says <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Quercia </PERSON>, director of the Champs-Elysees office. `` If you have any problems, come and see us.''

 A 72-year-old American nun was shot in the head and critically wounded by an assailant who fired into a truck carrying her and two other nuns, the woman's priest and a co-worker said today. Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON> was shot Wednesday night as she was traveling from the capital to <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>, 10 miles to the south, Father <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> and Sister <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON> told reporters at the <LOCATION> Policlinica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Sister <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON> was driving the pickup truck carrying Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON> and another nun of the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, an order based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. Sister <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON> said a yellow pickup truck carrying at least six men _ four of them in the back of the truck _ pulled alongside their vehicle. `` They stayed alongside and pulled closer, and I did n't understand what was going on Then I heard a noise and thought they had bumped us. I did n't realize it was a bullet,'' she said. The single shot broke the side window and entered Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON>'s skull at the left temple The identities of the attackers were not known. Earlier, hospital sources said <PERSON> Sister </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON> was in serious condition after being operated on Wednesday night. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sister </PERSON> <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON> described her condition as critical. The nuns work with <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> at a home for war orphans in <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>. Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, is a registered nurse and in charge of the clinic at the <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION> orphanage. Some Salvadoran armed forces officers consider nuns, priests and other church people who work in poor communities sympathizers of leftist guerrillas battling the U.S.-backed government in the 9-year-old civil war. In December 1980, four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> churchwomen _ three nuns and one lay worker _ were killed by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The case led to a temporary suspension of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to this country. Five National Guardsmen were convicted of the murders in 1984 and sentenced to 30 years in prison. The men said the church workers were `` subversives.'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> founded the <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION> orphanage, the <ORGANIZATION> Oscar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arnulfo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, in 1980, and the nuns were headed there when the attack occurred. The orphanage is named after the Salvadoran archbishop murdered in March 1980. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said neither he nor the sisters had received threats, and he said the crime did not appear to have been politically motivated. `` There were at least six men in the truck, and only one weapon,'' he said. `` They may have been thieves. Maybe they were drunk.'' Sister <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON> said she and her two companions had stopped at the bank before heading for <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION>. She said the other nun in their vehicle, Sister <PERSON> Juana </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, saw a man standing in the back of the yellow pickup fire the single shot. Sister <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON> said she pulled to the shoulder and stopped and that the yellow pickup stopped up ahead of her vehicle. When she began driving again, the assailant's car sped away. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said <PERSON> Policlinica </PERSON> doctors attending Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON> believe she will survive. He said if she survives she will lose her left eye. If she stabilizes enough, she will probably be flown to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for further treatment, he said.

Despite his ordeal, the 32-year-old Belgian doctor told a news conference one week after his release that he was ready to return to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> if his safety was guaranteed. `` I have seen so much misery and distress that hundreds of doctors could work for hundreds of years to help,'' he said of the conditions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camps, where he worked before his kidnap. Cools, a member of the Marxist relief group Medicine for the People, read a statement on his ordeal to reporters but declined to answer questions, saying he was still too tired. His statement shed no light on the identity of his kidnappers. The Soldiers of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Iran fundamentalist group in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, claimed it kidnapped him near the southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> city of Tyre on May 21, 1988 and held him for 13 months. Cools said he never knew for how long he would be held until the tiny window of his cell swung open on June 14, and a guard told him: `` Get up.'' Cools said his first reaction was: `` They are going to shoot me.'' `` But it was soon clear it meant my release. It is a moment I will never forget in my life.'' He was freed one day later, after intervention by a Belgian government minister. He rested several days in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and arrived in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on a Belgian military plane Sunday. Belgian officials have said no ransom was paid. In his statement, Cools spoke of his capture, his insecurity about his fate and the plight of his parents and friends. He was kept in a room so small he could barely stand or stretch, but for the first six months, guards were friendly and food was good and plentiful. `` I had to watch out that I did not get any fatter,'' Cools said. After five days, he was even given a radio. He said temperatures in his cell reached 111 degrees at times and that guards occasionally fanned him with a tray to cool him off. But in November, the conditions of his imprisonment worsened for no apparent reason. Guards took his radio and watch. All openings in the wall of his room were sealed in December, making it impossible to tell night from day. `` I started to cry,'' Cools said. Cools said he was allowed only 10 showers in eight months. His hands would get so greasy he could no longer button his shirt, he said. He said he tried to keep time by listening to barking dogs at night, or looking at the expiration date on the containers of yogurt he was given. He knew it was the end of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, the month of fasting in the Moslem year, when guards offered him the traditional sweets. `` I sometimes was very desperate, but I never lost confidence in a happy ending.'' What kept him going was the belief `` that I came to help people,'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, Cools said. `` I made no mistake. -LRB- The abductors -RRB-, in fact made a mistake.'' Cools was released after a meeting between Belgian Trade Minister <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbain </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> last week. <PERSON> Urbain </PERSON> then left for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where Cools was handed over to him. <PERSON> Urbain </PERSON> said the release was obtained `` without giving back anything, without compromise.'' Fourteen foreigners are believed held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including nine Americans. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He was abducted March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Routine Cholesterol Screening Recommended for Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A private research and education organization urged routine cholesterol testing in children Thursday, saying high levels go undetected in many youngsters. Cholesterol should be checked at some point from ages 2 to 10 `` and the sooner the better,'' said <PERSON> Ernst </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynder </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. High cholesterol can lead to disease in the arteries that feed the heart muscle. That sets the stage for a heart attack in adult life. The American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> recommends childhood cholesterol testing only if a child's family history suggests he is at risk. But that strategy overlooks many children with high cholesterol, <PERSON> Wynder </PERSON> said in a recent interview. Children are considered at risk if their fathers have had a heart attack, for example, but a young father may not have had his heart attack while the child is still young, <PERSON> Wynder </PERSON> said. The health foundation said research shows that some 5 percent to 15 percent of children in industrialized countries have excessive cholesterol levels, using the adult standard of 200 milligrams per deciliter or more. Almost a third are above 175 milligrams per deciliter, which may be a more appropriate marker for children, the foundation said. <PERSON> Wynder </PERSON> said screening all children would be cost-effective because it would reduce such later costs as those of coronary bypass operations and time off work from heart attacks. The heart association's recommendation was published in 1986. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON>, a member of the committee that developed it, said it was based on the state of cholesterol-testing technology and knowledge about childhood cholesterol at that time. `` We felt we were n't ready'' for universal childhood screening, he said in a recent interview. Now such screening is being studied by a committee organized by the National Heart, Lung and <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON> said. The heart association is awaiting the committee's conclusions before deciding on any change in its recommendation, said association spokesman <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. The health foundation said a feasible target for children's cholesterol is 140 milligrams per deciliter <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON> agreed that is `` a goal to shoot for'' but said diet and exercise will not be enough to reach it in all children. So medications may be needed, he said.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants to stress <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> outrage over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on the democracy movement without pressing that nation to the point where `` its only real prospect for reaching out to the world is back toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nominee for assistant secretary of state for East Asian and <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> affairs, said that `` only <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> can answer the question whether it can now return to the path of reform.'' <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s policy planning staff, appeared at an Asian policy conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a private research organization. Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, another speaker, described <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a `` tragedy of old men holding onto power by executing their own grandchildren.'' He added that `` I hope I'm wrong but I believe our relations with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are going to get worse for a long time.'' <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON> said that a new leadership in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` would give everybody the opportunity for a way out'' of the current situation. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said that prospects of continued openness and stability in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` are now clouded by repression and possibly turning inward if not returning to centralized management.'' He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy-makers face a challenge of balancing `` the totally appropriate outrage our people feel about the violent massacre inflicted on peaceful Chinese demonstrators'' with the desirability of not pushing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s arms. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said that the policy-makers want to express that outrage without pushing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` into a situation where its only real prospect of reaching out to the world is back toward the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He said another challenge of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> policy is to `` better manage'' relations with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which form `` the keystone of our dealings in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>,'' and preventing trade and technology disputes from undermining them. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said the administration does not favor a free trade arrangement with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that would exclude other <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> countries but seeks a regional consensus on `` some form of appropriate mutilateral mechanism'' to deal with trade, financial, technological and environmental issues. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will unveil such proposals in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> speech Monday and during an Asian tour, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. He also said the administration is `` gearing up for a major diplomatic effort'' for a peace process in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> that will spare the Cambodians from a new civil war and allow them to choose their own government after the expected end of the Vietnamese occupation later this year. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also needs to `` reaffirm the consensus which has been underpinning security'' since World War II in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. He said the situation in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> `` remains highly explosive'' because North Korean leaders are not undertaking the kind of reforms `` we see in much of the communist world.''

 With the minds of engineers and the spirits of pioneers, 18 teams are gambling their reputations and their survival in the first human-powered submarine races. `` There's both a fun and serious side to the races,'' said <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> Linskey </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, director of The H.A. <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Hingham </LOCATION>, Mass.-based undersea research group that, along with <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raton </ORGANIZATION>, organized the three-day event starting Friday. `` We want to see the type of materials used and what shape performs the best,'' Ms. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> said. `` There could be a commercial and recreational application for human-powered subs.'' And for the competitors, who will race their two-person craft 1,000 feet offshore in about 20 feet of water, there's the spice of a $ 5,000 overall performance prize and several smaller cash awards for design and efficiency. The lightweight subs _ with one person steering and the other in the `` crankman'' seat providing the pedal power _ will race head-to-head over a one-kilometer course. The eight winners of Friday's first rounds will move on to elimination rounds over the weekend. The subs will tow surface floats to mark their progress, about the pace of a brisk walk. All the subs are `` wet'' designs that fill up with water and require the crews to wear scuba gear. For most entrants, the nearly 18 months of design and construction was plotted on computers and bankrolled by universities or corporate sponsors. A few, however, pulled the car out of the family garage for their work space. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibolt </PERSON> and two co-workers at the <ORGANIZATION> David </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, combed junk yards for parts. The crew seats are old plastic cafeteria chairs, and an old 10-speed bike was converted into the sub's gear system. They dubbed the 600-pound fiberglass sub `` The Turtle'' after the first human-powered sub, built in 1775 but abandoned after its first unsuccessful mission to sink British ships in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` Hope we have better luck,'' said <PERSON> Leibolt </PERSON>. `` We literally funded this by passing around a hat in the office.'' In <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, an auto shop donated a pink-and-green paint job for the independent `` Sub-Human.'' `` We sort of winged it,'' said crankman <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, who still shivers when he recalls the first test run in <LOCATION> 46-degree </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. While most of the subs resemble sleek torpedos, many teams boasted of subtle differences. `` Ours may look like some of the others, but there's one difference: Ours is fastest,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, a back-up navigator for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Icarus,'' which uses a cable-and-pulley propulsion system rather than the more common chain-and-gear `` We designed ours in a perfect hydrodynamic shape,'' said <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> mechanical engineering graduate <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Poor </PERSON>. `` It should slice right through the water.'' The `` Gossamer Albacor,'' built by <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, was one of two entries using a waving fish-tail propulsion device rather than propellers. `` We're looking at all things: the cleverness of design and the materials used,'' said engineer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, one of six judges assigned to award $ 500 prizes for cost effectiveness and innovation. `` Anyone can build something with a blank check. I'll be looking for some real imagination.'' Surely, 73-year-old <PERSON> Calvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gongwer </PERSON>'s `` Knuckle Ball'' will not go unnoticed. <PERSON> Gongwer </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Innerspace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, will be the navigator inside his 60-inch-diameter plastic sphere. `` There are some ideas I want to test out with spheres underwater,'' said <PERSON> Gongwer </PERSON>. `` Looks are n't everything.'' On the beach, <ORGANIZATION> Perry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> President H.A. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> watched all the preparations. `` The response has been four of five times what we imagined,'' said <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>. `` At first we thought we'd have a few subs, a few races and a keg of beer. We did n't expect this.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today called upon all American citizens and institutions to join a voluntary crusade to fight poverty, drugs and other societal ills by extending national service `` into every corner of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Bringing a campaign metaphor to life, he unveiled his blueprint for a foundation called the `` Points of Light Initiative'' that would get $ 25 million a year in taxpayers' funds to spur Americans to volunteer for social service. He made the pitch in a speech for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Partnership </LOCATION>, a civic group, after touring a shelter for runaway youth called Covenant House. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also named <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> to head an advisory committee that will recommend legislation to achieve the foundation's goals and propose a structure for the organization. `` I ask all Americans and all American institutions, large and small, to make service central to your life and work,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` We know that during the past two decades we have spent more money, on more social programs, than at any time in our history. And some problems are n't better. In fact, they're worse.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` too many Americans still endure a living nightmare of want and isolation. That must stop.'' `` The key to constructive change is building relationships, not bureaucracies,' he said. `` Today, more than ever, we need community service to help drop-outs, pregnant teens and drug abusers; the homeless and AIDS victim; the hungry and illiterate.'' Invoking again the guiding metaphor of his campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he wanted to unleash the energy of every citizen, school, business, church and synagogue and civic group. `` This is what I mean when I talk of ` a thousand points of light' _ that vast galaxy of people and institutions working together to solve problems in their own back yard,'' he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was asking both the public and private sector, including all branches of government, to `` join this great movement to extend national service into every corner of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' He urged every church and synagogue to `` become an around-the-clock community center,'' every restaurant and grocery to distribute surplus food to soup kitchens and shelters, every corporation to teach illiterate employees to read, and every college to start a Big Brother or Big Sister program. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that in addition to the Youth Engaged in Service to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> program -LRB- YES -RRB- announced Wednesday, the new foundation will include a `` ServNet Project'' that will encourage corporations, professional firms and other groups to donate the services of their top talent. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the YES program will select annually two college-age youth from each state to serve as roving service ambassadors and salespeople. `` We know that volunteerism can help those free-falling through society,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. At <ORGANIZATION> Covenant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a shelter near Times Square, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> heard 11 young residents tell of their lives on the streets. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cradled a three-week-old baby of one of the youths as they spoke. <PERSON> Monique </PERSON>, 20, said of her life on the streets, `` You do n't want to be there.'' She said as a child she was beaten at home, `` tied up and hung over a spiral staircase.'' <PERSON> Walter </PERSON>, 18, told the president that kids wound up on the streets because `` It's hard to get good jobs. Working in McDonald's at the minimum wage _ it just does n't pay.'' He said that he could make $ 100 `` in 15 minutes'' selling drugs. He said his father was an alcoholic and his mother was dead. The White House billed the new community service drive as a potential panacea for a welter of social problems, from drug abuse to homelessness, and said it could be ` the most comprehensive and inclusive movement of our time.'' During his acceptance speech at the Republican convention last Aug. 18 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> first spoke of what he called the `` brilliant diversity'' of volunteerism in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, shining `` like a thousand points of light'' across society. The metaphor drew guffaws from Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to the theme repeatedly and promised to help spur volunteerism with a <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> initiative.

 The horde of squealing youngsters knew how to get to Sesame Street on Thursday: Follow the yellow bird, just as millions of kids have done watching television for the last two decades. The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> saluted the 20th anniversary of the popular public television show with lavish oratory at the ceremonial opening of a `` Sesame Street'' exhibition at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> Visiting preschoolers swarmed past grown-up dignitaries and TV cameramen to jostle happily around Mr. <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>'s storefront. At the window ledge was Elmo, their old Muppet friend. The friendly, red-faced animal, operated by puppeteer <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Clash </PERSON>, waved back and spoke to the youngsters who reached out to grasp his paws. The children giggled at Oscar the Grouch, scowling from his trash can, and peered up at the 8-foot-2-inch yellow majesty of Big Bird. Along the lower walls of the museum, they twirled clear plastic wheels to form funny faces and searched a train picture to count the hidden letter T's. `` The one thing kids wo n't learn on ` Sesame Street' is the difference between education and fun,'' said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Roney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, the exhibition curator. `` Sesame Street,'' created by <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooney </PERSON>'s non-profit Children's Television Workshop to help disadvantaged children age 3 to 5 make the transition from home to school, made its public television debut Nov. 10, 1969. In the last two decades, the hour-long show has won 36 Emmys and is seen regularly in more than 11 million households each week. The English-language version is seen in more than 80 countries. Producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> V.B </PERSON>. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> estimated the show has 40 million `` graduates,'' not counting tens of millions of parents who also watch. <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> was accompanied by <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, the actress who has played <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> the nurse on `` Sesame Street'' since it began. Long is a professional educator with a Ph.D. in urban education. Museum director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the show's creators had prevailed against `` the greed, heedlessness and irresponsibility of much of network television'' to produce a program that has `` made an immense difference in the tone of our culture.'' `` It is not only a TV program, it's a proclamation that there are people, even in the TV industry, who are n't going to give up on it, they're staying with it and producing something that is good,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` That's heroism.'' The exhibition includes more than 50 photographs recalling two decades of `` Sesame Street'' programming. Besides the show's familiar Muppet characters, objects on display include the Sesame Street lamp post and sign, original story boards and a production slate used in filming. When the exhibition closes at summer's end, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> will join the museum's permanent history of American entertainment collection, alongside <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>'s ruby slippers from `` The Wizard of Oz,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagman </PERSON>'s cowboy hat from TV's `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and <PERSON> Archie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunker </PERSON>'s wing chair from `` All In The Family. For the record, Big Bird likes birdseed sandwiches, while <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON>'s favorite treat is an ice cream sundae topped with pickles and sardines

<TEXT>
 A sled dog lost in poor weather during a climbing expedition on <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McKinley </LOCATION> has turned up, weak but alive, after 18 days on the ice-covered mountain. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuveri </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chamonix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, assumed the dog had fallen in a crevasse and died after it disappeared May 31. The Tuveris had four dogs in harness when they started mushing up <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s tallest peak. On the sixth day of the journey, while descending to their camp at the 11,000-foot level after ferrying supplies higher, they unhitched the dogs because of treacherous ice conditions. By the time they got around Windy Corner at 13,200 feet, only three dogs were with them. A 15-month-old Siberian husky named <PERSON> Oukiok </PERSON> was gone. A snowstorm forced the Tuveris to hole up for the next four days. When they climbed to a medical research camp at 14,200 feet, they asked other climbers if they had seen the dog. None had and they assumed he had fallen to his death. With only three dogs left, the Tuveris abandoned their sled and simply climbed to the 20,320-foot summit with the dogs. It was only the second expedition to reach the top with dogs. The Tuveris left the mountain for some sightseeing around <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, then returned to <LOCATION> Talkeetna </LOCATION>, near the mountain, to pick up the remaining dogs for the trip back to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. That's where they learned that, 18 days after he disappeared, <PERSON> Oukiok </PERSON> had walked into the high basin where the medical camp is located. Denali National Park rangers said the dog did n't have any broken bones, but was exhausted. `` It would seem pretty spectacular but it's not impossible,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, chief veterinarian for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. Snow and ice could provide enough liquid to prevent death through dehydration, he said. The dog was being nursed back to health by staff members at the research camp. <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> said he should soon have enough strength to make the trip to the <LOCATION> Kahiltna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Glacier </LOCATION> base camp at 7,200 feet. From there he will be flown to <LOCATION> Talkeetna </LOCATION>, hopefully in time to accompany the Tuveris and the other three dogs back to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> on Monday.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today declared that, while he would support the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision backing the right of protesters to burn the American flag, `` flag burning is wrong _ dead wrong.'' `` The flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is very, very special,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, departing from the text of a speech on volunteerism to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Partnership </LOCATION>, a civic group. The president made the flag a major focus of his 1988 presidential campaign, even giving a stump speech outside a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> flag factory.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has declared an emergency at the state penitentiary at <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in the wake of 11 escapes, four fatal stabbings and four suicides in 14 months. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Polozola </PERSON>, in an order signed Wednesday, appointed <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former warden, to oversee an investigation. <PERSON> Polozola </PERSON> ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamonica </PERSON> to conduct any necessary criminal or civil investigations. The judge noted that the 11 prisoners who escaped since April 1988 were serving long-term sentences for serious crimes, including murder, rape and kidnapping. Ten have been captured. `` While the court understands escapes will occur in a prison, it appears escapes at the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> State Penitentiary are occurring on a more frequent basis and are beginning to affect the lives and property of the general public,'' <PERSON> Polozola </PERSON> wrote. The judge said some prison deaths apparently resulted from drugs and weapons being smuggled into the prison, where the weapons were used to retaliate against those who failed to pay for the drugs. Warden <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said he has a good record of keeping violence at <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to a minimum, noting there have been only three murders this year. `` There were three murders in one night under <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. `` When everything is dug out, you'll find out my record is better than the man who's investigating me.'' `` I think the judge is sincere, but he's getting bad information,'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. Corrections Secretary <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said Wednesday he and Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Polozola </PERSON> several weeks ago and again last week to discuss the prison. <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> approved of the appointment of <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>, an aide said. <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>, 50, was warden in 1976 and 1977 and from 1981 to 1984.

<HEAD>Economy Expanded at 4.4 Percent Annual Rate in First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy expanded at a 4.4 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, but the overall growth rate masked a significant slowdown in business activity, the government reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gross national product, the country's total output of goods and services, rose at the fastest rate in more than a year during the first quarter. However, more than half of the increase resulted from a statistical rebound from last year's drought, a one-time accounting change necessary to return expected farm production this year to its pre-drought levels. Discounting this change, the non-farm economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of 1.9 percent in the first quarter, down from a non-farm growth rate of 3.5 percent in the final three months of 1988. Economists have been predicting for some time that economic growth will slow markedly this year under the impact of high interest rates engineered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to cool off inflationary pressures. On the inflation front, a price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 4.6 percent in the first three months of the year, a less worrisome figure than a 5 percent increase estimated a month ago. The improvement came from slower price increases for farm products and industrial supplies. The effect of the economic slowdown was evident in a companion report that showed the after-tax profits of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations fell by 1.1 percent in the first three months of 1989. The decline, which was revised from an even larger 1.7 percent estimated drop a month ago, was the first setback for corporate profits since a 2.5 percent fall in the first quarter of 1987. Economists said the new GNP report was a generally favorable sign that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can engineer a soft-landing with slower growth and less inflation without pushing the country into a recession. `` The Federal Reserve seems to be getting precisely what it asked for,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We have an economy that is continuing to expand but at a subdued rate.'' Many analysts believe that the country has now entered what is termed a growth recession, a period when the economy keeps growing but at such a sluggish pace that unemployment rises. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, predicted that the unemployment rate, now at 5.2 percent, would climb to 5.9 percent early next year. She forecast GNP growth in the second quarter of around 1.8 percent, very much like the non-farm increase in the first three months of the year. In the second half of 1989, she predicted growth would slow to around 1 percent, but without a recession. `` It is still our bet that we can avoid a recession,'' she said. `` The new GNP report provides further ammunition for those arguing for a soft landing.'' The primary reason for the slight upward revision in the overall 4.4 percent GNP figure, up from a 4.3 percent estimate a month ago, was a better performance in trade than previously believed. The country's huge trade deficit, which had been getting worse since last spring, narrowed significantly in the first quarter and business investment shot up substantially. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, as measured by the GNP, narrowed by $ 19.5 billion in the first quarter as exports shot up by 15 percent and imports fell by 0.5 percent while business investment advanced by 7.6 percent, rebounding from a 2.9 percent decline in the fourth quarter. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is counting on both trade and business investment to be strong this year to keep the economy moving forward while consumer spending slackens. Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity, rose at a sluggish annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter, reflecting in part weak auto sales. Housing construction, which also has been hard hit by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-inflation campaign, dropped by 4.6 percent in the first quarter, the poorest performance in a year. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> signaled last week that it had begun lowering interest rates slightly amid signs that inflationary pressures are abating somewhat. That move is expected to revive the fortunes of interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing. The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, at an annual level of $ 4.077 trillion in the first quarter. The latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION> newsletter put the consensus growth forecast this year at 2.7 percent, down significantly from GNP growth of 3.9 percent in 1988, the best performance in four years. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which needs significant growth to lower the budget deficit without the need to resort to a tax increase, is more optimistically forecasting growth this year of 3.2 percent. That estimate will be revised by mid-July and administration officials have indicated that they expect to lower their growth figure somewhat.

<HEAD>Proposals Sought to Search for Water on Moon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A private space research organization said Thursday it has asked for proposals from satellite manufacturers to build a probe to look for water on parts of the moon that have never seen daylight. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Maryniak </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the probe can be built for $ 5 million, and sent to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> in 1992 with a little bit f help from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. For example, he told a news conference, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has in storage an Apollo-era gamma ray spectrometer that could be dusted off and used to map the moon's surface and search for water at the poles, areas of which never face the sun. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> or rocket-launching firms could also carry the probe into orbit as non-paying cargo, either on the space shuttle or as a hitchhiker on a rocket taking a satellite to an orbit 22,300 miles above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maryniak </PERSON> said. He said SSI, a 12-year-old organization supported by 4,000 private members, is looking for financing from aerospace corporations and organizations. The six teams of astronauts who visited the moon in the 1969-1972 period all landed closer to the equator of the moon than to the poles and the question of whether there is water to be found in the shadowed area never was answered. Finding water, which is composed of hydrogen and oxygen _ the fuel for chemical rockets _ would be of enormous value to future space exploration. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Space recommended such a search as its first priority. It takes less than one-twentieth the energy to lift materials form the moon as it does from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>.

Listed are bank accounts allegedly controlled by the Marcoses and their associates in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the Times said. The new filings also list dummy firms allegedly used to launder money, along with others that allegedly diverted millions of dollars in Philippine government proceeds from sugar, coconut and other commodity sales. The <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> is holding millions of dollars in jewelry and Filipino pesos, and five handguns that the Marcoses are trying to recover. A federal court case on that matter is pending. The lawsuit by the government of President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is one of 40 cases pending against the Marcoses in this country and in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Besides the Marcoses, the nine defendants in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> case include Saudi Arabian millionaire <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON> who lives in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedicto </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> associate who is a federal fugitive from criminal charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stemming from many of the same allegations outlined in this suit. Other defendants are the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which were allegedly controlled by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates; and three companies, <ORGANIZATION> Krodos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> N.V. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Djebel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON>, chief administrative officer of <ORGANIZATION> Redwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said he had not been served with papers in the case and therefore would not comment. Among other things, the documents accuse the Marcoses of embezzling <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> assets and taking kickbacks from companies doing business in that country. One item states that from July 1965 to February 1986 the <ORGANIZATION> Marcoses </ORGANIZATION> received $ 53 million in kickbacks on government contracts negotiated with seven Japanese citizens as part of a war reparations treaty, the Times said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday made it easier for communities to turn down the volume at rock concerts, a decision free-speech advocates found disquieting. The court, by a 6-3 vote, upheld <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s effort to avoid ear-splitting noise levels in Central Park by requiring sponsors of rock concerts to use a sound system operated by a city-designated engineer. Such requirements do n't violate the freedom-of-expression guarantees of the Constitution's First Amendment, the court said. But <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Beal </PERSON>, political coordinator for a concert-sponsoring organization called Rock Against Racism, said the ruling strikes at the heart of rock. `` Bit by bit, each municipality in the country will be able to turn rock' n' roll into easy listening music,'' <PERSON> Beal </PERSON> said. The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling that would have forced city officials to devise a less restrictive way to deal with what they deem excessively loud entertainment. `` This less-restrictive-alternative analysis has never been a part of the inquiry into the validity of a time, place and manner regulation'' on expression, Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> wrote for the court. `` The city's sound amplification guideline is narrowly tailored to serve ... substantial and content-neutral governmental interests,'' he wrote `` Accordingly, it is valid under the First Amendment as a reasonable regulation of the place and manner of expression.'' In a dissenting opinion, Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the court `` plays to our shared impatience with loud noise to obscure the damage that it does to our First Amendment rights.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> called <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s requirement for a city-run sound system `` an impermissible prior restraint,'' and said such government actions should be subjected to the same scrutiny as regulations based on an expression's content. `` Judgments that sounds are too loud, noise-like or discordant can mask disapproval of the music itself,'' he said. Quoting one music critic, the 80-year-old <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said, `` New music always sounds loud to old ears.'' He was joined in dissent by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. The city's noise-control campaign is aimed at protecting visitors to Central Park's Sheep Meadow, a 13-acre area decreed a `` quiet zone'' by Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> in 1985, and residents of fashionable Central Park West. The city policy was challenged by Rock Against Racism, which sponsors an annual program of speakers and musical groups in the park's <ORGANIZATION> Naumberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acoustic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bandshell </ORGANIZATION>. The losing lawyer in the case was <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, who a day earlier found himself on the winning side when the justices ruled that burning the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag is a form of constitutionally protected political protest. `` What the court gives with one hand it takes away with the other,'' <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON> said. `` Now, art is subject to government control, something the framers of the Constitution certainly would not have countenanced.''

 Baseball Commissioner <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON> <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> has `` substantial and heavily corroborated evidence'' that <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> bet on his own team's games, a lawyer for major league baseball told a judge today. The statement by <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoynes </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was baseball's first assertion that it has evidence that could get the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager banned from baseball for life. The Associated Press has learned the evidence includes an expert's determination that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s handwriting is on betting slips involving <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> games. In addition, a federal law enforcement official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s fingerprints are on the slips. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers today asked Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> for a temporary restraining order blocking <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>'s hearing Monday with <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to consider the gambling allegations. The lawyers charge that <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON> is biased. `` There is evidence, substantial and heavily corroborated evidence, that Mr. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> bet large sums of money on major league baseball games and on games of the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Hoynes </PERSON> said in arguing against the request. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, who did not attend the hearing, has consistently denied betting on baseball. One of his lawyers, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stachler </PERSON>, argued today that <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> had been denied a fair investigation by <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hoynes </PERSON> today asked <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> to release to the public a 225-page report by baseball investigator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> on the allegations. <PERSON> Nadel </PERSON> refused. <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON>'s report includes three `` <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> Betting Sheets'' supplied to investigators by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON>, who claimed to have run bets for <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> to bookmaker <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> later became an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> informant. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers revealed the sheets' existence Monday in their lawsuit and released correspondence that confirms <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> supplied writing samples at baseball's request. The lawsuit said nothing about the analyst's conclusions. <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON>, who last week completed a six-month sentence in a halfway house for failing to report income from the sale of steroids, gave the betting sheets to federal authorities while he was investigated, a source said. He kept a copy, and later supplied that to baseball's investigators when they started looking into <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s alleged gambling, the source said `` Rose is claiming the sheets are forgeries,'' a federal law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Times. `` He says he did n't write them, but we're as confident as we could be that he did.'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, speaking Wednesday night after the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> lost a doubleheader to the <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, was informed of the reports on the handwriting and fingerprints. `` That's not true,'' he said before declining to comment further. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> also is being investigated by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that is examining his taxes. <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s five lawyers, declined to comment when asked about the betting slips. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Giamatti </PERSON>, also declined to comment. In the suit, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s lawyers allege that <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> stole three pieces of paper from the home of the <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> manager. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitcairn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, another Rose lawyer, suggested in a May 12 letter to <PERSON> Dowd </PERSON> that <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> might have forged the sheets. `` <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> is quite clever and has access to Mr. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>'s signature,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pitcairn </ORGANIZATION> wrote `` In fact, we understand that Mr. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> has signed blank pieces of paper for <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> to use in connection with certificates of authenticity for various items. <PERSON> Janszen </PERSON> is not above transposing writing from one sheet to another or creating documents that would appear authentic.''

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> executed seven more people Thursday for attacking soldiers who crushed the pro-democracy movement, and it charged 13 others with spying for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and helping the student protesters. The executions continued despite mounting international condemnation of the government's crackdown on internal dissent. The seven put to death by the state had been convicted of burning military vehicles when the army marched into <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4 and drove thousands of demonstrators out of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. A poster board outside the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> high court was filled with small arrest notices, and those involving the condemned said they ranged in age from 18 to 33. There was a large red check, indicating execution, on each of the notices with the word `` proclaimed.'' Soldiers later tore the notices off the board. So far, 27 people have been put to death: the seven in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, and on Wednesday three in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> and 17 in <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> residents were condemned of leading an angry mob that burned a train on June 6 after it smashed through a barricade set up by protesters, killing six people. The 17 in the northeastern city of <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION> were among 45 people convicted at a public rally of 10,000 of `` seriously endangering public order.'' A local reporter said they were common criminals not associated with the student movement, but a radio broadcast said they had taken part in disturbances in <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province. <LOCATION> Jinan </LOCATION>, like many other Chinese cities, was rocked by demonstrations and riots after the military crackdown ended seven weeks of protests in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Police since have arrested more than 1,600 nationwide for participating in what the government calls the `` counterrevolutionary rebellion.'' Many nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, appealed to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for clemency for the condemned, and denounced the executions when the government carried them out. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Jinhua </PERSON> said Thursday it was `` unwise and futile'' for other countries to try to dictate how <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should handle its domestic turmoil. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> hopes to maintain relations with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stats </ORGANIZATION>, but `` we firmly oppose the American government interfering in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs and exerting pressure on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said at a weekly press briefing The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has cut off military sales and top-level contacts to protest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s suppression of the pro-democracy movement. In announcing the arrests of the 13 people charged with spying for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, national television news showed secretly filmed scenes of the accused mixing with demonstrators and joining in chants during rallies in Tiananmen Square. It also showed secret codes and invisible ink allegedly used by the men, all Chinese citizens. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has maintained that the student protesters were manipulated by outside forces. News reports said the 13 were recruited by military intelligence officers of the Nationalist government on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and by local agents. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> as saying that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> ordered the alleged spies to `` exploit the so-called ` democratic movement,' escalate it into an overall ` anti-Communist' movement and collect information for the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> secret service.'' National television also gave prominent coverage to a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Tieying </PERSON> and a delegation from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> has been mentioned frequently in recent news reports, bolstering theories he is rising in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s political hierarchy and may be headed for a position on the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Party officials are expected to meet soon and two moderates on the five-member committee, party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> and party propaganda chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, are expected to be officially ousted from their posts. <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>, the committee member responsible for security matters, is expected to succeed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> as party boss. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> is a candidate to fill <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s position. The moderates reportedly were stripped of their authority after losing a power struggle to senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and other political hard-liners who backed the crackdown on the democracy movement. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has not been seen since May 19, when he met with protesting students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and expressed sympathy for their demands, including an end to official corruption and a free press. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> imposed martial law on the city the next day.

 One of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>'s more colorful township names will soon disappear from the atlas, thanks to new legislation. Misery <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, on the shore of <LOCATION> Moosehead </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, was created in the early 1800s by mistake, according to legend. Two sets of township boundary lines established by separate surveying teams inadvertently left a sliver of land in between. What remained was a 17-mile-long, string bean-shaped tract _ only a half-mile wide at its widest point _ that became known as Misery Gore. It's not clear how the Misery part of the name came about, but gores are small, uusually triangular pieces of land. The legislation, signed by Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKernan </PERSON>, corrects the surveying error and gives pieces of the area to adjoining unorganized townships, a designation for roughly half of rural <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. The bill also frees <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns most of the land in Misery <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, from having to maintain two sets of property lines. <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> is not left without its gores, however.

Many carried with them a new attitude about this southern state. `` I'm leaving with an improved image of <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, 65, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This state has made strides forward although it looks like there's still a ways to go.'' <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> was among 470 pilgrims who arrived in a caravan of 13 buses from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, to attend ceremonies Wednesday in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, honoring three civil rights workers who were slain 25 years ago. More than 1,000 people went to a church once burned by the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION> to hear veteran civil rights activists and state officials pay tribute to the work of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> during a commemoration of their deaths on June 21, 1964. On Thursday, 10 chartered buses left <ORGANIZATION> Meridian </ORGANIZATION> en route to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and additional ceremonies. The caravan, modeled on the North-to-South Freedom Rides of the 1960s, will end in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> later in the week. Several of those boarding the buses described thier trip as a learning experience and several agreed with <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> that improvements had occurred in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in the years since the killings. Secretary of State <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> native who was 14 at the time of the slayings, said the ceremony `` was good for Mississippians and for people acorss this country. `` We were able to send the message out very clearly that a new day has dawned here in our state and at the same time we had the opportunity to acknowledge a dark corner of our past, said <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON>, who offered an apology in remarks to Wednesday's ceremony. `` Obviously, things are n't perfect in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> but because of the turmoil of our past, there is a special racial sensitivity and we hope that sensitivity can serve as a beacon for the rest of the nation,'' <PERSON> Molpus </PERSON> said. `` We deeply regret what happened here 25 years ago,'' he said. `` We wish we could undo it. Every decent person in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> feels that way.'' The observance, in front of the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Methodist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Church </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> had been conducting a black voter registration meeting the night they were killed, showed that `` <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are far different places than they were 25 years ago,'' Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON> said. After leaving the church, the three men were arrested on a traffic violation and taken to the <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 60 miles northeast of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. They disappeared after being released and an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation concluded they were shot to death by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. Their bodies were found 44 days later buried in an earthen dam. <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, 24, and <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON>, 20, were white volunteers from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> was a 21-year-old black man from <LOCATION> Meridian </LOCATION>.

 The only son of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> wants a role in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s hierarchy following his father's death but is not sure what to aim for, <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday The report, quoting <PERSON> Hojatoleslam </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ansari </PERSON>, indicates <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> wo n't run in presidential elections scheduled July 28. `` When we have been with him -LRB- <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> -RRB- we have never heard a word which would indicate his participation or his aim of participating in political issues,'' <PERSON> Ansari </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION>, which was monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ansari </PERSON> is a leading radical clergyman working at the ayatollah's office and a close friend of <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> The younger <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> allied himself with radicals when his father unleashed a resurgence of fundamentalism in February, calling on Moslems to kill British writer <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel `` The Satanic Verses.'' `` I think that society expects a person who has been trained at the side of the imam ... like him -LRB- <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> -RRB- to be always on the stage in the path of the advancement of the imam's aspirations, and this is also what he intends to do,'' <PERSON> Ansari </PERSON> said. However, he stressed, `` no firm decision has been taken by him.'' Iranians called the revolutionary patriarch who died of a heart attack June 3 their imam, or supreme leader. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> was 86 years old. Several officials had predicted the younger <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, who was his father's closest adviser, would exploit the wave of emotion engulfing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s death to advance his political ambitions. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Zahra </PERSON> <PERSON> Mustafavi </PERSON>, said in a recent interview that <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> had aspired to become president since 1981, but that her father always insisted on keeping his children out of politics. She said she expected <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> to run for presidency this year. But he still had not declared any plan six days before the consitutional period for announcing candidacy ends June 28. The powerful Parliament speaker, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasfsanjani </PERSON>, is the only candidate for the post. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who also is acting commander in chief of the armed forces, leads the so-called pragmatists who advocate a more open policy toward the West and an end to the isolation imposed since <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s 1979 Islamic revolution. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, 55, is allied with <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s president since 1981 who can not run for re-election when his second term expires next month.

 City Councilor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> likes to quote the late Supreme Court Justice <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> as he fights a recall campaign that began when he successfully sponsored an anti-smoking ordinance. `` He said, ` Your right to throw a punch stops where my nose begins,''' said <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>. `` I think that's very apropos for the smoking issue.'' Elected to the council from a heavily <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> district two years ago, Democrat <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> has angered pro-smoking groups so much that they are seeking his removal in an election Tuesday. The ordinance that he sponsored was passed last fall by an 8-1 vote and took effect April 19. Similar laws are in effect in more than 300 cities. For now, violators are simply receiving a warning, but beginning July 19 they will face up to a $ 100 fine for each offense. Smokers Rights of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> contends the council violated the civil rights of thousands of tobacco users by prohibiting smoking in such places as offices, art galleries, shopping malls, libraries, theaters, bingo parlors, taxis and buses. `` It's an overregulation of government and discriminatory because it segregates the smokers from non-smokers,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>, one of the recall backers. `` It is making a criminal act out of a legal act.'' If the recall is successful, said <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>, supporters hope it will be a message to the council to reconsider the ordinance. The group had no plans to seek removal of other council members, she said. `` We feel the person who wrote it is the one we should go after,'' said <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>, 66, who by her estimation averages a pack of cigarettes a day. Only the 20,000 registered voters in <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s northeast <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> district are eligible to vote. For the recall proposal to pass, it must get not only a majority of the votes cast Tuesday but also more than half the number of votes cast in the 1987 city council election. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said his campaign against the recall has received more than $ 5,600 in contributions, and he he expects the tobacco industry to make at least a token contribution to the other side. `` This is a landmark situation for them and if they were successful in the recall, then they'd have something going,'' he said. `` I'd be very surprised if they do n't do a computerized mailing to smokers.'' `` They are not involved,'' countered <PERSON> Jameson </PERSON>. `` It's just a bunch of people beginning to stick up for their rights.'' She and other recall supporters go so far as comparisons to events in the early days of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION>' rise to power. `` A friend of mine was raised in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during the war, and she said it started out on a very low key,'' said <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, also of Smokers Rights of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` One by one, their rights were taken away. It's like a mouse eating away at a mound of cheese. A bite at a time, and pretty soon the whole cheese is gone.'' On the other side, a letter to the editor from <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> McMurray </PERSON> said, `` Until smokers become responsible for their actions, someone has to make reasonable and responsible choices for all citizens.'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said he was not surprised by the furor created by the ordinance. But he said the council was merely adopting a policy that many of the larger private companies and the city's school system already had in place. He said that he had never heard of another official facing a recall election because of an anti-smoking ordinance. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> also cited a study done last year for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lung </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that showed a far greated number of people than previously estimated, up to 46,000 a year, die from passive smoking _ inhaling the smoke from cigarettes of other people. `` We're talking large numbers of people that if they were to go to one place and die at the same time, it would be a national disaster,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` But they all go to their individual hospitals and homes and die an agonizing, slow and private death that just does n't show up.'' Only about 15 percent of the registered voters in the district _ 3,885 _ voted in the city election two years ago. Both <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> and his opponents expect a light turnout again Tuesday, although he endured 100-degree temperatures this week in a door-to-door campaign. `` I'm taking it absolutely serious,'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said. `` A recall has never happened in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, and when people hear the word they assume you have done something illegal or immoral. My job is to convince them that I have n't.''

 Four leaders of an athletics camp for ghetto children were sentenced to the maximum 20 years in prison today for beating to death an 8-year-old girl as other youngsters were forced to count the blows. Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> sentenced the four after rejecting a plea from the victim's father and founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, to `` release these people until such time as an appeal comes.''

Prosecutors said most of the camp's 53 children ranging from 6 weeks to 16 years were forced to watch Oct. 13 as the girl was hit hundreds of times for stealing food from another child at their farmhouse about 30 miles from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Several children testified that <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> was slammed against a wall, kicked, tripped, slapped, dropped on the floor, shoved, bitten, spit upon and hung out a window. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, 35, who said he formed Ecclesia in the <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> area of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to steer children away from crime and drugs and make them Olympic-caliber athletes, was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at the time of his daughter's death. He previously has denied that the children were beaten or abused, saying they were only spanked. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> also was sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of beating five other Ecclesia children with a braided electrical cord. Witnesses testified that <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> did most of the beating, while <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON> held the girl down. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was accused of striking and biting the child.

<HEAD>Judge: Yahwehs Must Pay Tenants Hurt By `Terrorist' Eviction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A federal judge has ordered the Yahweh sect to pay $ 940,000 to tenants who lost their homes in a strong-arm eviction that ended in the deaths of two residents at a crime-ridden apartment complex. The tenants' attorney called Thursday for a police investigation of the sect, saying the civil trial testimony demonstrated that the white-robed <PERSON> Yahwehs </PERSON> engaged in a policy of violence against those who opposed them. `` They fire-bombed an entire block in <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, and they were involved in slayings in other cities,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Equels </PERSON> said. `` I think the state and federal government need to carefully examine the judge's findings here.'' In <LOCATION> Delray </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, after some residents took offense at the Yahwehs' door-to-door proseletyzing, someone threw firebombs into apartments. No one was injured and the crime is unsolved. Witnesses also mentioned slayings, including the unsolved killing of a former sect member. The Yahwehs' attorney, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, said he would appeal the ruling, saying the sect should not be blamed for what a few members did. `` We're appealing as a matter of religious freedom,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. `` If a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> commits a crime, you do n't punish the pope or the priests because of his wrongdoing.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kehoe </PERSON> issued his decision Wednesday in the lawsuit filed by 27 former residents of an <LOCATION> Opa-locka </LOCATION> apartment complex against the Temple of Love, the Miami-based mother church run by the sect's leader <PERSON> Yahweh </PERSON> <PERSON> ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahweh </PERSON>. The church, which takes a strong stand against drugs, moved to buy the apartments in 1986 after the previous owner abandoned them, saying crack dealers and criminals had taken over the complex. `` They will go into a distressed area that is overrun by drug dealers and criminal element and they will clean them up, kick out all the wrong-doers, and then either sell or make housing available for poor people,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. The Yahwehs, who teach that blacks are the true chosen people of God, run businesses and property in predominantly black neighborhoods. The Opa-locka apartment building was eventually abandoned and now is empty. In the Opa-locka case, the Yahwehs, many carrying six-foot wooden staffs, evicted everyone in the complex, threatening residents and dumping their belongings on the street, according to the lawsuit, which called the tactics a `` terrorist occupation strategy.'' On Oct. 30, 1986, two tenants who publicly opposed the evictions were shot and killed. Sect member <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rozier </PERSON> was later convicted of murder in the case, and testified in the tenants' lawsuit. He said <PERSON> Yahweh </PERSON> <PERSON> ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Yahweh </PERSON> had tortured sect members and taught them ritual murder techniques, but other witnesses disputed his account. He also recounted acts of violence allegedly committed by the sect in other communities. The judge did not rule on who was responsible for the deaths of the two tenants, citing conflicting testimony. But he found that the church had engaged in running a criminal enterprise, extortion and assault, and ordered it to pay $ 10,000 to each tenant for emotional distrress, as well as reimburse them for six times the value of the belongings they lost. An additional $ 500,000 in punitive damages also will be divided among the tenants. Former tenant <PERSON> Shadell </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, brother-in-law of one of those killed, said he was pleased by the verdict, recalling his initial sense of helplessness. `` I gave up. I said that there was n't any justice, that nothing would be done about it, because there were so many things they got away with before,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Rock Shift Moves Solstice Phenomenon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHACO CANYON, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Natural erosion apparently has blunted a spike of light dubbed the `` sun dagger'' that ancient pueblo Indians are believed to have used to mark the summer solstice. The dagger was formed by light shining between 9-foot-tall sandstone slabs sitting just below the top of the 500-foot-tall <PERSON> Fajada </PERSON> <PERSON> Butte </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chaco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> in northwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. On the solstice, the longest day of the year, the light would shine on a spiral-shaped petroglyph etched on rock behind the slabs. But erosion apparently caused a rock to shift, and on Wednesday the dagger-shaped pattern of light missed its summer-solstice mark on the petroglyph for perhaps the first time in 1,000 years, researchers said. Instead, the light shined above and to the left of the Indian pattern. `` We're used to this thing acting like a clock,'' physicist <PERSON> Rolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said Wednesday. The dagger widened and lengthened into `` an overgrown carrot,'' said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON>, an artist and archaeo-astronomer who discovered the dagger in 1977 in Chaco Culture National Historical Park, which contains numerous ancient stone dwellings. The rock formation also cast distinctive light patterns at the winter solstice and the fall and spring equinoxes _ when day and night are of equal length. The petroglyph near the canyon's south entrance was believed to have been carved between A.D. 950 and 1150, at the peak of the Anasazi culture that once thrived in Chaco Canyon. <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> and others contend rocks originally might have been manipulated to cause the sunlight patterns. But on Sunday, a group that included <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> discovered that one of the rock slabs had shifted and had altered the phenomenon. `` It's very serious and sad,'' Ms. <PERSON> Sofaer </PERSON> said. `` We knew when we first saw the site that it had a fragility that was remarkable.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zelik </PERSON>, a physics and astronomy professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION>, said the alteration raises questions about how much or how often rocks have moved previously at the site and about just how old it really is. However, <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON> said it's clear the rocks have not moved much, if at all, over the years. He said the erosion which caused the rock to slip might be due to 10 years of relatively wet weather at <LOCATION> Chaco </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> said Thursday that 250,000 ethnic Turks have applied to emigrate to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and 150,000 already have their passports for an exodus from the communist country. Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganev </PERSON>, giving the figures at a news conference, said about 50,000 `` Bulgarian Moslems'' have crossed the border into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in the past month. In keeping with Bulgarian practice, he refused to speak of ethnic Turks. The estimated 1 million ethnic Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, about one-ninth of the country's population, have been forced to adopt Bulgarian names since 1984 and had their language and religious rites banned. In <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> officials said Thursday nearly 55,000 people have crossed into <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> since last month, when police used clubs and dogs to break up demonstrations by the ethnic Turks. Officials said seven people were killed, but Western diplomats say up to 30 died. Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said up to 5,000 Turks, many of whom openly protesting ethnic and religious discrimination, have been expelled since then. The mass voluntary emigration began May 29, when President <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> said any Bulgarian citizen could leave the country. <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> clearly alluded to Bulgarian Turks, who have been receiving passports under a new law that was passed in Parliament in May. An official in <LOCATION> Haskovo </LOCATION>, a town in southeastern <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that his office has issued up to 2,000 passports a day since June 4. Thousands of ethnic Turks, many of them farmers and construction workers, were observed this week on their way out of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> with every piece of property they could take. Government officials at the news conference indicated the labor drain is already disrupting agriculture and many industries. <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Angelov </PERSON>, a government adviser, said those departing had withdrawn up to $ 260 million from banks, adding the sum might reach $ 1 billion if people keep leaving. To cope with the sudden loss of manpower, <PERSON> Ganev </PERSON> said the the government will order longer working hours, relocate workers, reschedule summer vacations and start a crash retraining program. In addition, manpower is to be moved from `` not critical'' to `` critical'' industries or areas, <PERSON> Ganev </PERSON> told the news conference without elaborating. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has been short of labor even before the current wave of emigration, and at least 30,000 Vietnamese are employed in Bulgarian factories. Throughout the news conference, <PERSON> Ganev </PERSON> and five other senior government officials blamed the huge outflow of Turks on Turkish propaganda and `` instigation.'' `` <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has whipped up a psychosis among the Moslem population,'' <PERSON> Ganev </PERSON> said, accusing Turkish Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Oezal </PERSON> of repeatedly issuing military threats against <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Slavs </PERSON> and ethnic Turks have been deeply suspicious of one another since the five-century rule of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s Ottoman Empire Asked if <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> would accept the assistance of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, he said, `` We have no refugees, so we do not need him.''

 Twelve Roman Catholic priests say they and their parishioners will defy orders by Cardinal <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> to close their churches by June 30. More than 200 Roman Catholics at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanislaus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> applauded Wednesday's action by the priests, who said they would continue to celebrate Masses beyond the closing date. `` Take a look at these guys and remember their faces,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, one of the 12 priests. `` Their median age is 50 so they can only do it for the next 35 years.'' Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said priests holding services past the deadline would be in violation of church policy. `` When a bishop establishes a parish, it's established _ when he closes it, it's closed,'' <PERSON> Berman </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't go out and erect -LRB- a church -RRB- without a bishop establishing a canonical decree, no matter what Father wants to do.'' Priests and parishioners also said they would begin a three-day fast Sunday in hopes of influencing a civil court decision expected Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hathaway </ORGANIZATION> will rule on a request for a temporary restraining order to stop the closings until all appeals made through the church have been exhausted.

They also have appealed to church leaders in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Szoka </PERSON> ordered 30 churches closed or merged with others, citing money problems, little active participation by parishioners and a priest shortage.

 About 30 Girl Scouts suffered minor burns when a malfunctioning pump on a water theme park slide released too much muriatic acid, authorities said. The girls' injuries ranged from skin irritation to blistering, according to officials at <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where the girls were examined and treated. Seven required treatment for skin burns or eye irritation. More than 100 Brownie Girl Scouts, ages 7 to 9, went to the <LOCATION> Waupaca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Waterthrills </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> on Wednesday as part of daylong outing. `` The girls started complaining immediately when they got out of the water,'' said <PERSON> Brownie </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. `` Some of the girls only went down the water slide once and complained that they were starting to burn and itch.'' Water park officials said the problem was traced to a malfunctioning pump that releases acid to maintain a neutral pH level for the water. The pump was fixed.

 A deep-sea inspection of the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> suggests that the most powerful battleship in <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the British in a celebrated battle, underwater explorer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said Thursday. During a 90-minute news conference, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> described how he his ocean-crawling robot located the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> `` sitting upright and proud'' two weeks ago. Then the American oceanographer, whose father was of British background and whose mother was of <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> heritage, addressed himself to the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people in German. `` I am an underwater explorer, not a treasure hunter,'' he said, translating himself back into English. `` We found no human remains. We touched nothing and took nothing. ... The future of the <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION> is in the hands of the German people.'' He said he will disclose its exact location only to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> so Germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship, which sank after a battle May 27, 1941. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, a senior scientist at the <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire. `` Only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece,'' <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said. `` It appears the crew opened it up along its entire length. It was clearly flooded, stem to stern.'' `` Maybe the Germans did n't want it taken as a war prize,'' he added. It is known that two years earlier, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> ordered the German pocket battleship <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> <PERSON> Spee </PERSON> scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of <LOCATION> Montevideo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, and attacked by British ships. <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> apparently wanted to keep the British from learning the secrets of the <PERSON> Graf </PERSON> <PERSON> Spee </PERSON>'s construction and weapons. In the 1941 battle, the Bismarck's main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her secondary guns, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said, so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable. Rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabric-covered British biplanes, it was unable to escape. Asked if the German commander could n't have surrendered by ceasing fire, <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said `` in the fuzz of battle'' in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the Germans were giving up. Again, he speculated, perhaps the Germans did not want the ship's technologically advanced equipment to fall into British hands The Bismarck was found by <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> in more than 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of <LOCATION> Brest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He said it was in remarkably good shape, `` elegant, well preserved.'' Before the battle, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ringing three-word command: `` Sink the Bismarck!'' Of the Bismarck's 2,200-man crew, only about 115 survived. British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might have been a German U-boat. German vessels later rescued only five more survivors. The story has been recounted in books, songs and a movie. The sinking occurred only eight days after the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, for her first operation. If unstopped, it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut British morale at a time when <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power. The British sent the warship Hood after the Bismarck but within five days of going to sea the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> had sunk the Hood in a three-minute engagement, with the loss of all but three of the vessel's crew of 1,419. The Hood was a symbol of British sea power, and its loss stunned the British public and the war government and made sinking the Bismarck a mission of crucial importance. <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> said under laws of the sea, the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> remains the property of the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people. The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same remote-controlled robot that <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON> used four years ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg.

 Seven <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> women filed a $ 100 million lawsuit Thursday against <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest insurance firms, alleging its hiring practices for years have discriminated against women and minorities Their class-action lawsuit accuses State Farm of reserving for white men the jobs of sales agents, claims adjusters and underwriters. `` This is a very valuable job and is a job that historically was passed on by nepotism and cronyism in what generally is described as a good old boys network,'' said <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Saperstein </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, attorney who won a similar lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> in that state last year. `` This case is like that case. It's brought on behalf of all women. And we think it's representative of what happened to women in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. There were a lot of tactics used to discourage women,'' he said. He alleged women were told they would need a large investment to become an agent, that night work could be dangerous and that the long hours could disrupt their family life. `` None of those statements is true,'' he said. `` What's amazing about the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case is meeting these women and how it took me back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Their stories are almost identical to what I heard in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case stems from complaints filed by the women in 1980 with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahly </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, said he knew little of the lawsuit but insisted the company had been cooperating with the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION>. `` In fact, all along the way we've asked the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> to identify those individuals who believed they had been discriminated against to correct any injustices there may have been, but the <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> has not provided us with the names,'' he said. He said the company's 895 agents in its <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> region included 126 women and 125 minorities. Plaintiff <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Grube </PERSON> of <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> said she applied for a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> job in 1982 after working as a secretary for a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> agent but was told she did not have a college degree and did not fulfill a minimum net worth requirement. She now works for <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and described herself as an award-winning agent who has generated more business than any other female agent in the company. `` I want other people who come in to get opportunities that were ripped away from us,'' said plaintiff <PERSON> Vel </PERSON> <PERSON> Yvette </PERSON> <PERSON> Payad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Payad </PERSON> said she was offered a job as State Farm agent in 1980 and accepted it only to be told a few days later that she was rejected. She applied again in 1988 and was rejected. She now works for another insurance company. In the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> case, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> agreed to name women to half its sales agents jobs and pay millions of dollars to women who contended they were discriminated against from 1974 to 1987. That lawsuit accused State Farm of refusing to recruit women on the same basis as men for agent jobs and discouraging women from applying for the lucrative jobs. According to the lawsuit, although 80 percent of all State Farm employees in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were women, 98 percent of the agents were men.

 A chronology compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Geographic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of the fate of the German World War II battleship Bismarck: 1936 _ Construction starts in <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> of the 820-foot ship with a displacement, when fully loated, of more than 50,000 tons, carrying eight 15-inch guns, 12 5.9-inch guns and 16 4.1-inch guns and a crew of 2,200 and capable of a top speed of 30 knots. Feb. 14, 1939 _ On St. Valentine's Day, <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> launches the ship. May 19, 1941 _ After more than two years in fitting and shakedown cruises, the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> sets sail from <LOCATION> Gdynia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with orders to sink Allied merchant ships in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> while evading engagement with allied warships. May 20, 1941 _ A Swedish cruiser spots the Bismarck and its escort, the <PERSON> Prinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugen </PERSON>, off the coast of neutral <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Later they are sighted off the coast of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>. May 21, 1941 _ British Spitfires over the <LOCATION> Bergen-Korsfjord </LOCATION> region of <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> spot the two German ships. The British send the battle cruiser Hood to join other British ships on patrol in the <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. May 22, 1941 _ More British forces head for the search zone. May 23, 1941 _ In the <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> beteen <LOCATION> Greenland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, the British cruisers <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> sight the German ship threading through a minefield. The Bismarck opens fire, but the British retire safely. The British follow the Germans despite rain and snow storms and dangerous ice floes. The Hood and the Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> are closing in from about 250 miles away. May 24 _ At 5:35 a.m., the Hood and Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> sight the Bismarck and open fire. The Germans return fire. At 6:01 a.m., a massive explosion sinks the Hood, leaving only three of its 1,419 crewmen alive. The <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> suffers a ruptured fuel tank. The Bismarck engages the British again in the evening. The <PERSON> Prinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugen </PERSON> escapes. The Bismarck's commander decides to make for a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> port for repairs. A British force heads to the area from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. Around midnight, nine British biplanes attack, causing little damage. May 25 _ About 3 a.m., the Bismarck evades its chasers and heads for the safety of U-boat patrols and <ORGANIZATION> Luftwaffe </ORGANIZATION> air cover, near the coast of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. May 26 _ A British plane spots the Bismarck. In a last-ditch effort to stop it before it reaches safety, planes from a British carrier score two torpedo hits that wreck the Bismarck's steering gear and jam her rudders, only hours from safety. The Bismarck's fate is sealed May 27 _ At 8:47 a.m., a British force opens up on the limping <LOCATION> Bismarck </LOCATION>, putting its main guns out of action. By 10 a.m., the <PERSON> Bismarck </PERSON> is a battered hulk. By 10:39 a.m. it has capsized and sunk, coming to rest upright on the ocean floor with only 115 of its crew of 2,200 rescued.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Thursday strengthened its ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, agreeing to exchange delegations of Moslem religious leaders and indicating it would send weaponry to its Islamic neighbor. The agreement with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> came as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> struggles with a resurgence of Islamic fundamentalism and conflicts between its Christians and 50 million Moslems. The agreement was part of a broad declaration signed by President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Iranian Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, whose visit to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has defrosted a decade of icy relations. It implies future Soviet weapons sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, by promising the superpower's cooperation in `` strengthening the defense capacity'' of its southern neighbor. At the same time, the document commits both nations to strive `` to rid the world of aggression.'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> later sidestepped questions about arms deals. He said only that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was trying to be self-sufficient in arms but has some `` technical requirements that we would like to see met by various sources.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would be guided by developments in the country _ and not by its relationship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s major weapons supplier during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, but even then, the Soviets arranged for the sale of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through third countries. During a state dinner Wednesday, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> invited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to visit <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. If <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accepts, he would be the first leader of a major power to visit <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> since the Islamic revolution in 1979. The declaration says both nations `` will strive for a broad acquaintance with each other's life, culture, convictions, customs and traditions.'' It specifically called for the governments to exchange delegations of religious leaders. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been troubled in the past 1 -LCB- years by unrest among its more than 100 ethnic groups, especially the 50 million Moslems on its southern borders. Moslem Azerbaijanis fought with <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Armenians </PERSON>, resulting in more than 90 deaths last year, and in recent weeks 100 people have been killed in the primarily Moslem Central Asian republics in rioting prompted by ethnic and economic problems. An official from one of those republics, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, attributed the violence to a group trying to create a `` pan-Islamic front'' aimed at hysteria and the ouster of the European population. Soviet reports occasionally mention Iranian flags and photographs of <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> being carried by demonstrators. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, asked about the Central Asian clashes at a news conference Thursday, said his country would not interfere with Soviet internal affairs. However, he added, `` we consider Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has a long way to come in providing freedoms and people's participation in the democratic process.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, originally expected to leave Thursday, traveled to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> instead and was reportedly planning to stop in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> on his way home. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has a consulate in the republic's capital, which <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> called `` the Moslem city of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>'' in announcing the changed itinerary. At the news conference, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> emphasized that the talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had gone well. `` The optimism that we had before the meetings has been totally justified,'' <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> said. On other issues, <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>: _ accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of unspecified `` plots and conspiracies'' against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> when asked about the possibility that relations would improve after the death of <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s spiritual leader _ said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s order stands for the killing of <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>, the British author of the novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s judgment was based on Islamic law and `` this is not the kind of prescription that can be reversed. There is no one in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> who could reverse it.'' _ said Afghans must be free to resolve their differences without outside interference after the withdrawal of Soviet soldiers from their country more than four months ago. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> agreed to cooperate in several areas, including atomic energy, space and gas processing. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> suggested a Soviet-Iranian space voyage, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ordered his deputies to begin working out the details. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> emphasized in remarks distributed by <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday that several months before his death on June 3, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> called for better relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> exchanged messages in February, and since then their foreign ministers have met four times.

 Panicked families crowded the airport in a <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> desert town where four people were killed in ethnic violence, official media reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Pravda </ORGANIZATION> said that although the town of Novy Uzen was quiet on Wednesday, its airport `` is packed with families'' trying to flee. Pravda also said the disturbances had spread to settlements about 40 miles away in the <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> republic. About 500 people demonstrated in <LOCATION> Zhetibai </LOCATION> and two people were hurt in <LOCATION> Munaishi </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. It said ethnic Kazakhs in <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> demanded Sunday that all members of <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> ethnic groups be evicted within a week. More than one-third of Novy Uzen's 56,000 residents are from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>. `` The demand was accompanied by threats,'' Pravda said without elaborating. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> called the demand `` anti-constitutional'' and said it could not be met. The violence began Friday during a fight at a dance, and more than 50 police officers and soldiers were injured in rioting over the next four days. Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers were sent to the town and authorites imposed a 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew. Officials on Thursday tightened their control over <ORGANIZATION> Novy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Uzen </ORGANIZATION>'s water, sewer and electrical systems, as well as food stores and a bread factory _ all targets of rioters who want to `` be able to dictate their own conditions to the authorities,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said Ethnic Kazakhs say the Caucasus settlers dominate the oil industry jobs on which the town depends and receive preferential treatment in housing and other benefits. The settlers also have set up private businesses that sell supplies in the isolated desert town for exorbitant prices, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. Corrupt party and government workers in <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> also contributed to widespread discontent by `` getting involved in dirty deals,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted top <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> officials as saying. In Alma <ORGANIZATION> Ata </ORGANIZATION>, the republic's capital, an ethnic Kazakh was named the region's new party chief to replace <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolbin </PERSON>, an ethnic Russian. He left the post to become chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors government ministries, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The appointment of <LOCATION> Kolbin </LOCATION> as party chief in 1986 touched off widespread rioting in Alma Ata that left hundreds injured and at least two dead. The new party chief, <PERSON> Nursultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nazarbayev </PERSON>, has been premier of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> since 1984. The 49-year-old <PERSON> Nazarbayev </PERSON> was the first Soviet official to admit the 1986 unrest was ethnically motivated and not hooliganism as press reports claimed. The former metal worker backs greater economic independence for the republic of more than 16 million, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The unrest in <LOCATION> Novy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Uzen </LOCATION> was the third outbreak of ethnic rioting in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in the past six weeks. In the worst of the violence, native Uzbeks attacked the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> of eastern <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and about 100 people were killed. Most of the victims were <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>, who were forcibly resettled in the valley in 1944 by the late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>. The Fergana region has quieted down, and police there have been detaining people for `` inciting unlawful actions,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday.

<TEXT>
 The new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official for African affairs said Thursday he expects <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> to make `` interesting proposals'' after the September general elections, and hopes blacks will be ready to respond. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, said he will talk to South African government officials and leaders of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during a trip to the region in July. He spoke from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in a special <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> hookup with four South African cities. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> repeatedly mentioned `` the new government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' apparently referring to the fact that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is expected to replace retiring P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as president after September parliamentary elections. They exclude voting by the 28 million black majority. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 41 years, is virtually certain to remain in power. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said he will visit <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, and tell exiled leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s biggest guerrilla organization: `` I'm expecting the new South African government to be coming up with some interesting proposals If the new government proposed a dialogue, will you be ready?'' If <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> lifts a four-year state of emergency, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, `` there has to be a reciprocal element that political activity would be nonviolent.'' He said this `` will be one of the major topics'' when <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, co-president of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, meets President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> next week. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> is prohibited from speaking in public or leaving her home at night without permission. The passport allowing her to visit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the first granted her and is valid for only 30 days. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said a visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> still is `` the subject of diplomatic discussions.'' He gave an overview of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> policy, noting it still is under review. `` You will see probably a more activist role of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on the issue of internal constitutional change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. What we'd like to do is be more active in promoting a dialogue between the government and the black leadership. I think we could be a catalyst.'' He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had concentrated on U.N. Resolution 435 bringing independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ settled by a transition plan now under way. `` The next priority of our policy is trying to promote settlement in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> itself,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` The successful completion of 435 could lead to more peacemaking. <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- where rebels are fighting Marxist governments -RRB- are ready for peacemaking efforts.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> helped develop an African summit to resolve the Angolan civil war that began Thursday in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. `` We may have a breakthrough,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. He also saw a `` greater effort at multilateral diplomacy'' in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ coordinating with former colonizers <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> _ and `` greater cohesion'' in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We welcome <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s new diplomatic effort in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It has changed from a policy of destabilization to one of cooperation,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` Sanctions have had a very major impact on development of new thinking in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he said, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to concentrate on dialogue. `` But you can not even begin that without the release of black leaders and the lifting of the emergency so non-violent political activity can take place. `` If progress on these lines is not made within two years of the new government it would be difficult for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> to hold back forces demanding increased pressure, and it would be difficult for <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as well.''

 A federal judge has rejected a request by former National Security Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> for access to classified documents in the Iran-Contra case. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> must narrow his other requests for material. The ruling follows statements last week by independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> that prosecutors would abandon substantial portions of the indictment against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> is charged with four counts of obstructing and making false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s activities on behalf of the Contras and a November 1985 arms shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> plans to retain portions of the indictment alleging that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> conspired with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and others in the obstructions and false statements. He said he would seek dismissal of theft and wire fraud charges against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> pertaining to the diversion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sale proceeds. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> should `` reformulate and limit his demands,'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said in a four-page order signed Wednesday and made public Thursday. The judge rejected a wide-ranging request for classified documents that <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> filed June 12, four days before <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> announced his intention to reduce the scope of the indictment. An 64-page request for material filed May 15 demanded that the government give <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` all documents created between Dec. 1, 1981, and the present'' referring to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the Contras. <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> also demanded notebooks, diaries and other documents relating to former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON> and former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, as well as all material tending to establish that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directed the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff to ensure that the Contras would be supported during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebels.

 Officials tossed a life preserver Thursday to <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Columbus </PERSON> to mark the beginning of a restoration project of the crumbling monument. `` This sculpture, excellent in its artistry and priceless in its symbolism, is among our city's most important cultural artifacts, and it will be saved,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. He helped attach a plywood life preserver to its base in a ceremony with other city officials and prominent Italian-Americans. Since 1892, the 13-foot-tall <PERSON> Carrara </PERSON> marble statue of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, maps in hand, has gazed down from atop a 26-foot granite column. On the pedestal, a winged figure, now virtually faceless, looks at a globe. The city wants the monument, designed by the Italian sculptor <PERSON> Gaetano </PERSON> <PERSON> Russo </PERSON>, restored for the 500th anniversary in 1992 of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' discovery of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The monument has been corroded by sulfuric acid in the air. The <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> raised the money for the restoration, which is expected to cost $ 275,000.

 People without medical insurance not only are less likely to get into hospitals than insured patients, they also get less treatment once they're there, a new study of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hospital patients has found. But the finding does n't necessarily mean the uninsured get worse care, because doctors may keep insured patients in the hospital longer than necessary and may give them more treatment than they need, researchers said. Previous studies have revealed that the poor, minorities and people without health insurance have less chance of getting medical care than others. But `` there has been a feeling that once you get into the system, everybody is treated the same,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>, a health-policy specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and a co-author of the new study. `` What we're seeing is that even after you get into the hospital, these patterns persist.'' <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, also of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, examined the treatment of more than 65,000 patients at 52 hospitals in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area during 1983. They found that uninsured patients, on average, underwent fewer procedures and were discharged earlier than patients covered by <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The uninsured also were discharged earlier than Medicaid patients, the study said. Though the differences were not great, they should serve as a `` red flag'' to spur further investigation, <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON> said in a telephone interview Thursday. More studies will be necessary to determine if the Boston-area trends reflect those in the rest of the nation, said <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>, who added that <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> is currently working to update the 1983 findings. The study also found that people with different types of medical problems tended to end up at different types of hospitals, with the major teaching hospitals and public hospitals taking the brunt of the tough cases among the uninsured. `` Although we lacked data on income and housing situation, the results are consistent with the popular view of the urban public hospital as the provider of last resort for persons with multiple problems at the bottom of the socioeconomic scale,'' the researchers said. After correcting statistically for differences in severity of illness and other factors, the researchers found that uninsured patients stayed in the hospital half a day less than <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> patients _ 5.36 compared with 5.79 days. The uninsured underwent about 7 percent fewer procedures _ operations or tests _ per stay than <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> patients, 1.16 vs. 1.25, respectively, the researchers said. `` The effects we found occurred in all types of hospitals, including major teaching and public hospitals _ institutions commonly considered to be relatively blind to payment source,'' the researchers reported in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Though the results suggest that hospitals or physicians tailor people's medical care according to ability to pay, or that patients do so themselves to avoid high bills, it does n't necessarily mean the uninsured are getting inferior care, the researchers said. `` We know, for example, that lengths of stay have been decreasing nationwide during the last decade, but so far there is little evidence that the quality of care has been reduced,'' they said. Longer stays and more procedures among insured patients in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> area may represent overuse of medical resources, they said. `` Further research is warranted to clarify whether lower utilization represents inadequate care and whether alternative financial and organization arrangements can remedy the situation,'' the researchers said.

 The crippled Soviet ocean liner Maxim Gorky reached a remote archipelago for repairs Thursday, two days after its bow was ripped open when it hit an iceberg while on a cruise. The ship reached <LOCATION> Coles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Svalbard </LOCATION>, the largest of the <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archipelago </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klyver </PERSON>, an administrative official for the Norwegian islands. The secluded bay has no wharf or facilities but offers shelter from wind and waves, he said. The 630-foot <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> was kept afloat with pumps after a 20-foot gash was ripped in its bow and it took on 18,000 tons of water during a midnight sun cruise in the <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. All of the 575 passengers and 378 crew were rescued. The passengers and some crew were brought to shelter at <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION> and flown home from there. Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanov </PERSON> told the Norwegian news agency <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> the <ORGANIZATION> Maxim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gorky </ORGANIZATION> anchored in the bay with 184 crew aboard. Temporary repairs were being made there to allow the ship to sail to <LOCATION> Bremerhaven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, its port of embarkation. He did not estimate how long repairs would take. Soviet news reports said the ship would be back in service in three weeks. The Soviet newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossiya </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the ship may have rammed a metal object frozen in the ice or that a large old piece of ice unexpectedly surfaced. Norwegian maritime experts said the <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> was sailing too fast for conditions in an area clogged with drifting ice up to 20 feet thick. <PERSON> Sigurn </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON>, commander of the Norwegian coast guard vessel Senja, which rescued passengers, dimissed claims the Soviet crew was drunk during the accident or rescue. A Norwegian doctor aboard the <PERSON> Senja </PERSON> said Wednesday that Soviet sailors were intoxicated. `` There was absolutely no drunkenness on the part of the Soviet crew involved in the rescue,'' <PERSON> Kleiven </PERSON> was quoted as saying in the daily newspaper Aftenposten. He did say, however, that some waiters, service personnel and passengers had been drinking. Some passengers spent seven hours in open boats among the ice floes waiting to be taken to safety and were given alcohol by the crew. `` Drinking alcohol during exposure to cold is a bad combination,'' said <PERSON> Mads </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, the Norwegian doctor.

 A prominent Israeli history professor was stabbed to death in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on Thursday, and police said they were investigating whether the killing was a terrorist attack. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops shot a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> man to death and detained 30 others during a raid on the village of <LOCATION> Silwad </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said. Soldiers also shot and wounded four Palestinian youths in clashes with stone-throwers in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, Arab hospital officials said. The body of <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> was found by schoolchildren in a park near <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> building, police spokesman <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, 64, was stabbed several times in the chest, <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said. He said robbery was ruled out as a motive because a watch and money were found on <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s body. Asked whether investigators believed terrorists were to blame, <PERSON> Sandori </PERSON> said: `` This direction is also being checked.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported police have questioned 70 people, mostly Arabs, and have detained two of the Arabs. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bet </PERSON> secret service was called in to investigate. <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>, a winner of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s top prize for academic excellence, also lectured at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> universities. Jewish academics said he was considered the world's leading expert on the history of the Jews during the Second Temple period, 166 B.C. to A.D. 70, when Jews in the land of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were ruled by Greek and Roman conquerors. During this time, the Jews rebuilt their ancient temple in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> for the second time and established their second independent commonwealth. Professor <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, an associate of <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>'s, said he was a dedicated academician who was `` not involved in anything political.'' He said <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> `` was aware there were some dangers involved walking around <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'' and that his wife was concerned about the park path he often took to work `` because it was out of sight.'' The death of the Arab in <LOCATION> Silwad </LOCATION> raised to 528 the number of Palestinians killed in the 18 -LCB- - month uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Twenty-three Israelis also have died in the violence. The army spokesman's office said 22-year-old <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Raouf </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> was fatally shot `` after he refused to obey an order to stop'' when troops raided the community, 12 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. It was the latest in a series of search-and-arrest missions to capture <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists. The Arabs detained during the raid were suspected of stoning or firebombing cars of Jewish settlers on nearby highways, the army said. Palestinians in nearby villages said Thursday they received unsigned warning notes from settlers threatening retaliatory action against any attacks. `` We are going to be forced to take harsh measures against all those who are behind the disturbances,'' said the fliers, printed in Arabic and strewn on village streets. Jewish settlers have been blamed for a series of attacks on Palestinians in recent weeks. The latest incident occured on Tuesday after the funeral of an American-born Jewish settler, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenfeld </PERSON>, who allegedly was stabbed to death by Palestinians. After the funeral, a settler opened fire with an Uzi submachine gun on Arab laborers on a street near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, wounding two. The settler's name and hometown have been withheld by police. A <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> court extended the settler's detention for 15 days in a closed-door hearing on Thursday. Police said he also was under investigation for organizing other attacks on Arabs, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported. A court convicted a Palestinian man in the stabbing deaths of two elderly Jews on a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> street on May 3. Three others were injured in the attack. The court said <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Razik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaloum </PERSON>, 25, from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> El-Bireh </LOCATION>, confessed to the killings. He is to be sentenced Friday. The prosecutor has asked for two consecutive life terms.

 So many people are obeying a new recycling law that newspapers were piled to the ceiling and trucks had to wait in line to drop trash at the local recycling center. The city finally closed the center. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, the main one in the city, was inundated with newspapers, cans and plastics after the city expanded its mandatory curbside pickup program, which began this spring, from 49,000 households to 97,000 in northwestern <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The response amazed recycling officials, who thought it would take much longer to educate people about the ordinance requiring them to sort recyclables and leave them at curbside. `` Previous experiences led us to expect about 30 percent participation,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recycling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Instead, unofficial surveys place it at close to 90 percent in the new recycling zone. `` We're planners and we try to do a good job of anticipation,'' he said. `` We just were n't ready for that response.'' Neither was the recycling center. Almost within days, the amount of recycled materials received at the plant jumped from 12 tons a day to 35 tons. Newspapers reached the ceiling. Bottles and cans gathered in mounds. A fenced-in area outside the plant, once a parking lot, became a storage area. Lines of recycling trucks waited to drop their cargo. On June 16, the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licenses </ORGANIZATION> and Inspections closed the plant because of dangerous, unhealthy conditions. Since then the backlog has eased, except for newspapers. They are a special problem, because there is a newspaper glut on the recycling market, said <PERSON> Mjenzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Traylor </PERSON>, head of the plant. `` It's costing us $ 15 to $ 17 to bail a ton,'' he said `` And for the most part, we're getting $ 5 or less per ton.'' A recycling center in nearby <LOCATION> Bucks </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> has volunteered to take some of the excess, but <PERSON> Traylor </PERSON> said that is only a temporary solution. The officials plan to meet Monday to discuss ways of alleviating the situation. `` We're in a fortunate position because we have a number of major users of recycled paper here in the community,'' said <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said the problems will not affect plans to expand the mandatory recycling program into the northeastern part of the city July 24. He said the city has contracted with a separate recycling company, <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, to handle the additional 45,000 households. Though the recycling is mandatory, although <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> said his office will not push the issue for the time being. `` We're having problems with 90 percent compliance,'' he said. `` Why would we push to get it to 100 percent?''

<HEAD>Valve Problem Stops Low-Power Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Low-power testing of the reactor at the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant was halted Thursday because of a problem with a steam valve, operators said. The reactor was running at 3 percent of maximum power at the engineers shut it down, said spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON>. `` The valve remained open longer than it should have, drawing too much steam away from the plant's steam generators,'' <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. `` Under our strict operating procedures, control room operators manually shut down the reactor.'' He said the engineers went to work to correct the problem so the reactor could be re-started. He said the valve was on the non-nuclear side of the plant. Hot, pressurized, contaminated water from the reactor flows through a heat exchanger and back to the reactor. On the non-nuclear side, water flows into the heat exchanger, picks up heat from the nuclear side and becomes steam to drive the turbines that spin the plant's generators <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the valve directs steam that normally would drive the plant's turbines back to a steam condenser instead. He said the steam bypasses the turbines during low-power testing. Because it stayed open, more steam condensed to water, thus cooling the system too quickly. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the problem was n't considered serious enough to warrant notifications to state and federal regulatory officials, but <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> observers were in the control room at the time. <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said the valve, one of about 6,000 in the plant, is not associated with three other valves that malfunctioned earlier this month, delaying the start of the tests. `` The reason we do tests is to ensure that all plant systems are working as designed. The low-power testing of the reactor in the past nine days has gone very well, and this is the first interruption we've had in the schedule,'' he said. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials won regulatory permission to conduct the tests despite long opposition from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and anti-nuclear activists who argue nearby beaches and communities could never be safely evacuated in the event of an accident. The plant has not yet won a commercial operating license, but utility officials predict they will be selling <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> power by the end of the year.

<HEAD>U.S.-British Agreement on Developing New Missile for Britain</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has signed an agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help develop a new air-launched nuclear missile, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday. The spokesman, who refused to be identified, said the agreement for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> feasibility study on updating one of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s key strategic weapons _ a sensitive issue with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ was signed Dec. 1 but not announced at the time. Officials acknowledged the agreement after <ORGANIZATION> Jane </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weekly </ORGANIZATION> reported it. It said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> company <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is investigating with <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> the possibility of developing a new tactical air-to-surface missile. The missile with a range of 250-370 miles and fired from Tornado bombers would replace <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s aging WE177 free-fall nuclear bomb. The spokesman said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement did not mean that the British were abandoning a possible deal with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. `` We have not signed a similar memorandum of understanding with the French, but both American and French systems remain open as options for consideration,'' he said. However, the Anglo-French project appeared virtually certain of being abandoned. It involved developing a longer-range version of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ASMP </ORGANIZATION> nuclear air-to-surface missiles. Negotiations began about two years ago, there has been no sign of progress, and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> sources have said in recent months that the French system is unsuitable for British bombers. The strategic importance of air-launched nuclear weapons has increased following the 1987 agreement between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to withdraw all their medium-range, land-based nuclear weapons from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has complained that updating air-launched missiles violates the spirit of the 1987 agreement. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s, an authoritative magazine, said a firm decision on developing with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies a new weapon for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was expected in 1992. `` The plan is likely to attract criticism from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kingdom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and others who consider its development inopportune in the present East-West climate,'' <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said. The magazine said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was competing with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> for the British contract. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has proposed a variation of its Short Range Attack Missile II being developed for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> has signed an agreement to investigate adapting its Supersonic Low-Altitude Target being developed for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s said.

 Trying to find the right McKay can be a wee problem in the Scottish Highlands village of <PERSON> Farr </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> came up with a solution: a separate telephone book for the district, complete with first names. Of the district's 600 residents, there are about 200 McKays or Mackays. `` This is what they call ` Mackay Country,' there are so many of them,'' the former innkeeper said. `` It's amazing how many Mackays are here.'' Previously, <PERSON> Farr </PERSON> and the 12 surrounding villages in its district on mainland <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s most northern coast had to use the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Highlands </LOCATION> and Islands directory, which lists more than 2,000 Mackays, mostly only by first initial.

<HEAD>Administration Criticized on Sanctions for Chemical, Biological Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Senators criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Thursday for failing to advocate harsh sanctions against foreign companies that spread chemical and biological weapons. `` You do n't have a policy position,'' Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., said in response to testimony from <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON>, undersecretary of State for security assistance <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> appeared before the <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s subcommittee on international finance. <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> told the subcommittee the administration would support some sanctions, with the president having the authority to say when they would be used. But he said he opposed sanctions for past actions and said the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would violate international law. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> McEntee </PERSON>, undersecretary of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> for export administration, said power to impose additional sanctions is not needed. Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa, accused the administration of having a double standard, pointing out that the actions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the killing of demonstrators are not based on international law. `` What your are saying is that if a commercial party is involved, they deserve to be treated better than the butchers of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` If that's your position, it's very hard for us to accept it.'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> is co-author with Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Kan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, of a bill that calls for curbing exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from companies that help countries get chemical or biological weapons. He insisted on the need for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to prod the administration to take action on trade matters. `` The record is that when we've taken strong action, we've gotten results,'' <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said. `` When we've done nothing, nothing happened. <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> is one example. `` And I've got to tell you, in my judgment it took the legislative equivalent of half a dozen atomic bombs to wake the -LRB- west -RRB- <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government up on the <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> sale. First time they looked at it, what did they say? ` Huh, it could n't happen here' ... `` Have you got any examples that say keeping this stuff quiet and doing nothing succeeds?'' In the <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> case a subsidiary of the Japanese company sold the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> machines that could have been useful in protecting Soviet submarines from detection by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. A law approved by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> curbed sales in this country by both the subsidiary and the parent company. The Imhausen firm is accused of helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> build a plant to make poison gas. The West German government has acted against the company. `` Senator, you may be right in those specific cases,'' <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> replied. `` But if we here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pass a law which automatically, without discretion, mandates sanctions where the operations of foreign companies are concerned, we are concerned that the reaction of foreign governments will be that it is their business to police their companies. It is their cooperation that we want.'' Sen. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wirth </PERSON>, D-Colo., called the answers the worst he had heard in 15 years of experience in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` I get the impression you do n't feel the sense of urgency all over the country,'' he said. <PERSON> Bartholomew </PERSON> replied that the question was getting at least the priority in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration that it is getting in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Journalists Accuse Military of Violating Press Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Sudanese Journalists' Union on Thursday accused security authorities of violating press freedom by detaining six journalists and shutting down two newspapers, an independent newspaper reported. The daily <ORGANIZATION> Al-Usbua </ORGANIZATION> also reported that one of the detained journalists had relayed an offer from Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> for ousted President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> to end his exile in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and return home as a civilian. <PERSON> Al-Usbua </PERSON> said newspaper editor <PERSON> Sidahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> before traveling to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to interview <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>, and suggested the former military dictator be allowed home. It said <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> agreed, a statement the president denies. In <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> said <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> had relayed a verbal offer from <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> to `` return to <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> and work and talk and criticize the political situation.'' <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> said he had welcomed <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON>'s invitation, but would have preferred it in writing <PERSON> Mahdi </PERSON> denied he granted <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> permission to invite <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> back. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Constituent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s parliament, that he told <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> he would hold the editor responsible if the interview with <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> was against the national interests of the government. The alleged invitation reportedly was delivered several weeks before the military command disclosed Sunday an abortive coup attempt by <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> supporters. <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> says the report was fabricated to distract Sudanese from the country's myriad problems. Four journalists have been arrested and one newspaper closed down in connection with the reported coup attempt. <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanbali </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Sudanese Journalists' Union, said the government should use the courts, not detentions and indefinite bans, to prosecute journalists accused of misconduct `` We appreciate the critical circumstances, but this does not justify trangressing the freedom of the press,'' <PERSON> Shanbali </PERSON> said. `` The union rejects any breach of the freedom of the press.'' Press freedom did not exist here during <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>'s 16 years in power. Since his defense minister overthrew him in 1985, however, the government has rid itself of all media organs except the national news agency and official radio and TV stations. The first significant media restriction under the current civilian government came in spring when the army banned reports of military actions in the south, where rebels fighting for more autonomy had captured key towns. One newspaper, the biweekly Al-Rai, apparently was singled out for ignoring the embargo on military news. It was shut down in February and its editor, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Medani </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON>, was arrested. After Sunday's coup plot announcement, security authorities arrested editor-in-chief <PERSON> Khalifa </PERSON> and closed his triweekly Al-Wattan, which had published a series of interviews with <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON>. Also detained this week were <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattar </PERSON>, a journalist with the independent daily Al-Khartoum and three other reporters from Al-Wattan and Al-Rai.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was told Thursday that out-of-staters are trashing <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, leaving <ORGANIZATION> Buckeyes </ORGANIZATION> `` truly enraged'' about having tons of garbage heaped on them by their neighboring states. An <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> official, saying `` we could become the next <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in just a few years,'' urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to slap a $ 40-a-ton fee on long-haul garbage to discourage interstate trafficking in trash. `` We simply do not have adequate disposal capacity to become the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s dumping ground,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahli </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Deieso </PERSON>, assistant commissioner of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION>, said `` we understand completely'' the concerns of states gaining garbage, since <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> had been a dump for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He suggested <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> order every state to become self-sufficient. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> last year took in 2.4 million tons of out-of-state waste, double what came in the previous year. Nearly 20 percent of the waste disposed of in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is generated elsewhere and the heap is growing, <PERSON> Sahli </PERSON> told the transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee. Landfills are filling up or being closed because of pollution problems, <PERSON> Sahli </PERSON> said. `` We in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> have a home-grown crisis on our hands,'' he said. `` The importing of wastes has truly enraged the citizens of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>.'' `` We're the dumping ground,'' agreed Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee. Witnesses said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> is n't alone. The <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said 15,000 landfills have closed over the past 10 years, leaving about 5,000 nationwide. All of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s landfills must close within 10 years because of threats to groundwater, the environmental group added. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Templet </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>, said that state is down to 40 landfills, compared with 800 in operation in 1980. `` Solid waste management in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> has reached crisis proportions,'' said <PERSON> Templet </PERSON>, who asked the subcommittee to consider a national recycling program and strict landfill guidelines. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said his state has been `` victimized by the lack of federal policy'' on solid waste. `` States like mine are virtually unprotected,'' he told the panel. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> asked the panel to consider his bill giving states the right to reject the interstate transfer of solid waste. Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., said he was introducing legislation to treat trash the same way the government treats low-level radioactive waste His bill would force states to develop regional compacts to deal with the garbage problem collectively. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> official asked the panel to tax garbage sent long distances and then use the money to encourage recycling and to increase <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> funding for developing better ways of handling solid waste. `` Such a tax would act as an incentive to states to take care of their own waste disposal needs and not create devastating economic dislocation and potential environmental problems in communities located hundreds of miles away,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people demonstrated in four cities on Thursday to protest the expected candidacy of <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> for the new post of president. About 3,500 people rallied in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and from 100 to 150 in the port of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> to the west and <LOCATION> Katowice </LOCATION> in the south, organizers and the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. On Wednesday, at least 3,000 demonstrators in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION> chanted `` Soviets go home!'' and marched by the Soviet Consulate and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, were some protesters hurled coins that broke windows. Organizers said police officers watched the demonstrations and did not intervene. The Wroclaw protest was organized by supporters of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Fighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said a spokeswoman for the groups, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinior </PERSON>. The protesters denounced <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and laid wreaths at a symbolic monument to victims of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on dissent. In <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, about 150 people chanted `` <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> must go!'' and marched to the party headquarters, which they sprayed with slogans, said a witness. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said Fighting Solidarity organized the <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> and Katowice demonstrations and that protesters shouted slogans `` insulting'' to <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Organizers said the protests will continue in various cities until <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> votes on the presidency. The election is expected before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> begins a state visit July 9. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, is expected to be nominated by the party. The presidency was created as part of the reforms negotiated by the Solidarity-backed opposition and the government earlier this year. Solidarity was legalized after a seven-year ban and participated in the parliamentary elections held this month. Candidates backed by the trade union won all but one of the seats available to the opposition. But the party appears to have enough votes to elect <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> president.

 A woman accused of `` shopping around'' at nurseries for a baby to steal was convicted Thursday of killing a couple she had stalked for days, snatching their 9-day-old son and trying to pass him off as her own. Jurors who found <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> guilty on all counts meet Friday to begin deciding whether she should be executed by lethal injection or sentenced to life in prison without probation or parole. Mrs. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, 36, had accused her husband, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, of killing <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> on Christmas Eve 1987, drugging her and duping her into believing that she had given birth. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, 27, faces a trial in September. Both were charged with two counts of murder, two counts of felony murder, one count of conspiracy and one count each of possession of a deadly weapon during the commission of a felony, burglary and unlawful imprisonment. The state contends the Lynches shot the <ORGANIZATION> Gibsons </ORGANIZATION> and took 9-day-old <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> because Mrs. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> could no longer have children. Prosecutors accused them of `` shopping around'' at nurseries `` until they stumbled upon <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>.'' `` They hunted the <ORGANIZATION> Gibsons </ORGANIZATION> down, stalked them for at least a week and murdered them to get that child,'' Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> said during closing arguments Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Kent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. During 16 days of testimony, the defense portrayed Mrs. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> as a victim of her husband. She claimed <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> controlled her by injecting her with overdoses of a prescription pain-killer she needed for a back ailment. Mrs. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who had two children from a previous marriage, also claimed her husband duped her into believing she was pregnant, and told her she had given birth to <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> while she was asleep. She said she was at the crime scene, but because she was heavily drugged, she thought it was a dream. When she awakened, there was a baby. The state contended she was the mastermind because she knew she had had a hysterectomy in 1978. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 32, was found in a pool of blood by his then-5-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, and 1-year-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 27, was found slumped over the steering wheel of her car, clutching the cloth diaper she used when burping <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>. The prosecution said one of the Lynches took <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> from her arms. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> was with the Lynches when they were arrested Jan. 7, 1988. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> and his brother and sister have been raised by their paternal grandparents.

 A retired <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> colonel said Thursday he had made a solo flight over the North Pole in a single-engine plane. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said he flew from <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in 19 hours, 58 minutes, and claimed a world record for the solo 2,970-mile flight in his Beechcraft Bonanza BE-36. There was no independent verification. Officials at <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>'s airport said <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> landed about 7 p.m., but they did not know were he came from. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said he planned the trip for midsummer so he could use the arctic's seasonal 24-hour sunlight to help him navigate. He said he had to make adjustments to his gyro-compass every 20 minutes to keep from straying off course. He also navigated by sun sightings, a sun dial and radio direction-finding equipment. `` I chose <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> from Point Barrow to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> because it's a straight line over the North Pole,'' he said. `` If I went to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, then somebody could say I went beside the North Pole.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said he flew over ice for most of the trip and said clouds often blocked his view, but he made some videotapes. He flew near the west end of <LOCATION> Spitzbergen </LOCATION> island and over <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> in the Beechcraft. He had planned to fly at 160 mph at an altitude of 3,000 to 5,000 feet. <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, a former fighter pilot, said he has more than 14,000 hours of flight time, including solo flights from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and back. He left south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on June 13 and plans to return via <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next month.

 President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> on Thursday convened the first military review meeting since the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and said the goverment needs `` a new tempo and dramatic steps'' to fight the guerrillas. `` It is too early to talk about final victory,'' <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> told members of the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and military commanders from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s 28 provinces. `` We should think in terms of how to get rid of the imposed war and put an end to it.'' Western journalists were invited to attend the inauguration of the meeting, held a day after <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> announced it had a broken a 15-week rebel siege of the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>. Guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> denied the claim. The lifting of the siege would represent the biggest military victory for the government since the last Soviet troops withdrew in February, ending their nine-year involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The military review was the first since the Soviet withdrawal, and diplomats say it was called to plan a new strategy against the rebels. <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> used the occasion to renew attacks on <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, which supports the Moslem guerrillas fighting <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s Soviet-backed government. `` The grave dangers emanating from the satanic plans of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> ... pose a serious threat to peace, security and stability in the region,'' he said. The president also said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and other rebel supporters `` did not want to stop the war, they want to continue the bloodshed.''

<HEAD>Forest Service Chief Say Owl Data Too Skimpy to Reduce Logging</HEAD>

 Too little is known about the spotted owl to justify closing off vast portions of the ancient forests of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> to logging, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` I do n't think we ought to penalize the people of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, throw people out of work, close down towns, until a biological decision can be made properly,'' <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said as two <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees wrapped up two days of joint hearings. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said his agency has begun a five-year study of the owl, which is thought to nest only in the old-growth forests of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He said there was insufficient scientific on the owl to justify a 50 percent reduction in the timber harvest from the national forests of the Northwest this year. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> has enjoined the agency from offering 162 timber sales planned during the current fiscal year in those forests involving 1.4 billion board feet. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said that represents roughly 25 percent of the timber sale program scheduled this year and said the injunction might be expanded so it would eventually affect sales involving 2.5 billion board feet or half of the sales planned in the region. The injunction was sought by environmentalists who want to have the owl protected as a threatened or endangered species as part of their campaign to halt logging in the old-growth forests of the Northwest. The timber industry has claimed such protection would create an economic catastrophe for dozens of one-mill towns in the region. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has proposed the owl for listing as a threatened species, but it will take between 18 months and two years before a final decision is made. The hearings were held by the national parks and public lands subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the forests, family farms and energy subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said that 60 percent of the timber available for harvest in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was old-growth, much of it prime habitat for the spotted owl. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> faced harsh criticism from <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>, who charged the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> had done little since the injunction was issued four months ago to soften its impact on the region. `` Are you trying to precipitate a crisis in the hope that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will bail you out?'' <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> asked, adding that the agency has yet to appeal the injunction and took two months before it responded to a letter he wrote asking if there were alternative sales that could be offered quickly.

<TEXT>
 Labor representatives at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s second largest shipyard Thursday rejected a 20 percent pay increase negotiated by their union leaders, dimming prospects for the debt-stricken business Managers of <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Okpo </LOCATION>, off the south coast, threatened to shut down the facility if workers strike. Company and labor union leaders had reached a tentative agreement to give the 13,000 workers an average 20 percent pay rise from Jan. 1 next year. But the union's 54-member executive committe turned down the agreement by a vote of 28-26. Hard-line union leaders demanded an immediate increase. Yard workers earn an average $ 525 a month and company officials say large wage increases would put the shipyard out of business. Workers demanded a 53 percent pay raise May 9. Management responded with a wage freeze and threatened to close the yard. The shipyard at <LOCATION> Koje </LOCATION> island was virtually shut down May 29, when two workers died after setting themselves on fire in protest. The trouble started two months after the government deployed police and used strongarm tactics that left hundreds of people injured to end a prolonged strike at <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heavy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest shipyard. Government officials have urged <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> workers and company officials to continue negotiating and suspended a $ 600 million rescue package for the yard, which is about $ 1.6 billion in debt. <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> had to raise another $ 600 million on its own. The shipyard opened in 1981 and can build up to 1.2 million tons of shipping a year _ 30 percent of the country's combined shipbuilding capacity. <ORGANIZATION> Daewoo </ORGANIZATION> has a backlog of foreign orders worth $ 1.17 billion.

 The African <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday three of its officials were wounded in a bomb blast in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, and it accused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> of starting a new terror campaign. Wednesday night's blast in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> was the fourth bombing this week in the Zambian capital, said <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>. One official of the guerrrilla organization was seriously injured in the latest explosion, which destroyed an <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> welfare office, he said. `` A new phase of bombings and assassinations by South African agents appears to have begun and we are stepping up our security,'' <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> said. In the worst incident, two bombs near the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in downtown <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION> damaged a gasoline station and killed one man on Monday. Police said they believe the victim was carrying the bomb that killed him. No one was killed in the other blasts.

One of the aims of South African sabotage is `` to create conditions whereby our host governments will become jittery about our presence,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday dropped plans to merge their computer reservation systems because the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> threatened to sue to block the $ 2 billion joint venture. `` The likely result of this transaction would be higher fares and poorer service for airline passengers,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement announcing the department's intention to file a civil antitrust suit. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> announced that the two carriers had given up trying to merge their computer then said, `` We decided it would take too much time to fight this in court. American operates <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION>, the leading system among the five used by practically all airlines and travel agents. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s system is Datas II, the smallest of the CRS _ for computer reservation system _ ventures. `` We feel that Justice is wrong,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` We really were surprised. We felt that this partnership was giving the government what it wanted, in terms of taking the -LRB- reservation -RRB- systems out of the ownership of individual airlines, making it an autonomous company.'' Said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crandall </PERSON>, chairman and president of American: `` While the decision clearly means that we can not create a joint venture with another domestic airline that sponsors a competing CRS, we will continue to offer partnership interests in Sabre to domestic airlines which do not sponsor a competing CRS, to foreign airlines and to other interested companies.'' The computer systems provide up-to-the minute information on video screens about schedules, fares, seat availability, hotels, car rentals and package vacations. They allow users to make reservations and issue tickets in seconds, and are the primary channel for the distribution of tickets. The systems give airlines the practically instantaneous data on seat sales that lets the carriers quickly change prices, blackout dates, advance purchase requirements and other conditions that form their `` yield management'' strategies. American's <ORGANIZATION> Sabre </ORGANIZATION> had $ 445 million in fee revenues and approximately 41 percent of the national market in 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>'s 7-year-old Datas II is the youngest system, with about $ 68 million in revenues and approximately 7 percent of the market. The three other systems are joint operations of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. In 1986, travel agents paid about $ 287 million in fees to the systems and airlines paid $ 600 million, the department said. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the lawsuit would allege that the joint venture would violate the <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> acts because it likely would substantially lessen competition both in the sale of services to travel agents and in the provision of scheduled airline passenger service. `` Travel agents using a particular <ORGANIZATION> CRS </ORGANIZATION> tend to sell a disproportionately high number of tickets on that <ORGANIZATION> CRS </ORGANIZATION> owner's airline,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whalley </PERSON>, acting assistant attorney general in the antitrust division Since 1986, airlines have been forbidden to favor their own flights in the computer display listings. <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said his company and American intended to sell up to 50 percent of the merged system to other airlines and already had received expressions of interest from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lufthansa </ORGANIZATION> and more than a dozen other carriers. `` Last week, we became aware that <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> felt it had a problem with this partnership,'' <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said. `` We attempted to resolve it. There was really nothing we could do.''

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> appealed to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to back the measured response of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to abuses of human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> responded with a unanimous show of support. But <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> called for a more forceful renunciation of the executions being carried out despite an appeal by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to Chinese leaders to show clemency. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, in a floor speech, said he understood `` the delicate situation in which the president finds himself.'' And, the majority leader said, `` I support the stated desire to maintain, if possible, some relationship with the Chinese government.'' But, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, `` I ask _ I urge _ the president to condemn these acts personally and in the strongest possible terms, to give voice to the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, told a luncheon in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> `` we're all very concerned'' about developments in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Later, White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the president against <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s charges `` We feel the administration has spoken out loudly, strongly and without reservation on this issue,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We've spoken out forcefully, more than any other country in the world. Our words speak for themselves. There's no need to repeat different words every day of the week.'' Asked specifically to react to the latest wave of executions, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There's a great sense of sadness and disappointment that world opinion has not had an influence on the actions of the Chinese.'' Twenty-seven people reportedly have been executed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Thousands have been arrested as authorities extend their crackdown on advocates of a more liberal communist system. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, testifying before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was first among the countries around the world to respond to the assault on students June 3-4 in Tiananmen Square. `` What we have done is to take carefully targeted actions without being inflammatory in our rhetoric and preserving options for the future,'' he said. That approach, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` does n't necessarily extend to others.'' But while he recognized <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might want to take a different stance, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said `` in the past when we have not spoken with one voice in the conduct of our foreign policy we've almost always failed.'' Therefore, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to bank its fire and recognize that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> relationship with the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, carefully cultivated over the past 15 years, had other considerations besides human rights. `` I think we should act and speak in one voice, and act in a coordinated way to address this very, very difficult foreign policy problem,'' he said. The House later voted 416-0 for a non-binding resolution condemning the `` murderous crackdown and brutal repression of the pro-democracy movement'' and supporting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s call for clemency for demonstrators. `` This is an issue on which there is no disagreement in this House or among the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said the measure's sponsor, Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` It is essential now for us to tell the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government that there can be no business as usual as long as they continue brutal repression of their own people.'' Before the vote, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., told reporters, `` I would like to see the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the president stand together on these issues, and I do not favor actions that are n't taken in consultation with the administration. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> added that `` the stand that has been taken is very clear'' and said additional sanctions could lead to `` a complete breach'' in U.S.-China relations while having no positive effect. `` That will not accomplish anything that I can see for the benefit of the democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, or for the individual rights of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students, and I think we ought to keep some concern about the maintenance of the relationship.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initial response to the shootings in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> was to suspend <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military transactions and contacts with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Then, as the suppression continued, he withheld <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for international loans to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and prohibited visits by senior adinistration officials. `` I believe we have made it abundantly clear, both what we said and in our actions, that while they may be able to clear the Square they wo n't be able to clear their conscience,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said of the Chinese leaders. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, citing fresh news reports that seven more `` rioters'' had been put to death, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was more reticent than other world figures in denouncing the Chinese government. The senator said the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had made statements more forceful than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who deplored the attack in Tiananman Square and said he admired the protesters. `` I ask him not to refuse to answer questions about these matters,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, `` but to step forward voluntarily to speak out. ... I urge the president to assume the proper role as the spokesman for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, as the leader of the free world, to condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said his view had been misunderstood as protective only of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and commercial ties with the world's most populous nation. Actually, he said, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy must consider geopolitical ties. `` There are countervailing considerations,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was confronted by calls from members of the committee for the administration to go beyond the sanctions imposed against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to stronger measures and more consistent denunciation of arrests and executions. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he and other lawmakers were planning to propose a package of sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> tougher than <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s suspension of military and diplomatic visits and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms transactions. <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, who met this week with Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON>, did not elaborate. Rep. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, urged <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to keep in mind <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>, the pre-World War II prime minister of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> whom many historians accuse of pursuing a failed policy of appeasement toward <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, R-Wash., said he was exhilarated by the administration's `` splendid performance. But he advised <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to denounce the executions with an outrage that ` ` the Chinese and the people of the world would hear. Two senior members of the committee, Reps. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, R-Mich., and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., supported the administration <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> said the president was doing his job properly, and <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> told <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, `` I think you have handled the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> problem very well.'' Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, meanwhile, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would respond appropriately if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> halts repressive actions that are souring its relations with the West.'' In a speech to an Asian Policy Conference sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative research organization, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a duty `` to denounce the brutal suppression of popular and peaceful demonstrations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> ... to condemn the Orwellian inversion of truth'' about the slaying of civilian demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> added Thursday to a string of defeats for civil rights forces with a decision that gives cities new protection against certain lawsuits accusing them of racial bias and other violations. Voting 5-4, the justices used the case of a former <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> high school football coach to narrow the scope of a century-old civil rights law. The coach said he was transferred to another school because he is white. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, writing for the court, said the 1866 law can be used to sue a city only if it can be proved the alleged violation of civil rights was part of an official municipal policy. It is not enough to show that a city employee, acting in an official capacity, violated someone's rights, she said. `` Once those officials who have the power to make official policy on a particular issue have been identified, it is for the jury to determine whether their decisions have caused the deprivation of rights at issue by policies which affirmatively command that it occur,'' she said. The high court previously limited a civil rights law enacted in 1871 _ a statute also known as the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> Klan Act _ in the same way. Thursday's ruling is particularly significant because of the potential big-money damages the 1866 law provides for winners of such suits. The ruling is the latest in a series of defeats handed civil rights plaintiffs this year by a newly solidified conservative majority on the court. In a dissenting opinion, Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said the latest decision is `` astonishing'' because the court did not allow pro-civil rights forces to present their side fully. `` It is not only unfair to decide the case on this basis,'' he said. `` It is unwise.'' The court ruled against <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jett </PERSON>, longtime coach and athletic director at <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. He sued the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> and others. A federal jury awarded <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> $ 850,000 in damages, reduced by a federal trial judge to about $ 563,000. A federal appeals court overturned the award. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> could get a new trial to determine whether he can recover any money from the school district. But the decision makes his case considerably more difficult to prove. <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said a federal appeals court could grant <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> a new trial against the city only if it determines that the school superintendent who ordered him transferred had policy-making authority granted by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law in the area of employee transfers. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> had coached the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> football team since 1962 when, in the spring of 1983, he was transferred to another city high school. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> had been named head coach and athletic director at the school in 1970, the year the racial composition at <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliff </LOCATION> changed from predominantly white to predominantly black. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cliff </LOCATION>'s black principal who held that job since 1975, was also sued by <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> for replacing him with a black coach. According to court records, the relationship between <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> grew more tense after <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> lost to <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION> in the state high school championship in November 1982. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> believed that the only way for South Oak Cliff to compete was to hire a black coach who in turn would recruit black players. <PERSON> Jett </PERSON> said that school officials violated his due-process, free-speech and equal-protection rights. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> was joined in dissent by Justices <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. Joining <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

 Women who once knocked on the doors of all-male clubs to try to crack the good old boys' network formed their own informal grapevine Thursday to boost members of their sex. Members of the Association of Good Old Girls, AGOG, promise never to make decisions in a locker room, in a bar or on the golf course. `` It's fun and it's serious at the same time,'' said <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, who helped found the group. Fifteen women gathered amidst exhibits on feminist history at the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame for the first AGOG meeting. They raised their right hands and, shouting `` AGOG,'' they pledged to function as an informal network of women helping other women climb to the top in their business or profession, just as men have done by swapping information over drinks or lunch. <PERSON> Rachael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, a co-founder of the association, said the women are trying to copy the good old boy network, rather than dismantle it, because they know it works. Boys begin training to join the network when they are youngsters by taking part in sports that teach cooperation and teamwork, she said. As adults, men holding top positions socialize with each other and learn about job openings, business opportunities and promotion possibilities, she said. `` That's the topic of their social interaction and because there are so few women in similar positions it's very difficult for women to have access to those same pieces of information,'' she said. Any man or woman who is willing to help women get ahead is a member in good standing of AGOG, said <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who dreamed up the name because she liked the meaning of `` agog'' _ intense excitement. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, an associate superintendent of <ORGANIZATION> Genesee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said women already are giving each other a helping hand up the corporate level. `` From whatever position I hold or whatever organization I belong to, I make sure women have the opportunity to participate, to be promoted, to have some visibility and most of all to learn from real experiences, learn about leadership,'' she said. But she said the good old girls network needs the extra visibility that a semi-serious organization like AGOG can give it. `` I do n't believe that we have the numbers yet because it takes women in almost every organization, agency and industry in order to establish that kind of comprehensive network,'' she said. The group, which includes women in real estate, higher education and politics, has a copyright on its name and a logo, three female stick figures with hands joined. They plan to offer information to women around the country who want to form their own chapters.

 Plans to attempt an override of Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s latest veto of legislation to restore the death penalty in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state were scrapped Thursday because of a key senator's illness <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> governors have vetoed death penalty bills every year since 1977. State <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> said the override vote, which had been expected Tuesday, was being postponed indefinitely because of new cancer surgery for state Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> issued a statement saying he would enter Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Monday for surgery Wednesday. The bill's chief sponsor, state Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Volker </PERSON>, had said earlier that without <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>'s support he had almost no chance of winning the override test in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, 65, who underwent surgery in early May for colon cancer, went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday for tests at Sloan-Kettering. A consistent death penalty supporter in the past, <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> stunned his colleagues last week when he said his bout with cancer had caused him to have second thoughts about the death penalty. On Monday, <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> had returned to <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> for the first time since his May surgery and <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> sent a state helicopter to <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>'s home to pick him up for a lengthy lunch at the Executive Mansion Emerging from that lunch, <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> said he still was n't certain how he would vote on the override attempt. But he added: `` If you were standing where I am and your life was in danger, you would have some second thoughts.'' For the past four years, the Republican-controlled state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has successfully voted to override <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s death penalty vetoes but the effort has repeatedly fallen short in the Democratic-controlled Assembly. This year, death penalty supporters felt they were within one vote of winning in the Assembly before problems began appearing in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. In February, state Sen. <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> was convicted of a federal felony that eventually cost him his seat. The Democrat had voted for the death penalty in recent years. With <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> gone, <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> could only count on 41 votes for an override, the exact number needed in the 61-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. And that assumed that <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON> would vote for the death penalty. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s electric chair has n't been used since 1963.

A soil organism, Bacillus thuringiensis, contains a gene for a protein that becomes toxic when eaten by caterpillars. This gene was added to a second bacterium, Clavibacter xyli -LRB- subspecies cynodontis -RRB-, which can live within the rice plant. By combining the two, scientists hope rice plants can have built-in protection against insect pests.

<TEXT>
 Leading Politburo reformers, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is sharply divided, prepared for a crucial meeting Friday at which some seek the ouster of centrist party chief <PERSON> Karoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>. Politburo member <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, considered a reformist challenger to <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>, told the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting will be advised to keep on <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> until a party congress this fall. But he said Friday's session `` may not be able to arrive at lasting solutions'' on personnel or policy. `` In these rapidly changing times, there can be unexpected factors, and questions may arise concerning the party leaders'' and makeup of the Politburo, <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> said. His remarks follow weeks of increasingly open struggle between reformers and more orthodox Communists. <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> has been party general secretary for only 13 months and seems to have lost the center ground he sought between the two factions. Poszgay and other reformers meanwhile have backed new `` reform circles'' inside the party and, outside, a Movement for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hungary </ORGANIZATION> in anticipation of a possible party split. Politburo member <PERSON> Reszoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> told Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Nepszabadsag </ORGANIZATION> party daily that he does not expect a formal split Friday. But he admitted that `` personal cooperation'' in top party echelons has sunk to a minimum. `` The party is undoubtedly in crisis because of a lack of clarification in the concepts of internal trends,'' <PERSON> Nyers </PERSON> said. `` There is no determined core in the party capable of integration,'' he added, blaming `` extreme views'' for the lack of unity. Three regional reform groups this week openly called for <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>'s ouster at Friday's meeting Western analysts following <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s rapid embrace of democratic reforms over the past year say that replacing <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit next month could damage the image of stability <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> seeks in the West. <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> is looking to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit to cement efforts to gain badly needed Western aid to restructure the stagnating economy and help pay off a $ 17-billion foreign debt. But a weekly in western <LOCATION> Gyoer </LOCATION> city this week quotes a local party reformer as saying <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON> should go now because he is `` a reformer in word, and not in deed.'' Influential party reformists in the southern areas of <LOCATION> Csongrad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION> city issued separate calls for <PERSON> Grosz </PERSON>' replacement. The power struggle comes as the party is negotiating with opposition groups over a timetable and regulations for multiparty elections to be held by next summer.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> suspended <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s ruling party Thursday on grounds it rigged elections. The 81-member congress of Western socialist parties also said it deplored the `` bloody repression'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and called for an international conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. At the end of a three-day congress, delegates unanimously approved a Latin American proposal to suspend the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Delegates condemned the `` manipulation of the electoral process in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and demand that the democratic will of the people is respected.'' <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s government said its candidate won the May 7 presidential election, but international the observers alleged widespread fraud and said the opposition won handily. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, boycotted the meeting after the the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> allowed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to attend as observers. `` The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> should take part in the peace process in the region.

 Two inmates at the <ORGANIZATION> J.B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> used their skills to get out of prison for four hours Thursday and attend a wine-and-cheese reception. Their only tools were pencils and felt-tip pens. Inmates <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> were special guests at the formal opening of an art gallery's three-week exhibition of 32 drawings and paintings by <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> inmates. Prison officials, including Gates Warden <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guay </PERSON>, and some of the families of the inmate-artists also attended the reception at the Vangarde Gallery. `` This is just the thing he might need to get him going in the right direction again,'' said <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON>' mother, <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Canning </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, who greeted her 22-year-old son with a big hug. `` He's certainly got the talent. Sticking to a vow she had made not to visit her son in prison if he got in trouble again, Canning had not seen him since he was sentenced last October to 18 months for robbery. The works on display range from an oil painting of a barnyard scene and a colored pencil drawing of a tearful boy holding a fluffy white dog to surrealistic portrayals of prison life and frightening renderings of skulls and bones, blood and death. The inmates, who will get to keep all the proceeds, have priced the paintings and drawings anywhere from $ 25 to $ 4,000, for a copy of a Rembrandt. The show opened Saturday and two drawings had sold in the first five days. One of <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON>' works _ a stylized drawing of a dog _ was the second to be sold. The price was $ 100. `` I was n't too sure on my work. I did n't know I had the artistic talent. I was content just having my work be good enough to be entered in an art gallery,'' said <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON>, 30, who is serving time for narcotics possession and is due for release this October. <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> said drawing has become `` a whole new way of relief for me. it lets me channel my feelings.'' Inmates like <PERSON> DuBois </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> have been taking art classes as part of the 5-year-old Arts in Correction program run by the private, non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Allyson </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtz </PERSON>, the program's coordinator and one of the inmates' art teachers. Nine professional artists hired by the organization have been going into nine prisons across the state to provide 12-week courses on such subjects as drawing, creative writing, dance and music. `` It gives us a very therapeutic activity that reduces idle time, which benefits inmates and staff alike,'' said <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Kulmacz </PERSON>, director of volunteer services for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correction </ORGANIZATION>, which helps fund the program. This is the second year an exhibition of inmates' work has been staged at a private gallery, but the first that any inmates attended, <PERSON> Holtz </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>FAA Tightens Checks On Electronic Devices, Rejects Outright Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government Thursday ordered tighter screening of cassette recorders, lap-top computers and other electronic devices on some international flights, but rejected calls to ban all such items from airliners. Relatives of some of the 270 people killed in the December bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> had called for the ban after investigators said plastic explosives concealed in a radio cassette player destroyed the plane. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, announcing the measures, indicated a ban would unduly inconvenience passengers and would not likely be imposed by other nations. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> measures would take effect immediately and would include `` more than just turning on and off'' the equipment. He said inspectors would go through a series of checks, including possibly opening the devices. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he expected several other countries to announce similar increased screening. British authorities are continuing their investigation into who planted the bomb on the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight. Plastic explosives can not be detected by ordinary X-ray screening, and the <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines to begin installing equipment that can detect plastic explosives in luggage at airports throughout the world. Officials acknowledge it could take two years or more to finish the job. The new order applies only to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flights originating in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. It will not affect non-U.S. airlines, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic flights, flights from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> or the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> or flights to and from other countries. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the step was the result of consultation with top transportation officials of other countries. Officials agree, he said, that increased screening is the most `` acceptable and effective'' method of dealing with the danger. `` It is my firm belief that the option we have selected provides the proper balance between passenger safety and convenience at this time,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said in a speech to an air freight group. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said in a news release that additional time may be required at airport screening points because of the procedures. Some airlines already conduct such screening. `` If electronic devices are not needed on a particular trip, passengers should consider leaving them behind,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The step is the lastest in several security measures taken by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> since the Pan Am bombing, including X-ray or physical examination of all checked baggage, random checks of carry-on bags and mandatory fines for airline passengers who try to carry weapons past screening points.

 <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, a 20-term Democratic congressman from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, received emergency medical attention Thursday after bumping his knee in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber. He later said he `` almost fainted because the pain was so intense.'' Six white-coated members of the congressional medical staff rushed to the aid of the 79-year-old lawmaker from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> at about 12:30 p.m. EDT when he fell forward in a seat after voting on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. They put a blood-pressure cuff on his left arm and what appeared to be a heart monitor on his chest, and talked to him for about 15 minutes before taking him out of the chamber in a wheelchair. He said he felt fine, though he was pale, when he left for more examination at the attending physician's office in the Capitol. `` I'm feeling very well,'' he said later by telephone from his office. `` I voted and I was on my way back, turning up the aisle and bumped my knee.

 Drought a year ago bit deeply into the 1988 corn crop but did n't do much damage to the grain that was harvested, an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report said Thursday. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said the drought had little impact on the `` quality characteristics'' of last year's corn, including test weights, moisture and kernel damage. The annual report did not include statistics for aflatoxin content of the 1988 corn harvest. Aflatoxin is a cancer-causing substance that can result from certain kinds of fungus under drought stress conditions. Some corn harvested last fall had been reported as having high levels of aflatoxin, prompting fears that the tainted grain could cause harm in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> food chain.

<HEAD>Pentagon Official Confident Bomber Will Perform as Anticipated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official in charge of testing new weapons said Thursday he is confident the B-2 bomber, set to be flown in a few weeks, will perform as anticipated. `` I do n't see any indications the B-2 ca n't do what it intends to do,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krings </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Operational Test and Evaluation office, told reporters However, <PERSON> Krings </PERSON>, who is leaving at the end of the month, refused to discuss whether he thought the B-2, the so-called Stealth, was worth the money, a question raised by some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> said politicians and defense analysts will have to decide if they're willing to pay for the bomber. Each B-2 bomber is expected to cost over $ 500 million and there are plans to build 132 of them. <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is building the plane at its <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, plant. The plane, described as resembling a `` flying wing'' without conventional fuselage, is designed to penetrate Soviet borders without being detected by radar. The plane has no sharp angles and relies on the use of radar-absorbing coatings on its surface, officials have said. <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> said the B-2 has not been operationally tested in the field yet, but individual systems were tried out along the way. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> says the B-2 will not be deployed before 1991. Meantime, <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> defended the record of his office, which has been criticized by some lawmakers who say it has failed to test weapons adequately and is too cozy with defense contracting firms. <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> said his office had succeeded in forcing the services to improve the weapons before they are deployed. `` The list that did n't go into production because of our arguments, there were many, but they are sometimes hard to find,'' he said. For instance, some contractors have delayed testing in order not to fail, he said. They say, `` We are delaying because we do n't want to fail the test,'' he said. As an example, he cited the testing of cellular radios that were postponed for about four months.

<TEXT>
 Female veterans often miss out on benefits for which they qualify because they have a low opinion of their service records, witnesses told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday. `` They do n't see themselves as veterans,'' said retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Shea-Buckley </PERSON>, chairwoman of the advisory committee on women veterans for the Department of Veterans Affairs. `` They feel that only men are veterans. They say things like ` I only served two years. I did n't go overseas.''' Women can get all the benefits available to male veterans as long as they have spent one year in service, said Dr. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>, chief of women's programs for the Department of Veterans Affairs. One estimate says women make up 4 percent of all veterans. Among those benefits are extensive health care opportunities, educational assistance and housing loans. Rep. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, D-Ill., chairman of the Veterans Affairs subcommittee on oversight and investigations, called the hearing as a follow-up to the first hearing on the subject two years ago `` We want to learn what progress has been made during the last two years in realizing the equitable provision of benefits and services to women veterans,'' said <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a military nurse who is chairwoman of the advisory commission on women veterans in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, told of a veterans hospital in her state is ill equipped to give women even basic service. <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lyons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> had only men's pajamas, no personal sanitary supplies and no gynecological clinic for out-patients. She said by contrast, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, provides women those basic medical needs. `` Not all VA hospitals are created equal in terms of facilities, supplies or services provided veterans,'' said <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said that in the last six or seven years the attitude of the government toward female veterans has improved, though `` it may not have filtered down to every level.'' <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> shared <PERSON> Shea-Buckley </PERSON>'s opinion about getting women to come forward as veterans. `` In particular, certain <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> era women veterans speak of being ridiculed by family and friends upon their return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> said. She said they do n't act proud of their service or use it to gain benefits rightfully theirs. `` When pressed for details, they often reply, ` I'd rather forget that part of my life,''' she said. She said World War II veterans are most vocal about their needs, primarily nursing care since they are now among the aging population. The 1980 Census, the first to ask women if they were veterans, counted 1.13 million women had served in the armed forces. That was 3.1 percent of the veteran population. Female veterans' now are believed to comprise about 4 percent of the veteran population, said <PERSON> Mather </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Crippled Tanker To Be Moved Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nearly three months after it caused the nation's worst oil spill, the damaged tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> will be towed out of Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> on Friday for a $ 25 million repair job in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, authorities said. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said the 987-foot vessel will leave the shelter of <LOCATION> Outside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> on the southwest side of Naked Island in the heart of the sound during the morning, weather permitting. The Exxon Valdez has been undergoing temporary repairs at Outside Bay since about two weeks after it ran aground at <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> on March 24, ripping its hull and spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil drawn from wells on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s North Slope. Eight of the vessel's 13 tanks were penetrated by the reef and divers reported finding rocks as large as small cars in the cargo hold. But the tanks have been cleaned to the point that small schools of herring and salmon have been reported living in them. The hull also has been steam-cleaned. Divers drilled numerous holes along many cracks in the hull and plated over them to keep the cracks from spreading. One crack was said to run through the hull until about midship. The cracks had to be immobilized with plates out of concern that rough seas could break the vessel in half. Several of the vessel's tanks remain unsealed, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said. Coast Guard and salvage officials said air pressure in the tanks would keep seawater at maneageable levels. The tanker will be towed by two tugs, and accompanied by a salvage vessel and a third tug. But <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said the tanker's engines are in working order and will be be used at the skipper's discretion. Since the spill, oil has soiled more than 700 miles of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s southern coastline Some of the oil has flushed out of the sound and traveled with <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> currents some 400 miles to <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. Workers have recovered more than 26,000 birds killed by the oil, although biologists say the figure probably represents 10 percent or less of the overall toll. Other casualties have included more than 50 eagles and nearly 800 sea otters. The spill forced closure of numerous herring and salmon fisheries and severely curtailed others. Exxon has more than 9,000 people, backed up by 800 boats and a small air force, working to clean up the spill. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> said this week it already has spent more than $ 200 million on the job, and the state has billed <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 12 million for oil-spill expenses. Under a procedure established two weeks after the spill, the state sends its bills to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, which pays most of the suppliers and contractors directly and reimburses the state for out-of-pocket costs, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nizich </PERSON>, administrative services director for Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON>'s office. Batches of invoices have been sent almost daily to <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>. `` Some of them were pretty hefty in size,'' <PERSON> Nizich </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officer will be on board the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> until it leaves Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, about 60 miles from <LOCATION> Naked </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and again when the vessel nears <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, where the ship was built. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said seven Exxon officers and four salvage experts would be on board throughout the voyage, expected to take about 20 days, at about 6 mph. One worker was killed during the cleanup, and there have numerous injuries in boat and plane accidents as well as from falls on oil-slickened beaches. The former captain of the Exxon Valdez, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>, has been charged with six criminal counts arising from the spill. Among other things, the state alleges he was drunk at the time. <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON> has pleaded innocent to all charges. Court officials say it is unlikely his trial will take place until fall or early winter.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can regain the lead in developing magnetically levitated trains with a 300 mph potential, but if it does n't act soon <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will dominate the field, according to a report released Thursday. `` Mag-lev'' will be an important transportation mode by the year 2000, and decisions made in the next five years will determine which country gets the patents and leads the industry, said an advisory committee to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION>. `` Because of the overseas competition evolving in this technology, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s window of opportunity is already beginning to close,'' the committee wrote. Now is the chance for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to leapfrog the competition by creating the second generation of mag-lev trains using superconducting electromagnets, according to the committee. It did not mean the new high-temperature superconductors, but rather the well-understood, extremely low temperature technology used over the past 10 years or so for medical imaging devices, particle accelerators and other devices in high-tech firms around the world. The advisory group prepared the study at the request of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, second-ranking Democrat on the committee and sponsor of legislation authorizing the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> to develop such trains. The report recommends that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government allocate $ 750 million over six years to develop, test and demonstrate several mag-lev prototypes. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Danby </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, co-developers of mag-lev trains, outlined the pluses at a news conference. Among them: they are faster than cars or conventional railroads; they consume less energy than automobiles or airplanes; they pollute less; they can run in any weather and they experience little wear. Mag-lev trains run on a cushion of air above a guideway, suspended by magnets on the train and in the guideway whose like poles repel each other. A moving magnetic field in the guideway attracts a magnet on the train of opposite polarity, pulling the train at high speed. Current magnets hold the train about three-eighths of an inch off the rails; superconducting models could offer higher stability with a six-inch elevation. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pioneered mag-lev transportation in the 1960s and 1970s, but went only as far as building prototypes and scale models, said the report. The effort was abandoned in 1975 for lack of federal funds, `` but was picked up and carried on in a spirit of raging incrementalism by the Japanese.'' `` That <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> walked away from this effort more than a decade ago is demonstrative of the commercial technology lapses our country is prone to stumble into, characterized most visibly by the forfeiting of billion-dollar markets in consumer electronics and dynamic random access memory semiconductors _ two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> inventions commercially exploited by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' the report said. `` We see many benefits. We do n't see any serious drawbacks,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. At present, the Japanese are testing a full-scale 325 mph vehicle. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has tested a similar 256 mph system.

 Celebrated Peruvian novelist <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Thursday after abandoning his bid for the presidency. His decision, announced late Wednesday, sent shock waves through political circles and strengthened the chances of a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> victory in next year's election. Opinion polls showed the famed writer was a solid favorite to defeat former <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> mayor <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrantes </PERSON>, a Marxist, in the presidential election. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, candidate for a center-right coalition, said in a letter released to the press that he was stepping out of the race because of internal disputes within the coalition. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> criticized the `` mediocre and petty'' motives of some within the coalition who raised their own interests above those of the nation. `` The collapse of the Front could open the door of our country to totalitarian Marxism or a bloody military adventure,'' <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> warned in the letter. The letter was directed to former President <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Belaunde </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bedoya </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Along with <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, the parties are the most important components of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which nominated the 53-year-old writer June 4. <PERSON> Belaunde </PERSON>'s party has vowed to present its own candidates in municipal elections in November. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON> has argued instead for single candidates to avoid political warfare among coalition members. The presidential election is expected to be held in March, but an exact date has not been set. The winner will take office on July 28. The writer refused to receive any visitors Wednesday night and left early Thursday for a month-long tour of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, an aide said. <PERSON> Vargas </PERSON> <PERSON> Llosa </PERSON>, best-known as the author of `` Aunt <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> and the Scriptwriter'' among other novels, entered the political arena after organizing a huge demonstration against President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>'s plan to nationalize the banks.

Eighteen moderate or liberal Republicans, meanwhile, sent letters to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> this week urging him to nominate <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, a prominent Wall Street lawyer who was once <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> surfaced following a report that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inadvertently plugged <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> for the position during a gathering of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys at the White House last Friday. Noting that a number of former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys held key jobs in his administration, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` We hope to see yet another _ <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ joining our ranks here soon.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, in Thursday's editions, quoted anonymous White House sources as accusing someone from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of slipping the remark into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>'s chief spokesman, disputed the report saying: `` I just do n't think it happened the way it was described.'' But a <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said presidential aides were `` flabbergasted'' when they heard about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s remarks because the issue of whether to nominate <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> is still under debate there. The source said that the remark about <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> was not part of the speech draft after it had been cleared Thursday night. Any change in the speech would have had to be cleared by an elaborate approval process in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the source said. The Post reported that the remark was given for insertion to the `` card writer'' who digests speeches onto index cards for delivery by the president. During the meeting with <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> did not identify the senators who might mount a filibuster nor did he threaten himself to wage one, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.H. </LOCATION>, another opponent of <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> who attended the meeting, said that he had not heard any word of support for <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> from the White House. `` Based on our concerns, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> so far has declined to make such a nomination,'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. `` It is the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which is lobbying for this candidate, I have n't heard boo from the White House.'' <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> was accompanied to the meeting by <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, the new assistant attorney general for legislative affairs. <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> told the senators that <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> would have no role in selecting nominees for the federal bench, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said. Others attending the meeting included Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., and <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, both supporters of <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON>, <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> `` is replying to the senators' concerns. I still believe that he is going to be nominated and confirmed.''

 Democrats and Republicans rushed to Old Glory's defense Thursday as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed a resolution condemning the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision giving First Amendment protection to those who desecrate the American flag In addition to the resolution urging the high court to reconsider Wednesday's decision, a variety of bills aimed at circumventing the ruling were tossed into legislative hoppers. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has believed that the act of desecrating the flag is clearly not ` speech' as protected by the First Amendment,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> resolution, co-sponsored by Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, and Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. The resolution, which passed 97-3, voiced alarm that the ruling may invalidate federal law and statutes in 48 states prohibiting destruction of the flag. Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, both Democrats, and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, a Republican, voted against the resolution. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` has the last word on the meaning of the Constitution'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> should n't go on record criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for carrying out its duty. <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> said that while he did n't like anyone burning or defacing the flag, he asked, `` What defines desecration?'' `` This seems to me to be an exercise in silliness and a little bit of hypocrisy,'' he said. `` It strikes me as intellectually dishonest.'' The high court, in a 5-4 vote, threw out the conviction of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was sentenced to a year in jail and fined $ 2,000 for burning the flag in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The court said the flag burning at a demonstration in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> during the 1984 Republican National Convention was a form of expression protected by the Constitution's guarantee of freedom of speech. The decision was greeted with virtually universal outrage on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` Shame on these judges,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>. `` Shame on you, shame on you!.'' `` We must stand for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The flag, the flag. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. For us!'' bellowed Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION> `` The First Amendment guarantees everyone the freedom to speak, but it guarantees no one an audience for his words,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a former federal judge. `` I do not believe that Americans have to see the flag, that symbolizes their freedom to speak, devalued and cheapened in the cause of preserving that freedom.'' `` The act of flag burning is not meant to convey any political idea,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., who was among those introducing legislation to amend the Constitution to prohibit flag-desecration `` It is an act that is solely meant to provoke and offend.'' `` With this decision, the court cloaks the most offensive behavior as political expression,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON>, D-Va., who introduced a resolution aimed at nullifying the court decision Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Applegate </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, shouted on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>: `` I'm mad as hell. We've witnessed the greatest travesty in the annals of jurisprudence, when the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed the destruction of the greatest of American symbols. What in God's name is going on?'' Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> AuCoin </PERSON>, D-Ore., said he was `` deeply offended'' by the ruling `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> court has given us ... constitutional protection for the burning of Old Glory,'' he said. `` This liberal Democrat says, ` For shame!''' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., said he was disappointed with the ruling `` In my view, the American flag represents the pre-eminent symbol of our republic and all for which it stands,'' he said.

<HEAD>Chemical Industry Now Supports Toxics Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's chemical manufacturers said Thursday they have abandoned their previous opposition, and now support new legislation to control airborne toxic chemicals. `` We intend to be a constructive player in the legislative process,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forney </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executive, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> environment subcommittee on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Forney </PERSON> said the chemical industry's trade group previously believed new legislation was unnecessary, but has now concluded the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> `` can not adequately regulate air emissions under the existing law.'' But <PERSON> Forney </PERSON> and other industry witnesses clashed with Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON>, D-Calif., the subcommittee chairman, over the need for provisions designed to prevent accidental chemical releases <PERSON> Forney </PERSON> said `` a great deal has been done by industry'' to prevent accidents, and `` we do n't believe additional legislation is required.'' `` I find it difficult to understand that position,'' <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said, citing <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> figures showing there were more than 4,700 accidential releases between 1980 and 1987. The 120 most serious releases killed 145 people, injured more than 5,000, and caused nearly 250,000 to evacuate their homes, <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poje </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> said it is essential that any legislation include provisions to deal with chemical accidents such as the disaster in <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> in 1984. In that case, more than 3,000 people died when the rupture of a storage tank unleased deadly methyl isocyanate. Industrial facilities and communities `` are unprepared to understand and respond to the consequences of chemical accidents,'' he said, testifying for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>, representing environmental groups. One House bill, supported by <PERSON> Waxman </PERSON> and environmental groups, would require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to develop a list of substances most likely to endanger the public through accidental releases to the air and issue regulations to prevent such releases. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has recently disclosed that some 2.7 billion pounds of toxic substances go into the air each year, but the agency only regulates only seven of more than 200 chemicals that are released. According to the agency, some 360 million pounds involve suspected carcinogens, contributing to between 1,500 and 3,000 fatal cancers each year. Chemical emissions also are factors in respiratory disease and birth defects. A number of legislative proposals, including a clean air package unveiled this month by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, would force industry to use the best available technology to reduce emissions. The proposals would regulate either the chemicals themselves or set limits for industrial categories such as steel mills or pulp and paper. Industry witnesses told the subcommittee, however, many of the solutions proposed so far would be too harsh and should be changed. `` Improvement can be made by adopting provisions ... for reasonable technology'' instead of the best available, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yosie </PERSON>, vice president for health and environment of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group for the oil industry. The controls, he said should be placed only on `` those sources found to be significant emitters of toxic air pollutants.''

<HEAD>Witnesses Disagree on Permanent Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several witnesses who object to smoking urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday to extend and expand a no-smoking policy on short airline flights, but the tobacco industry insisted that health research does n't justify a ban. More than two dozen witnesses submitted testimony at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee hearing on several bills that would either make the temporary ban permanent or expand it to cover all flights. Smoking is outlawed on domestic flights of less than two hours, but the rule is to lapse in April 1990 unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> acts. Witnesses ranged from a flight attendant who said her health was ruined serving smoking passengers, to an indoor air expert who said there are worse health hazards _ including infectious disease _ in an airliner cabin than smoke. Opponents, including tobacco interests and some lawmakers, urged that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> await the results of a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study of the air aboard airliners before enacting any new law. The study is expected to be completed before the ban is lifted. `` Only a total ban on airline smoking will adequately protect the health and safety of airline passengers and flight crews,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., who is sponsoring legislation that would give <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a choice of making the ban permanent or expanding it to cover all commercial flights `` It is our job to esnure that those especially sensitive to cigarette smoke are free of having it foisted upon them in the confines of an airplane cabin,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION> Reps. <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, R-Ga., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, however, echoed the Tobacco industry's stand that no legislation should be passed before the airliner air quality study is completed `` I hope we will find a solution to this problem which will protect the rights of both those who choose to smoke and those who have decided not to do so,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Representatives of several anti-smoking groups, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Respiratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> and, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> called for a permanent ban of smoking on all flights, saying smoking poses a proven health hazard to nonsmoking passengers and crew as well as to smokers. Flight attendant <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert-Silva </PERSON> said working on flights where smoking was allowed severely affected her health. She complained of worsening sinus infections, bronchial problems, laryngitis, scratchy throat and blocked ears. `` A total ban will not cure me but I know I will not get worse and I can continue in the job I have grown to love without fear for my health,'' she said. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said a permanent ban would unjustly abandon any effort to accommodate smokers. He said studies show that a nonsmoking passenger would have to make eight continuous New York-to-Tokyo roundtrip flights before being exposed to the nicotine equivalent of a single cigarette. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, president of a company that specializes in fighting indoor air pollution, <ORGANIZATION> ACVA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said an airline passenger is more likely to get sick from bacteria, fungi and viruses floating in the poorly ventilated air tan from cigarette smoke. He said there is no scientific data to justify a smoking ban but took no position on the legislation. `` Ironically, there has been no evidence of excessive levels of carbon monoxide, airborne particulates or nicotine, all of which have been linked to tobacco smoke as a source,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. For 60 cents per passenger, ventilation can be increased to healthy levels on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. He recommended that the committee pass legislation requiring improved ventilation and filtration of air on planes with regular inspections and monitoring of air quality levels.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee approved an amendment in closed session Thursday seeking to save the V-22 Osprey aircraft by pumping $ 351 million of research and development funds into the program, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members said. The amendment was approved 11-7 by the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> research and development subcommittee, according to Reps. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON>, R-Pa., and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, D-Pa Sponsored by <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foglietta </PERSON>, the amendment was backed despite opposition by the subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, D-Calif., and by Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ala </LOCATION>., the panel's ranking Republican, according to <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> press aide <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, in overseeing cuts in the fiscal 1990 budget promised by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, announced in April that he was scuttling the V-22 program as too expensive. The V-22, described by the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> as its most important weapons program, is a revolutionary aircraft designed to take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane. <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> said the amendment would pull $ 351 million from research and development money initially earmarked for the B-2 bomber. He said he would soon introduce an amendment in the full committee to `` switch accounts,'' replenishing the B-2 research funds by taking the money from B-2 procurement. On Tuesday, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, urged <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> to suspend production of the B-2 because the aircraft has yet to undergo flight testing. The radar-evading aircraft is the most expensive plane in history. <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> made no predictions on whether his amendment would survive in the full committee. `` This is one battle in a continuing series of what is going to be a prolonged effort.

 An assailant in a pickup truck shot an elderly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nun in the head while she rode in another truck with two other nuns, a witness and authorities said Thursday. Sister <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON>, 73, was in serious condition with a bullet wound behind the left eye. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said she was conscious when he visited her at <LOCATION> Policlinica </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> at midday Thursday. The attack brought to mind one of the civil war's most well known cases of human rights abuses. The 1980 murders of four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> churchwomen by <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops provoked a temporary suspension of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Central American nation. But the motive in Wednesday evening's attack was not immediately known, and a robbery attempt was cited as one possibility. The shooting occurred 10 miles south of the capital outside <LOCATION> Zaragoza </LOCATION>, where Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON>, a registered nurse, worked at a home for orphans of the 9-year-old war between the government and leftist guerrillas. Extreme rightists and some armed forces officers consider nuns, priests and other churchpeople who work in poor communities sympathizers of the guerrillas. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> promised that the embassy will impress upon the Salvadoran government the need to find those responsible for the attack, embassy spokesman <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> said the embassy will provide any assistance requested, including medical evacuation. He said Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON> probably will be flown in coming days to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, headquarters of her order, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word. Corporal <PERSON> Asencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Mejia </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of the preliminary investigation, said the assailants and their vehicle had not been found. Sister <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON>, who was driving the pickup carrying Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON> and another nun, said she and her companions were approaching <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION> from the capital when a yellow pickup carrying at least six men _ four of them in the bed _ pulled alongside. `` They stayed alongside and pulled closer, and I did n't understand what was going on Then I heard a noise and thought they had bumped us. I did n't realize it was a bullet,'' she told reporters at the hospital. The single shot broke the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s passenger side window and entered Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON>'s skull. The Rev. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, founder of the orphanage, said doctors told him she probably will lose her left eye. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the attack probably was not political and could have been part of a robbery attempt. He said the attackers apparently were not members of the armed forces. `` There were at least six men in the truck and only one weapon,'' he said. `` They may have been thieves. Maybe they were drunk.'' Sister <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON> said she and her two companions had stopped at the bank before heading for <ORGANIZATION> Zaragoza </ORGANIZATION> but did not make a withdrawal. She said the other nun in the <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, Sister <PERSON> Juana </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, saw a man standing in the back of the yellow pickup fire the single pistol shot. Sister <PERSON> Brangan </PERSON> said she pulled to the shoulder and stopped, and the yellow pickup stopped ahead of her vehicle. When she started again, the attackers took off. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, 48, said neither he nor the sisters have been directly threatened but there are frequent insinuations they are leftist sympathizers. `` That kind of thing happens all the time because of the kind of work we do: the orphanage, bringing in medicine, a clinic for poor people,'' he said. Sister <PERSON> MacKey </PERSON> is a native of <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, and a naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen who has worked in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> since 1963 and in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> since 1983, according to <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> founded the orphanage where Sister <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON> works, the <ORGANIZATION> Oscar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arnulfo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Romero </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, the same year the four churchwomen were killed. It is named after the Salvadoran archbishop murdered by an extreme rightist gunman while saying Mass in March 1980. The orphanage is home to about 200 children left without family by the civil war. In the 1980 case, five National Guardsmen were convicted of murder and sentenced in 1984 to 30 years in prison. They had intercepted the vehicle carrying the three nuns and a lay worker who worked with refugees, taken them to a secluded spot and killed them with bullets fired into the head. Two of the four women were raped.

 Democratic lawmakers Thursday urged <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to reject any agreement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> that would require the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to maintain troops in that nation at current levels. `` Some of us on the committee think that no such assurance should be given,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-La </LOCATION>., told <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, who testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations defense subcommittee `` On the contrary, negotiations ought to begin for a phased withdrawal from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> said. Members of the panel cited a recent letter that <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sang-Hoon </PERSON> sent to <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> asking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to promise not to withdraw the more than 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed there. The minister told <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> national </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> committee </ORGANIZATION> that he would ask the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to sign a joint communique with that commitment when he travels here next month. <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON> and three other Democrats _ <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> _ wrote to <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> urging him to reject any preconditions for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop withdrawal. The senators said <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION>'s meeting next month with the Korean official would be an ideal opportunity to `` begin discussions on reducing our military presence in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spends $ 2.6 billion a year to maintain its troops in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON> said at the hearing that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s gross national product is seven times that of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, its population is twice that of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and it only spends 5 percent of its GNP on defense. `` I have become increasingly convinced that debate ought to begin about our presence in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has no plans to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but that cuts in troop levels are possible, `` just as there is a proposal to reduce our troop level in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> called last month for a reduction of the South Korea-based forces to 10,000

 <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> stole gold, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid and Japanese war reparations, took kickbacks and used an international network of cronies and banks in looting the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> of $ 5 billion, newly filed documents allege. The documents filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> here contain the most detailed charges yet against the deposed <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> leader and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, said plaintiff's attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olsen </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said Thursday the filing, which amended a 3-year-old lawsuit by the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government seeking $ 50 billion in damages from the Marcoses, was just a rehash of old allegations. He characterized Wednesday's action as a publicity stunt at a time when <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is near death. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was in very critical and unstable condition Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. `` It does n't make any sense to include old material at a time like this,'' <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> said. `` Everybody knows <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is likely to die in the near future.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from 1965 to 1986, and his wife plundered property and money by `` diverting foreign economic assistance to which the Philippine government was entitled, and extorting, soliciting and accepting bribes, kickbacks, illicit gratuities and commissions'' in exchange for favors, the amended lawsuit said. During that time, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> claimed average after-tax earnings of about $ 50,000 a year. Programs tapped by the Marcoses included the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Economic Support Fund, Japanese war reparations and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit also claims the Marcoses: _ Received more than $ 53 million in kickbacks on contracts with at least seven Japanese companies. _ In 1973 diverted to their personal use 800,000 troy ounces of gold from <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> reserves. _ Converted to their personal use more than $ 27 million from the <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and bought more than 52 million pesos worth of items at Philippine duty-free shops, thus avoiding substantial taxes. The lawsuit said that the couple, either by themselves or through others' help, maintained 58 bank accounts in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to shelter their gains. According to the lawsuit, the accounts were rarely in the name of the Marcoses, who operated behind `` nominees and surrogates or through multiple layers of offshore and onshore entities organized principally in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' The Marcoses have been hit with more than 40 lawsuits, including a criminal lawsuit filed by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and several cases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bartko </PERSON> contends there is only one significant lawsuit: the one in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` And, hopefully, it will be decided on the evidence,'' he said. The nine defendants in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> case include the Marcoses, Saudi Arabian millionaire <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Khashoggi </PERSON>, now living in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedicto </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> associate who is a fugitive from federal charges in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stemming from many of the same allegations outlined in this lawsuit. Other defendants are the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Redwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, which were allegedly controlled by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his associates; and three offshore companies, <ORGANIZATION> Krodos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> N.V. </ORGANIZATION>, of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antilles </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Al </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Djebel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Cayman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Lei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>.

 The prosecution said Thursday that a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldier who admits giving military secrets to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> handed communist officials information on how the Army would respond to an attack. A court martial is hearing the case of Spec. 4 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Niguel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, who changed his plea from not guilty to guilty of espionage in a surprise move at Wednesday's opening session. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> left the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION> late on Feb. 20, taking with him two computer discs containing classified information and a lap-top computer. He was found to be missing the next day. He returned voluntarily to his unit on March 4. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> told the court on Wednesday he went to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because he had problems at work and was frustrated with his job. `` I was never really sure what I was going to do at all,'' he was quoted as saying by the military's unofficial Stars and Stripes newspaper. `` I really did n't have a plan. ... Everything had been wrong. I was n't enjoying myself. I wanted to start over somewhere else.'' <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> could receive a maximum sentence of life in prison on the expionage charge. He faces lesser charges of absent without leave and wrongfully appropriating government property. Chief Prosecutor Maj. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> on Thursday sketched this sequence of events in connection with <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s absence: Late on Feb. 20, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> went to the regiment's intelligence office where he worked and removed a lap-top computer and two floppy discs containing classified information on the unit's general defense plans. The plans dealt with how the 11th Armored Cavalry, a front-line defense unit, would react in case of an attack from the Soviet bloc. The same day, <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> drove a military vehicle about 60 miles to a spot near the East German border. He abandoned the vehicle when it got stuck in a wooded area, walked to a border fence and climbed over it, carrying computer and discs. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> `` wandered around in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> for about two hours,'' then went to a communist border guard tower and turned himself over to the East Germans, later handing over computer and discs to unidentified East German officials in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The prosecutor said analysis later showed the computer `` had been accessed and set up to print out material'' _ meaning the East Germans had copied the information. <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> then went into detail on exchanges between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and East German officials after <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s abandoned vehicle was found on Feb. 24. He said the East Germans informed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on March 3 `` that they had released <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> to travel to a country of his choice,'' and that on the same day, the East Germans returned the computer and discs to <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, who traveled by train to <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` He stayed in one of the most expensive hotels in <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION>,'' on the night of March 3, and the next day began traveling by train for his home unit in <LOCATION> Fulda </LOCATION>, where he was later arrested, the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Peri </PERSON> sat quietly during the session, occasionally whispering to his chief defense counsel, Maj. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>. His parents, <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> and <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>, and sister <PERSON> Desiree </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, were also present and sat listening quietly. The court martial proceedings are slated to continue Friday with testimony from <PERSON> Peri </PERSON>'s military associates and medical experts who have examined him.

<HEAD>Showers And Thunderstorms Scattered Across The East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

 More rain fell across the already-soaked eastern third of the nation Thursday as residents coped with flooding from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell mainly from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to the middle <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and southern sections of the Great Lakes region. Flood or flash flood watches remained in effect for sections of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. In <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> McWherter </PERSON> requested federal disaster aid for <LOCATION> Rhea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, where $ 400,000 in damage to flooded homes and businesses was reported. Numerous recreation areas in the state were under water. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Authority </LOCATION> was hindered during the rain because it did not have its vast reservoir system drawn down, not surprising since this is the wettest June since <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> was created 56 years ago. Average June rainfall across the river valley has been 7.55 inches through Thursday morning, compared to a normal average of just under 3 inches for the entire month, <ORGANIZATION> TVA </ORGANIZATION> said. So far this year the valley has gotten 34.29 inches of rain, about 3 inches below rainfall for all of 1988 _ compared with an average of 26.58 through the end of the month in a normal year. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, floods have caused at least $ 2 million in damage to crops and homes, officials said Thursday. However, the rain has helped replenish <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s groundwater supplies, depleted by two straight years of drought. `` Over most of the state, the water levels have completely recovered from the drought we had last summer,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, director of the water division of the Geological Survey of <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>. Unofficial reports indicated 6 to nearly 7 inches of rain fell Thursday morning on eastern <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in parched southwestern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. `` The old ground sucked that up like you would n't believe. It had n't seen it in a while, and it took advantage of it,'' said <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meggison </PERSON>. Reports of a dousing in western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> apparently convinced commodity traders that severely dry conditions there were easing, and corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Along the Licking River in central <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, two families were evacuated at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> when the water reached its 17-foot flood stage. At <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, firefighters and volunteers piled up sandbags on the south side of the city in an attempt to hold back the river, authorities said. Storms also raised several rivers in southeastern <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> above flood stage Thursday, authorities said. In addition, a number of arriving and departing morning flights at <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> Metropolitan Airport were delayed by dense fog, air traffic manager <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Linton </PERSON> said. Elsewhere, there were showers over eastern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> western <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, and western and central <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. Low-temperature records for the date were set in Casper, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, where it was 34 degrees; <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, 35; <LOCATION> Rapid </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, 39; <LOCATION> Scottsbluff </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, 38; and <LOCATION> Winslow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, 45. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52 degrees at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, to 105 at <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 27 degrees at <LOCATION> Craig </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>. Friday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms across much of the nation east of the <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>, with thunderstorms especially from southern <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, and in the upper <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, and showers most numerous from northeastern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to upper <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and northern lower Showers also were forecast over the northern Rockies, with showers most numerous in western <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Highs only in the 60s were predicted in the northern <LOCATION> Rockies </LOCATION>; in the 60s and 70s in southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, along much of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, and across the northern and central high Plains to upper <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>; above 90 across <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, and from the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the valleys and deserts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; and above 100 in the desert <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is continuing to seek increased aid to non-communist rebels in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Thursday, asking congressional critics not to be `` paralyzed by a memory'' of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a transitional government in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> with `` a key role'' by opposition leaders Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, the former ruler of the country, and <LOCATION> Son </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sann </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in remarks to the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials have acknowledged slim chances of getting new aid through <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> where some members are concerned that the aid could fall into the hands of the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. But the vice president said that beefing up aid to the non-communist forces to try to influence what will happen after the impending departure of the occupying Vietnamese would reduce the chances of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> returning top power. `` By doing nothing, we would increase the likelihood of continued civil war and the potential for a return to power by the murderous <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` The unacknowledged but all-too-tangible presence in the debate over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> is the ghost of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. But, my friends, it is now time to lay this ghost to rest,'' he said. `` No great nation can long afford to be paralyzed by a memory. We must not permit the non-communist resistance in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to becoemthe last casualty of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war.'' On the other hand, the vice president said, `` We have learned that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not fight others' battles for them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> gained notoriety for the brutality of their regime from 1973 to 1978 when more than 1 million people died under leader <PERSON> Pol </PERSON> <PERSON> Pot </PERSON>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has said that it would be a fact of life that the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, the strongest of the current insurgent groups, would have a role in a future Cambodian government. Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, is pushing an effort in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to boost military aid for the non-communists from the current $ 7 million a year to as much as $ 30 million.

 A man who taped his brother's arrest won a recommendation for disciplinary action against one of the policemen involved, but faces felony charges of illegally recording the incident. The charges stem from the March 15 arrest of <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> on a federal drug charge in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, according to a June 14 report to Police Chief <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLane </PERSON> by the police department's internal affairs division. Two of the suspect's brothers began arguing with a policeman. One, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON>, feared violence and switched on a tape recorder apparently concealed in a bag he was carrying, the report said. After Officer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaratch </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> for identification, he argued with the other brother, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yaratch </PERSON> then forced <PERSON> Renee </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> down on a car and handcuffed <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yaratch </PERSON> yelled expletives at the man, then requested identification from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON>, the report said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> `` made an aggressive move'' toward the officer, who grabbed the man's arm and forced him against a car, the report said. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> later played the tape for the officer's superiors. The report recommended disciplinary action against <PERSON> Yaratch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> was arrested March 25 on two felony counts of illegally recording a conversation, and released from the Hillsborough County Jail. Except in criminal investigations, it generally is illegal in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to tape-record conversations between two people without both parties' consent. If convicted on both counts, <PERSON> Myles </PERSON> faces up to 10 years in prison and $ 10,000 in fines. The state attorney's office said the matter is still under investigation. The internal investigation of <LOCATION> Yaratch </LOCATION> is completed, but a decision on possible disciplinary action against him is pending, officials said.

<TEXT>
 The leader of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s conservative party demanded Thursday that <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> resign as the interim premier because of a new banking scandal, the latest to occur under <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s socialist government. <PERSON> Papandeou </PERSON> later was admitted to a hospital, and doctors said he had an infection of the respiratory system. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, 70, who underwent triple bypass heart surgery in September, was reported in excellent condition after he entered the General State hospital. Doctors said the prime minister would spend the night at the hospital, but that his illness `` does not prevent execution of his duties.'' <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> party has until Friday to form a coalition, said <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was `` responsible and guilty'' in the scandal involving the state-owned <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials allege the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> operated illegally in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and helped people avoid taxes and get around bank reporting laws. It is accused of laundering at least $ 700 million. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday that 13 employees and executives of the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> had been arrested. There were no allegations of wrongdoing against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks. `` These usurpers of power who shame <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and rob the <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> people must leave immediately ... it's vital that a new government is formed now,'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> told a news conference. New Democracy emerged the winner of Sunday's general elections with 145 seats in the 300-seat unicameral <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but fell short of an absolute majority necessary to form a government. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION>, won 125 seats, failing to win a third consecutive four-year term. The Coalition of the Left and Progress, an alliance of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the small Eurocommunist Left, won 28 seats. On Tuesday, President <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Sartzetakis </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> three days to form a government. If he fails, the other two major parties will have a chance to form a coalition. If there is no government by July 3, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> will be dissolved and a caretaker government will be formed by the president to prepare for new elections. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said a caretaker government should be formed immediately and that elections should be held no later than September, because <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> `` will do his utmost to cover up `` the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> scandal. The scandal gave <PERSON> Papandeou </PERSON>'s political opponents new ammunition since it took place during his socialist administration's tenure in office. Ranking executives in state-controlled institutions are traditionally appointed by the government in power at the time.

 New regulations to protect the public from contaminated drinking water may prevent 90,000 cases of water-borne diseases every year but will mean higher water bills for millions of Americans, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The agency announced final regulations that will require nearly 10,000 providers of drinking water, serving an estimated 150 million people, to comply with strict filtration requirements to rid the water of disease-causing germs. The regulations, which apply to communities where drinking water comes from surface sources such as rivers and streams, are aimed at reducing the risk of illness from a variety of microscopic organisms such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa. The new regulations require that these public water systems use disinfectants of prescribed performance, and those not meeting certain strict purity standards must be treated by filtration. If not, states must devise another way to eliminate the germs, such as additional chemicals. Maximum concentrations are established for some microorganisms and treatment techniques are required for others. The rules also specify that treatment plant operators meet state qualifications and they set up new monitoring and reporting requirements. The agency has estimated that tens of thousands of people become ill yearly from such contamination. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated the more stringent water purification procedures are likely to prevent annually about 90,000 illnesses, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and stomach upsets. `` These rules are a major step forward in providing maximum protection for our nation's drinking-water supplies,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said the new requirements also will be expensive with expected initial capital costs at about $ 3 billion and operational costs of about $ 500 million a year. The agency said the additional costs are expected to be passed onto customers, but the increase in household water bills is likely to vary widely depending on the size of the public water system and whether the system already has some filtration equipment. According to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, in rural areas where water systems serve fewer than 500 customers and where no filtration is now used, household water bills could increase from $ 30 to $ 50 a month. In urban areas with more customers to bear the cost, the increase is likely to be about $ 6 a month, perhaps much less if some filtration equipment already is being used. About one-third of the nearly 10,000 water systems subject to the tighter requirements currently have no filtration system, the agency said. Those systems serve more than 21 million people, including residents of major cities such as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Some other cities not filtering their drinking water are <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Syracuse </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. Local authorities have four years in which to install new equipment, said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>

 A jury was selected Thursday in the trial of two former aides to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> after a day that included such questions as whether they recognized <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION> and other luxury brand names. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, 32, and his older brother and housemate, <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 35, are accused of not paying $ 494,000 in income taxes from 1983 to 1987. They also are charged with using more than $ 1.1 million of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to pay personal bills, including $ 55,000 in purchases from the Cartier jewelry store in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A jury of eight women and four men was selected to hear the Taggarts' trial, which is scheduled to begin July 5 and is expected to take about a month. Four alternate jurors also were picked. The Taggarts' trial will be a prelude to the August trial of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON>. The two former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leaders are accused of diverting more than $ 4 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money for their own benefit. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> went to work at <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in 1978 when he was 21 as an administrative assistant to the television ministry's music director. The young piano player soon became <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s most trusted aide, and perhaps <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s second most powerful executive. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> records, drew more than $ 620,000 in pay in the 15 months ending March 1987 _ the same month <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> resigned in a sex and money scandal. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON> _ then <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s interior decorator _ received nearly $ 300,000 during that period <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> asked some potential jurors if they regularly contributed to a church or a religious organization. He also asked if they were familiar with certain brand names such as <ORGANIZATION> Gucci </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cartier </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benz </ORGANIZATION>. He then asked if they buy most of their clothing and jewelry in discount stores or expensive shops and if they normally pay with cash, credit cards or checks. It was not known whether any prospective jurors were excluded on the basis of their answers to the questions. The Taggarts' wardrobes included mink coats, designer clothes and expensive jewelry. They bought a $ 660,000 condominium on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Fifth Avenue and a $ 317,000 two-story stucco house in southeast <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION> For Christmas in 1986, they gave each other black <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> cars worth $ 87,765. Federal prosecutors are trying to prove the Taggarts conspired to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> by using <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> credit cards to get cash advances, ranging from $ 5,000 to $ 25,000, and then using the money to pay personal bills. The Taggarts also are accused of using blank PTL checks to pay off their <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> bills. One check was for $ 50,000, another for $ 45,000, the indictment said.

 A man whose 10-year-old daughter accused him of sexually abusing her and whose ex-wife went to prison to keep her hidden was awarded legal custody of the child, touching off a protest by angry women Thursday. The ruling by a probate judge granted joint physical custody of <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON>, effective July 9. The girl will be with her father four days a week and with her mother the rest of the time. But <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> won sole legal custody, giving him the power to determine such matters as where <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> attends school and her day-to-day care. About 50 women gathered outside the Statehouse on Thursday afternoon to protest Wednesday's decision. Many work at rape crisis centers, while others were victims of rape or incest, said <PERSON> Dede </PERSON> <PERSON> Ketover </PERSON>, a rally organizer. `` I'm here because the judge put out a very clear message that tells kids, ` If you've been molested, do n't talk about it because no one's going to believe you,' and that tells mothers that if you're going to fight for your kids you're going to lose,'' <PERSON> Ketover </PERSON> said `` The courts ca n't protect these kids.'' `` The system has failed <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a counselor at the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rape </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said earlier. `` They have left open the possibility of sexual abuse after all this trauma. <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> has gotten nowhere.'' But <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Probate Judge <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> ruled the evidence did not prove that <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> sexually abused and threatened <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON>. The judge, describing <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> as intelligent and eager to please her parents, noted that the child vacillated in her story and recanted more than once. `` Under these circumstances, the court can not simply take the child's word as the truth since the court would be in the untenable position of having to arbitrarily select one of the child's versions over another,'' Ms. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, the fact tha <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> has wavered in her allegations does not automatically preclude the veracity of those allegations,'' she said. The judge also ordered that <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> continue receiving psychotherapy. Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON>, said the decision would be appealed. She said her client was `` very concerned about her daughter's welfare and safety.'' <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> was elated by the ruling, said his attorney, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DiGangi </PERSON>. The LaLondes began fighting over their daughter's custody in a closed trial that began May 1988 in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> before <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>. Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> and her daughter claimed the child had been abused by <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON>, who denied the accusation. The LaLondes divorced in 1983. Three years later, Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> accused her ex-husband of abusing their child during visits. Another probate judge ruled the charges were unfounded. Rather than see <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> gain custody, mother and child fled the state in June 1986 and settled in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In March 1987, Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> alone. After Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> refused to say where <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> was, a judge ordered her imprisoned until she revealed the child's location. She spent six months in state prison. Ms. <PERSON> LaLonde </PERSON> was freed only after a baby sitter in <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, tipped police that the child was being sheltered by an underground network of women. <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> was brought back to the state in October 1987, and was placed by the state with a foster family. Ms. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON> said Wednesday that the child still faces considerable difficulties. `` Nicole will, in all likelihood, spend her forseeable future in therapy attempting to understand her traumatic past and make some sort of peace with parents who can not cooperate,'' the judge said.

 Authorities on Thursday formally charged six Lebanese men with conspiring to assassinate Lebanese Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The six were arrested in the southern port of <LOCATION> Larnaca </LOCATION> last month after scuba divers stumbled across two shoulder-fired SA-7 anti-aircraft missiles hidden underwater near the coastal airport. The missiles lacked only their firing pins, which were discovered along with a cache of weapons in a seaside apartment where most of the men were arrested. The weapons included five Kalashnikov rifles, 17 magazines and 28 hand grenades. In addition to the conspiracy charge, they face seven other charges including illegal weapons possession. Five of the men are accused of illegally entering <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rare Corporate Manslaughter Charge Over Ferry Sinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A court issued manslaughter summonses Thursday for a shipping company, three of its former directors and four seamen over the 1987 <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> ferry disaster in which 193 people died. A corporate manslaughter conviction can carry an unlimited fine, while the seven men face a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The decision to prosecute P and O European Ferries was believed by experts to be unprecedented. It capped more than two years of court and police proceedings, a public inquiry that blamed the ship owners, and an inquest that returned a verdict of unlawful killing. There was no immediate comment from the ferry company or the men summoned. The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>, a car-and-passenger ferry, capsized outside the Belgian port of <LOCATION> Zeebrugge </LOCATION> in March 1987. Lawyers have disclosed that about two-thirds of the families affected by the disaster have accepted a compensation package from P and O, from $ 7,700 to the six-figure range, depending on the family's circumstances and the contribution the victim made to the family's income. Published reports have estimated the final payout will be at least $ 6 million and as much as $ 23 million. An unidentified family that lost its breadwinner father was granted $ 294,000 in a test case compensation settlement in the High Court in January 1988. Facing prosecution are the ship's captain, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewry </PERSON>; First Officer <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabel </PERSON>; Senior Master <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Boatswain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>. Also summoned were <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Develine </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcindore </PERSON>, directors of owner <ORGANIZATION> Townsend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which is now called P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION>. The corporate manslaughter charge is against P and <ORGANIZATION> O </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION>. The men summoned must appear before magistrates Aug. 1. The trial is expected to begin next year. `` It's a pretty untested part of the law,'' said a spokeswoman for the Crown Prosecution Service, which obtained the summonses at <ORGANIZATION> Bow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The spokeswoman, commenting on condition of anonymity, said that except for a couple of cases in the 1920s, the state had never brought a charge of this sort against a company. `` It's a complicated question because it is absolutely unprecedented for this sort of case to go ahead,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Zander </PERSON>, professor of law at the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohan </PERSON>, head of an association of families of the disaster victims, welcomed the move, as did the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s transport spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>. `` It makes clear to all directors of companies that they have corporate responsibility to see that the highest levels of safety pertain in their areas of operation and they do n't just blame the workers,'' he said. The ship with an estimated 543 people aboard capsized because its bow doors were open, letting in water that destabilized it, a public inquiry concluded. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, who allegedly left the doors open, was directly blamed, while <PERSON> Lewry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sabel </PERSON> were accused of serious negligence. Of <ORGANIZATION> Townsend </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the inquiry report said: `` From top to bottom, the body corporate was affected by the disease of sloppiness,'' and guilt rested with `` all concerned in management.'' An inquest jury returned a verdict of unlawful killing, and police conducted a lengthy investigation. Last year, in an action brought by the families, a court ruled that companies could be prosecuted for manslaughter.

<HEAD>18 Percent of Doctors Deny Some Care Due to Malpractice Fears</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The fear of malpractice lawsuits is leading some doctors to turn away high-risk patients, a new Gallup poll shows. Fourteen percent of the 1,004 doctors surveyed nationwide said they had denied service to as many as 10 high-risk patients in the past year because of such fears, while 4 percent said they'd refused to treat more than 10. More than three-fourths of the doctors polled _ 76 percent _ said they did n't turn away any patients for fear of litigation. However, 35 percent said there are forms of medicine they do n't practice, despite being qualified, because of high liability insurance costs Thirty-nine percent of those surveyed said they believe indigent patients are more likely than other patients to sue for malpractice, but 22 percent said poor patients are less likely to sue. In a separate survey of public opinion, 48 percent of 1,500 adults polled said they believe `` people who sue physicians for malpractice are just looking for an easy way to make money.'' The results of the two surveys are published in Friday's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, the weekly newspaper of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president, said the results were troubling. `` I believe it is a critical comment on the state of our legal system that even one patient would not receive care because physicians feared being sued,'' <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> told the publication. `` All of these factors _ declining high-risk patients, limiting their type of practice, and believing indigent patients are more likely to sue'' affect the public's ability to receive medical care, he said. `` An even more damning indictment of our legal system is that almost half of the public surveyed believe that people are just looking for an easy way to make money,'' he said. The Gallup Organization conducted both polls. In the physicians' poll, the 1,004 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> doctors were chosen at random and contacted by telephone from Jan. 19 through Feb. 8. The margin of error was 3.5 percentage points, meaning answers could vary by 3.5 percentage points either way. The public poll involved telephone interviews of 1,500 randomly selected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents aged 18 and above during the last week of January and the first week of February. The margin of error was 2.5 percentage points. The question about denying service to high-risk patients did not define `` high-risk.'' Dr. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hastings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a medical-ethics think tank near <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said some doctors might consider the term to mean `` likely to sue,'' but most would probably define it as medically risky, such as a case of a diabetic pregnant woman with high blood pressure. In many such cases, it may be best for the patient if the doctor refers the case to another physician because of possible complications, the pediatrician and ethicist said.

 President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> of Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> shook hands Thursday and agreed to end 14 years of civil war, reports said. The accord came at the end of an African summit on <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> attended by 14 African heads of state. It provides for a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> to start at midnight Friday -LRB- 7 p.m. Friday EDT -RRB-, according to Zairian officials quoted by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> news agency Agence France-Presse. The meeting between <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was their first since the civil war began in 1975. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> heads the U.S.-backed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>. The reconciliation follows a U.S.-brokered regional peace accord signed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December under which <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> agreed to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and halt aid to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s rebels in exchange for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops backing <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' government. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> signed the accord. The rebels are not party to the agreement. Thursday's peace announcement was called the Declaration of <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, after the town in northern <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> where the summit was held. It is the hometown of President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> Sese Soko of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and lies 700 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, the capital. A commission headed by <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> is to be established to bring about national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. The historic handshake followed five hours of delay during which hard talks took place, Zairian officials were quoted as saying. President <PERSON> Moussa </PERSON> <PERSON> Traore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mali </LOCATION>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, which held the summit, was quoted as saying in a closing speech that a new page had been turned in African history: `` This brotherly handshake between Dr. <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and President <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> symbolizes the end of civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, which will open up a new era ... devoted to economic and social development.'' Reports said a snag developed until <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed to remain in his bush headquarters until elections, expected to be held in two years. Earlier, he had refused to go into exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We can now give <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> hope for peace, unity and development,'' <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said, according to the official <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> LUSA </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, 19 members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday urged <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> to negotiate wtih the rebels `` as the only means to end the tragic civil war in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Kaunda </PERSON> said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> promised at the meeting to abide by a previous agreement to remain out of peace negotiations, according to <ORGANIZATION> LUSA </ORGANIZATION>. That agreement broke a deadlock and brought <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government to the conference table. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed in May he would not demand a role in any transitional government on condition democratic elections are held within two years. Major obstacles included <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' insistence on maintaining one-party rule while offering the rebels some positions in his administration. The government offered rebels an amnesty and clemency, but the guerrillas replied that the offer suggested their war was criminal and so was unacceptable. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> garners most of his support from the rural southern area toward <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> _ the <LOCATION> Ovimbundu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> tribe </LOCATION>, the biggest in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, and the Ovambo. <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>' power base is around northern <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, but his followers are more diverse, coming from several smaller tribes. <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> arrived ready to reconcile. Before leaving <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> earlier Thursday, he commuted death sentences of 50 rebels condemned for high treason and terrorism between 1981-87, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> ANGOP </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. On Wednesday, it said, the government released 700 rebel prisoners who accepted an amnesty. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s guerrillas, armed by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, have been fighting to share power with <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>'s Cuban-backed government since Angolan independence. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> continues to arm the rebels and may have encouraged the rebels to negotiate. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, said from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` helped develop'' the <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> summit. `` We may have a breakthrough,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> forecast earlier Thursday. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is twice the size of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with 481,354 square miles, but has only 8 million people. Most of them live in tribal villages and rural areas. Nearly all the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> fled in 1975, leaving <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> more than 90 percent illiterate and badly in need of capital and skilled workers. Oil fields in the Angolan enclave of <LOCATION> Cabinda </LOCATION> supply more than 90 percent of the nation's export earnings. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> also has diamonds, minerals and rich agricultural land, but the civil war has seriously disrupted the economy.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday more than 100 people in <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> have been arrested since an attempted coup in April and may face torture and illegal execution. The human rights group said the detainees `` seem to have been arrested arbitrarily because of their ethnic origin and their family connections with other government opponents.'' An Amnesty statement said all detainees were of the <ORGANIZATION> Zaghawa </ORGANIZATION> ethnic group, which comes from the northeast portion of the former French colony, and that the <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> government has disclosed nothing about them. `` <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> has received reports of both torture and extra-judicial executions of suspected government opponents at secret detention centers in <LOCATION> N'djamena </LOCATION> -LRB- the capital -RRB-,'' the statement said. Amnesty said it is `` therefore concerned, both that these detainees may be subjected to torture and that their lives may be in danger.'' It named six of them, all brothers of <PERSON> Sidik </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadoul </PERSON>, former head of military police in a coalition that governed <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> from 1979 to 1982. It said <PERSON> Fadoul </PERSON> was arrested in 1988 when he returned voluntarily to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION>, having been personally assured by President <PERSON> Hissene </PERSON> <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> that he would not be persecuted. It identified the brothers as Professor <PERSON> Zakaria </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadoul </PERSON>, head of the linguistics department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chad </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadoul </PERSON>, a bank employee; <PERSON> Mahamat </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadoul </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chad </ORGANIZATION> journalist; <PERSON> Mahamat </PERSON> <PERSON> Den </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadoul </PERSON>, a driver; and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yacoub </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadoul </PERSON>, both merchants.

According to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> authorities, the coup attempt was made on April 1 and was led by Interior Minister <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahamat </PERSON> <PERSON> Itno </PERSON>, armed forces chief <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Djamous </PERSON> and his predecessor, <PERSON> Idriss </PERSON> <PERSON> Debi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> consider <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> strategic because of its position between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and between <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has sent troops to <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> twice since 1983 to head off <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> incursions. <PERSON> Habre </PERSON> has been president since 1982, when he ousted a Libyan-backed government led by <PERSON> Goukouni </PERSON> <PERSON> Oueddei </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Chad </LOCATION> gained its independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1960.

<TEXT>
 The Wall Street Journal, the nation's first national newspaper and a fixture in corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, began life 100 years ago as a 2-cent broadsheet hand-delivered in lower <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s business district to a few hundred readers. As it celebrates its centennial with a special edition Friday, the Journal can boast a readership of 2 million, making it the nation's largest newspaper, and a reputation as the daily diary of capitalism. `` It's given us a common language with regard to how we look at everything from markets to international trade,'' observed <PERSON> Everette </PERSON> <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. But even as the paper has grown and adjusted to the modern world _ adding graphics and extra feature sections _ its virtual monopoly on financial news eroded in recent years. A series of birthday bashes held this week can not obscure the challenges the paper faces as it heads into its second century: Circulation has slipped, advertising revenue is down and new competition has emerged for both readers and ad dollars. `` It still is by far the strongest and most profitable newspaper franchise in the country,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, a media industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` But it's not as strong and not as profitable as it used to be.'' Advertising linage peaked in 1983 and has fallen by 7.5 percent since, according to the Journal's figures. Circulation hit a high of 2.1 million at the end of 1983, but since then dropped to about 1.95 million. Also in the last few years, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> launched a national edition, <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> had its nationwide rollout and most metropolitan newspapers beefed up their business coverage, as did the broadcast networks and cable television. Most of the ad decline stemmed from advertising cutbacks by banks and financial institutions _ the <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest source of ads, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Burenga </PERSON>, general manager of the Journal and its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc.. Financial advertising began to slip long before the stock market crash of October 1987, due to Wall Street mergers that reduced the number of investment houses, <PERSON> Burenga </PERSON> Circulation was crimped by a reduction in the number of middle managers and executives _ the paper's prime readers _ in the wave of mergers, takeovers and corporate restructurings of the 1980s, <PERSON> Burenga </PERSON> said. The Journal struck back by adding a third section last fall and starting special columns on real estate, media, marketing, law, technology and other topics. It also upgraded its coverage of the arts. Some have questioned whether this expansion has weakened the Journal's focus. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlstine </PERSON>, the Journal's managing editor, disagrees. `` We've always felt that while we are a business newspaper, that our readers have interests in more than just business,'' he said. <PERSON> Pearlstine </PERSON> views the broader coverage as another step in the Journal's evolution from a paper serving Wall Street traders to a national daily. The Journal began on July 8, 1889, as a four-page afternoon paper. The first edition included brief reports on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> stock exchanges and numerous items on railroad companies, then a major force in American business. Much of the shape of today's Journal is the work of the late <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> `` Barney'' <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>, the newspaper's legendary former managing editor who began his 38-year Journal career in 1929. Under <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON>, the paper launched its trademark front-page feature stories _ called leaders _ and its in-depth reports, along with stories about trends and issues shaping the business world and society. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> stressed that business stories need not be written in the arcane language of business. `` Do n't write banking stories for bankers,'' he told reporters. `` Write for the banks' customers.'' The Journal is unusual in many ways: Although it has run an occasional photograph, it prefers to illustrate stories with drawings, and it is one of the few big papers to eschew the color explosion. Its front-page design of six vertical columns is virtually cast in stone. Notable exceptions were on Oct. 20, 1987, the day after the Black Monday stock market crash, and the day after the Japanese attacked <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pearlstine </PERSON> says highlights of his 20 years at the paper include the two Pulitzer Prizes the Journal won last year, increasing to 13 the number of Pulitzers it has been awarded. The nadir, he said, was the scandal involving former <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Winans </PERSON>, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 1985 for securities fraud. <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> was convicted of tipping stock traders to the contents of the Wall Street column he wrote for the paper before it appeared in print. In exchange, <PERSON> Winans </PERSON> received a share of any profit they made from market-affecting news. <PERSON> Pearlstine </PERSON> credited the Journal's thorough coverage of the scandal for restoring the paper's credibility. Journal executives and industry analysts say the Journal's circulation and advertising setbacks are temporary `` They've had these kinds of problems before, and once the advertising economy gets through these things, the Journal will once more prosper,'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>.

 A plane carrying 60 people slammed into a mountain in the Andes, reportedly splitting in half, and all aboard were killed, the air force said Thursday. The aircraft, an air force plane, crashed near the town of <LOCATION> Tarma </LOCATION> 100 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> Wednesday, according to a communique. Earlier Thursday, Gen. <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullca </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, police chief of <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION> city in the central highlands, said the plane was carrying 42 people, including crew and passengers. Peasants from <LOCATION> Uyubamba </LOCATION> village said they watched the aircraft break into two from the eastern mountain slopes, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. The communique said 42 of the victims had been identified. An air force spokesman said no foreigners were among the passengers. The air force did not say how many of the dead were civilians and how many were military personnel. The communique did not indicate what might have caused the crash. The aircraft, a Canadian-made <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> bimotor cargo plane converted to passenger service, left the jungle town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ramon </LOCATION>, 126 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The air force provides passenger service on its planes to remote towns in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s eastern <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle because the routes are not profitable for civilian airlines. Also Wednesday, an Aeroperu jetliner made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>'s international airport on a flight from <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>. Airport officials said the landing gear on the plane, a DC-8, would not come down. The aircraft circled the airport for more than an hour, consuming its remaining fuel to reduce the chances of fire during the emergency landing. The aircraft finally was able to land without any of the 148 passengers suffering injuries. Aeroperu is a government-owned airline. Six civilian and military planes have crashed in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in the past two years. Critics blame most accidents on poor maintenance because of a shortage of spare parts. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is suffering its worst recession in history, weighed down by annual inflation of more than 5,000 percent.

<HEAD>Solidarity Citizens Committee To Focus on Building Union</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which ran the union's campaign for the new parliament, decided Thursday not to disband now that elections are over, patching a dispute that threated to split the opposition. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the union's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> advocated closing the local <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> so that activists nationwide could concentrate on rebuilding the Solidarity trade union itself. But activists strongly disagreed, and after a daylong debtate passed two vaguely worded resolutions that Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said meant local groups could continue to exist for now. About 120 members of the national <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ set up in December by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to advise the union on political, social and economic issues _ gathered in a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> auditorium for the debate. During the debate, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> defended a weekend resolution by the union's <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to concentrate efforts on rebuilding the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade union, which regained legal status April 17. Union organizing took a back seat during the election campaign. But the final resolution thanked the local Citizens Committees, which helped Solidarity to its overwhelming election victory, and said they should help prepare for free municipal elections, a Solidarity goal. The executive's resolution to dissolve the local committees `` should not be treated as something that should be implemented immediately,'' <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said. `` Today's resolution ... says one should approach their transformation with flexibility,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is of the opinion that the main task at the present moment is expanding and strengthening the Solidarity trade union and Farmers Solidarity as guarantors of democratic reforms in our country,'' it said. A 14-member commission was appointed to present proposals on the future of the national <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by Sept. 10. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appeared concerned the continued existence of the committees would drain strength from rebuilding the union. `` Today if we get divided into two ... we weaken the most important stream and the most important stream today is the broad stream of working people,'' he said. A top adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> who opposed disbanding the committees tried to downplay conflict. `` First of all we want to say in the current situation that we maintain unity, that we are able to maintain it and that there is no conflict between the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the bodies of the union,'' said <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>. The weekend decision was greeted with anger from members of the local committees, flush with their electoral triumph, which saw Solidarity win 99 of of 100 seats in the freely contested <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in June 4 and June 18 elections. Solidarity also won all seats available to it in the lower house, the Sejm. Critics said the decision was to prevent the committees in each of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 49 provinces from becoming parallel, possibly rival organizations to Solidarity. The dispute reflected contradictions within Solidarity over whether it is ultimately a trade union or a political movement and whether it will be led by workers or intellectuals. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said Solidarity should be mainly a union, with politics eventually shifted to newly emerging political groups. But Solidarity nevertheless has a broad following among non-workers _ students, intellectuals and professionals _ who are more interested in pressing communist authorities for democratic political changes.

 Four workers in a disciplinary program for ghetto children received maximum 20-year sentences Thursday for beating their leader's 8-year-old daughter to death. <ORGANIZATION> Ecclesia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Eldridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, making his first appearance in court during the trial, pleaded unsuccessfully for the release of the four pending an appeal. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, 35, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, 28, and <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 38, all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, were convicted of first-degree manslaughter May 12 in the death of <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> endured hundreds of blows for stealing food from another child Oct. 13, according to testimony. Several children forced to witness the discipline session testified that <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> was slammed against a wall, kicked, tripped, slapped, dropped on the floor, shoved, bitten, spit upon and hung out a window. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who beat five other Ecclesia children with an electrical cord, was convicted June 5 of five counts each of second-degree assault and first-degree criminal mistreatment. <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Circuit Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to 10 years in prison, to be served after the manslaughter sentence, on that conviction. She will be eligible for parole in seven years. Defense lawyers asked that their clients receive light sentences since none had criminal records. But prosecutor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> urged the maximum penalty for all four. Chambers, who got the stiffest penalty of the four, will be eligible for parole in 10 years. The 50 or more blows dealt by Chambers were mainly to blame for the girl's death, <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said. Chambers described <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> during the trial as `` a strong-willed, strong-bodied world-class athlete,'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> recalled. `` But she was not yet a world-class athlete. She was an 8-year-old girl.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was convicted of striking and biting <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>. `` It took more guts for <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> to bite you in the leg than for a prisoner of war to spit in the face of her captors,'' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> told her. <PERSON> Brinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doolittle </PERSON>, who held the girl down, will each have to serve 40 months before being eligible for parole. `` No human being could have participated without asking, ` Has n't this gone far enough?' <PERSON> Lowe </PERSON> said of the two. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> said the sentences will be appealed. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, who testified under a 1987 law that allows crime victims or their families to speak at sentencing, broke down once during his rambling, 20-minute testimony. `` I'm walking a tightrope,'' he explained to the court. `` When I do n't show any emotion, I'm inhuman,'' <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- When I do express my feelings -RRB-, people think I'm faking. I would like to assure you my daughter's loss is serious to me.'' He declined to comment after the sentencing. <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON>, 35, formed Ecclesia in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' tough <LOCATION> Watts </LOCATION> area to steer ghetto children away from drugs and crime and toward rigorous athletic training. He criticized the news media Thursday for calling his organization a cult, and portraying him as `` a madman or someone who does n't have any sense.'' <PERSON> Broussard </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> at the time of the beating at a farmhouse east of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. He has denied all along that <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON> was beaten, saying that children in the group were spanked as part of the group's strict disciplinary policy. Fifty-three children 6 weeks to 16 years old were taken into state protective custody after <PERSON> Dayna </PERSON>'s death. They are living with foster parents or with relatives.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued a strong personal dissent Thursday to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision overturning flag-desecration laws, declaring that `` flag burning is wrong, dead wrong.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who made the flag a major issue in his 1988 campaign, commented as he unveiled a nationwide volunteer program and asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to appropriate $ 100 million for it over the next four years. Meanwhile, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the administration's response to the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We feel the administration has spoken out loudly, strongly and without reservation on this issue,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` We've spoken out forcefully, more than any other country in the world.'' The president also met with homeless youths in a center near <LOCATION> Times </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where one young woman told him the minimum wage was so low that it was more profitable to sell drugs. `` It's hard to get good jobs,'' a 20-year-old Covenant House resident identified only as <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> said, suggesting that it was more profitable to sell drugs. `` Working in McDonald's _ at the minimum wage _ it just does n't pay.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed a bill that would have raised the minimum wage from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.55, saying that figure was too high. In a speech to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> business and community leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> departed from his prepared text on the volunteerism program to comment on Wednesday's 5-4 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. He stopped short of directly criticizing the court, saying he understood the legal basis of the decision. `` But, I have to give you my personal, emotional response,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Flag burning is wrong, dead wrong.'' He was applauded vigorously by the luncheon crowd of about 1,000 when he concluded: `` The flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is very, very special.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> frequently symbolically wrapped himself in the flag during last year's campaign, even giving a speech outside a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> flag factory. He repeatedly attacked his Democratic opponent, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for having vetoed a school pledge of allegiance law. The court's decision restricts the power of states to punish those who burn or otherwise desecrate an American flag. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> borrowed from another campaign theme, his `` thousand points of light,'' in continuing to trumpet the theme of volunteerism he has heralded all week. He announced that he would serve as honorary chairman of a `` Points of Light Foundation'' to oversee volunteer efforts, and that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON> would head the foundation's advisory committee. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for $ 25 million a year over the next four years to support the non-profit independent organization, which will solicit matching funds from the private sector. <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had asked him to head the committee Wednesday night, said specific uses for the funding had not been decided. `` This is what I mean when I talk of a thousand points of light: That vast galaxy of people and institutions working together to solve problems in their own back yard,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He first used the `` points of light'' phrase at last summer's Republican convention The president called on all individuals, businesses and institutions to join in the volunteer effort, saying corporations should set up literacy programs to make sure each employee can read and that restaurants and grocery stores should distribute surplus food to soup kitchens and local shelters. In remarks at a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> dinner, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned to politics, saying that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> voters, `` in particular minority and ethnic voters, are shifting from automatic loyalty to the other party and voting Republican more and more often.'' `` We are justly proud of how far we've come as a party _ so far that we now have a good chance of winning the mayor's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the most powerful local office in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> is a leading candidate in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> effort to oust incumbent Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. At a 100th anniversary celebration for the Wall Street Journal, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised the publication. `` In a changing world that offers 64 channels of cable television, the six columns of the Wall Street Journal are as familiar as the morning coffee at our breakfast tables,'' he said. He called the Journal `` one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most trusted publications,'' but joked that `` not every article was a Pulitzer Prize winner. In 1967, a front page story on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> predicted the communist government would n't last the year.'' The president said he actually likes `` because you do n't carry Doonesbury,'' the comic strip that frequently lampoons <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The Journal carries no comic strips. He also returned to his main theme of the day of volunteerism, noting that some of the nation's top corporate executives were in the audience. `` It is my request _ I believe, your obligation _ to donate the services of the talented and the enterprising within your ranks. Many are doing this now. Everyone should do this.''

<TEXT>
 Members of a radical group set an American flag afire Thursday, a day after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> affirmed their right to do so. Outside the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, members of a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> called the burning of the national banner `` a celebration'' and referred to the flag and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in profane terms. Elsewhere, however, congressmen and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s mayor decried the high court's ruling that burning the flag was protected by the right to free speech. In <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, military veterans reacted with shock and dismay. The high court on Wednesday ruled 5-4 in favor of <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> `` <PERSON> Joey </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who torched the flag during a protest at the 1984 Republican Convention in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. He appealed a one-year sentence and a $ 2,000 fine. The decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> knocked down anti-flag desecration laws in 48 states. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, introduced a joint resolution that proposed a constitutional amendment `` to protect the dignity of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. flag.'' The Bill of Rights, whose first article protects freedom of speech, `` should not imply the right to desecrate the flag,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a Republican from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> also said that the Constitution should be amended to prohibit such political expression. `` We were shocked that the law of the country now is that you can burn a flag with impunity,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shewmake </PERSON>, state adjutant quartermaster of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said he did n't understand why anyone would want to burn the flag `` People have died for that piece of cloth,'' he said. `` If they do n't like our flag, they can go live under another flag and I do n't think they'd like that at all. <PERSON> Shewmake </PERSON>, a 23-year <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> veteran, said he was proud to see the American flag while serving overseas during the occupation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> after World War II and in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Solidarity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which ran the union's campaign for the new parliament, decided Thursday not to disband now that elections are over, patching a dispute that threated to split the opposition. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and the union's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> advocated closing the local <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> so that activists nationwide could concentrate on rebuilding the Solidarity trade union itself. But activists strongly disagreed, and after a daylong debtate passed two vaguely worded resolutions that Solidarity national spokesman <PERSON> Janusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said meant local groups could continue to exist for now. About 120 members of the national <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ set up in December by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to advise the union on political, social and economic issues _ gathered in a <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> auditorium for the debate. During the debate, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> defended a weekend resolution by the union's <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to concentrate efforts on rebuilding the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc's first independent trade union, which regained legal status April 17. Union organizing took a back seat during the election campaign. But the final resolution thanked the local Citizens Committees, which helped Solidarity to its overwhelming election victory, and said they should help prepare for free municipal elections, a Solidarity goal. The executive's resolution to dissolve the local committees `` should not be treated as something that should be implemented immediately,'' <PERSON> Onyszkiewicz </PERSON> said. `` Today's resolution ... says one should approach their transformation with flexibility,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is of the opinion that the main task at the present moment is expanding and strengthening the Solidarity trade union and Farmers Solidarity as guarantors of democratic reforms in our country,'' it said. A 14-member commission was appointed to present proposals on the future of the national <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> by Sept. 10. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> appeared concerned the continued existence of the committees would drain strength from rebuilding the union. `` Today if we get divided into two ... we weaken the most important stream and the most important stream today is the broad stream of working people,'' he said. A top adviser to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> who opposed disbanding the committees tried to downplay conflict. `` First of all we want to say in the current situation that we maintain unity, that we are able to maintain it and that there is no conflict between the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the bodies of the union,'' said <PERSON> Bronislaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Geremek </PERSON>. The weekend decision was greeted with anger from members of the local committees, flush with their electoral triumph, which saw Solidarity win 99 of of 100 seats in the freely contested <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in June 4 and June 18 elections. Solidarity also won all seats available to it in the lower house, the Sejm. Critics said the decision was to prevent the committees in each of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s 49 provinces from becoming parallel, possibly rival organizations to Solidarity. The dispute reflected contradictions within Solidarity over whether it is ultimately a trade union or a political movement and whether it will be led by workers or intellectuals. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said Solidarity should be mainly a union, with politics eventually shifted to newly emerging political groups. But Solidarity nevertheless has a broad following among non-workers _ students, intellectuals and professionals _ who are more interested in pressing communist authorities for democratic political changes.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Thursday night approved a compromise bill to remove the remaining wellhead price controls from natural gas. The <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> compromise was cleared in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by a voice vote. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> must take final action on the bill before it can be sent to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is expected to sign it. The legislation is designed to remove all federal price controls on natural gas by Jan. 1, 1993. It is not expected to affect retail prices much because most gas under controls already is selling below the official ceilings. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s action came two days after <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators agreed that gas from wells drilled after the date of enactment of the bil would be deregulated on May 15, 1991. All other gas not already decontrolled would be freed from the federal ceilings when sales contracts are renegotiated or Jan. 1, 1993, whichever comes first. About two-thirds of the nation's natural gas was freed from controls in 1978.

 A congressman said Thursday that death squads, possibly hired by drug traffickers, are hunting down members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> said in a communique sent to <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> leaders that more than 100 members were killed in the eastern plains in the last year. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> confirmed his statements. The ministry said previously that guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> are targeting <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. The guerrillas may be taking revenge for right-wing death squads killing more than 800 members of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s biggest leftist party, the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, in four years. But <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper quoted the congressman as saying he is not entirely convinced that guerrillas are behind the killings of <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Infante </PERSON> <PERSON> Leal </PERSON> said the gunmen could be hired by drug traffickers who are killing Liberals because a <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> faction has sought an alliance with the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Drug runners have been at war with guerrillas here for years because of rebel attempts to kidnap drug traffickers or members of their families and hold them for ransom. Also, drug traffickers resent guerrilla demands of payment of a so-called revolution tax in areas where traffickers raise coca plants for producing cocaine or where the traffickers have ranches, national police have said. The <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members have been killed in <LOCATION> Guaviare </LOCATION>, Meta and <LOCATION> Vichada </LOCATION> states, areas where coca bushes are grown in abundance and where the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> have an estimated 5,000 guerrillas.

<TEXT>
 A leader of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, one of the most rigid in the Soviet bloc, on Thursday defended <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official version of the crackdown on pro-democracy activists <PERSON> Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, a member of the party's policy-making Politburo, also denounced democratic reform in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and backed the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, who also serves as secretary of the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, made his comments in a Politburo report he read to a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting on foreign policy. Speaking about the violent suppression of student demonstrators in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has published all official Chinese statements with the purpose of denying `` Western horror stories'' and to present `` objective information.'' Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources say the death toll in the June 3-4 crackdown may have been as high as 3,000. The Chinese government's most recent report says 100 soldiers and 100 civilians died. Most East Germans are able to watch West German television. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, whose speech was distributed by the government-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, said the `` peaceful student demonstrations'' in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were intended to be used for a `` counter-revolutionary overthrow of people's power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The Politburo makes all key decisions in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and its report expresses the views of the country's aging leaders, led by <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, head of the party. The party has strongly resisted Soviet-style economic and political reforms, and <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>'s speech reaffirmed the country's leading hard-line position in the Soviet bloc The Politburo report said <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will remain true to its own policies and made no hints at any reforms. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and opposition groups have agreed to hold multi-party elections by next summer. Last week, hundreds of thousands of Hungarians turned out for an emotional reburial of <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the communist leader executed after leading a revolt crushed by Soviet troops in 1956. `` Under the flag of ` renewing socialism,' forces are at work that strive for the removal of socialism. In this connection, the developments in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> fill us with great concern,'' <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said. He accused Western leaders whom he did not identify of stepping up ideological and economic pressure on communist countries in an attempt to make them reject communism and turn to capitalism. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall will continue to protect <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from `` economic plundering, from the penetration of criminal elements ... and from drug smuggling.'' He said the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall will remain as long as the `` reasons that led to its construction remain.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> claims it built the wall to prevent a possible attack or infiltration from the West. However, Western governments agree that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> built the wall at <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> insistence to stop the massive flow of refugees from East to West. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a speech during a visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> this month, challenged <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to tear down the Berlin Wall. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> noted that `` nothing is eternal'' and that the wall was not `` a great problem'' in East-West relations, but he did not call for its removal when he visited <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last week.

 A 23-year-old suspect in the slayings of his parents and two other relatives was shot and killed by state police Thursday after he opened fire, ending a six-hour standoff, authorities said. <PERSON> Eben </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> was killed around 5 p.m. at a <LOCATION> Schoharie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> farm, where he'd fled after his father, mother, brother and grandfather were killed Wednesday in neighboring <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, officials said. The four were shot to death at the grandfather's cabin in woods just outside <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, about 50 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. The grandfather, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Klepetar </PERSON>, 78, was found shot in his bed. Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON>, 59, and his 22-year-old son <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> were found at the edge of a pond near the cabin, and his wife, <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 48, was found in the pond, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. She had apparently been trying to flee. The bodies were discovered Thursday morning by a social worker who'd found a note <PERSON> Eben </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> left on the front door of his father's <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> law office, said <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>. `` The note on the office door of the law office was written in third person to make it look like his father did it,'' <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. A police helicopter tracked <PERSON> Eben </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> to a pond a few miles north of the crime scene and a half-mile away from the family's home. Police cornered <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> there around 11 a.m., and had been trying to persuade him to surrender when he started shooting, <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON> said. People who knew the suspect said he had a history of getting into trouble. `` He got into his share of trouble as a kid, just as any kid would, but in the last few years he really went bad,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyatt </PERSON>, who employed <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> three years ago at a <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> lumber yard. The slayings shocked residents of this town of less than 2,000 people. `` I could n't believe it when I heard about it. I was just sick,'' said diner owner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLeo </PERSON>. `` I just ca n't figure it out. They were beautiful people.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> was involved in many community affairs, while <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> McDowell </PERSON> volunteered to tend flowers along <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>'s main street, residents said. `` They were a very respected family,'' said <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>.

 Children across the country have put up allowances and revenues from Kool-Aid stands to raise more than $ 2,000 for a crippled cub named <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> the Bear, who needs an operation. `` Never have we had this kind of attention with an animal,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON>, whose Wildlife Images rehabilitation center cares for wild animals ranging from pygmy owls to cougars. Weighing just 10 pounds, the black bear was found as an orphan a month ago west of <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` He was caught by a dog,'' <PERSON> Siddon </PERSON> said. `` His legs were dislocated.

<TEXT>
 A former babysitter testified Thursday that actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> referred to the mother of his son as his wife while having lunch with the child in a pizza parlor in the summer of 1985. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON>, who said she had met Hurt for the first time, testified on the fourth day of a trial to determine whether the actor had a common-law marriage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> with former ballerina <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>. `` How do you like working with my wife?'' she quoted Hurt as asking about <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, mother of <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, now 6. The babysitter said that occasionally when she went for walks with the boy, people would come up and say, `` How is Mrs. Hurt?'' That comment was stricken from the record because it was not given in response to a question. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, 32, bases her claim of a common-law marriage on four weeks she spent with Hurt in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, from Dec. 9, 1982, when he learned he was divorced from actress <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>, to Jan. 10, 1983, when Hurt and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> left the state. Hurt was filming `` The Big Chill'' there at the time. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> now seeks to have the court declare that she and Hurt are married so she can get a `` divorce'' and a share of his assets, estimated by her lawyer, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, to be about $ 10 million. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> was another of several witnesses who have testified that Hurt called <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> his wife, but no one has said he made such a reference during the four-week period in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> on which <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' claim is based. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> recognizes common-law marriages; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> does not.

 Free speech advocates are hailing a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling in a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burning case they say fortifies and expands constitutional protection for political dissent.

The court said <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> authorities violated a protester's rights when they prosecuted him under a state law barring desecration or destruction of the flag.

<HEAD>State Tries To Shut Down Hazardous Waste Handler</HEAD>

 A little company on a steamy bayou, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processors </ORGANIZATION>, raked in millions using what it said was a revolutionary process to turn toxic waste into glassy black rubble it sold for construction projects. Last year, it handled wastes from more than 2,500 companies in 48 states. Meanwhile, residents of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> accuse the company of cancer-causing pollution. State environmental officials have levied over $ 5 million in fines and last month halted sale of its black `` aggregate.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Breaux </PERSON>, D-La., held hearings on <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> last year and two federal grand juries reportedly have studied it This month, the company laid off nearly a fourth of its 400 employees. Competitors, who call the process a sham, say the end is near. But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s fiery-tempered president, vows he wo n't shut down without a long and costly fight. `` Anybody with half-way brains would know this is a much better process to handle this material than any other method in the country today ... or in the world today,'' he said. `` As far as we're concerned, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> is on death row. It's just a matter of hooking up the juice,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based lobbying group for <ORGANIZATION> Rollins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and other waste handlers whose prices were undercut Marine Shale began burning hazardous waste in its 275-foot long kiln in 1985, charging up to $ 300 per 55-gallon drum to take toxic materials from those who produce them. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> says that's about half what others charged. It sold its aggregate, as fill for roadbeds and boat slips, for $ 1 a ton. `` MSP gross revenues for the first quarter 1989 are the highest ever!'' boasts a flier in the office. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said that translates to roughly $ 22 million. Profit ordinarily would run 15 percent, he said, but millions in legal fees are making a healthy dent. And business has dropped off 50 percent, he said, since the May 26 order banning sale of Marine Shale aggregate. The <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> says the huge, computer-monitored kiln is nothing more than a glorified incinerator. <PERSON> Fortuna </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> skirted environmental laws by calling itself a recycler instead of a disposer. <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> countered that it was operating under some of the nation's strictest air and water permits _ stricter than those for a <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON> incinerator at <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> officials backed that claim, though the agency has accused the company of frequently violating the permits and is trying to have them revoked. The state has complained of sloppy storage, violation of air quality standards and refusal to move an allegedly dangerous storage barge off Bayou Bouef alongside the plant. Marine Shale has complied with some <ORGANIZATION> DEQ </ORGANIZATION> orders and has appealed others, including one revoking its permits because it allegedly treated waste from a foreign country, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, in violation of state law. Company vice president and general counsel <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> has repeatedly accused DEQ of delaying administrative hearings on orders, some dating to 1986. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> is eager to get DEQ hearings over with so he can take matters to court. <ORGANIZATION> Miriam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> is just as eager as <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>, but for different reasons. `` I see a long road ahead for those of us who would like to see Marine Shale closed. And we're looking to <ORGANIZATION> DEQ </ORGANIZATION> to do the job.'' Mrs. Price claims a personal stake. Her granddaughter, <PERSON> Nicole </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, is one of six children afflicted with a rare form of cancer, malignant neuroblastoma. The mother of one child who died from the disease has filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>, blaming it for the cancer. Mrs. Price points out that all six were diagnosed after the company began operations. Nonetheless, she said, `` I can not accuse them _ I have no proof.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study of the neuroblastoma cases notes that the cancer is usually thought to originate before birth and that three of the stricken children were born before Marine Shale began operating. In almost four years of study, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> has yet to say whether <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> has done anything wrong or if it should be allowed to keep operating. `` We really ca n't make additional comments on Marine Shale, because of the legal complexities of the case,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Meacham </PERSON>. More than a year ago, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> did say <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s aggregate posed no `` imminent or substantial endangerment to the public health or environment.'' The state halted sales because of evidence that rain, especially acid rain, could cause lead and other metals to dissolve out of the material in higher amounts than the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> allows, said <ORGANIZATION> DEQ </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Megginson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Megginson </PERSON> cited tests revealing lead levels of .55 parts per million to 1.5 ppm vs. an <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> standard of .5 ppm. <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON>, however, said standards that apply to <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION>'s product allow up to 5 ppm. <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> said he would not immediately fight the <ORGANIZATION> DEQ </ORGANIZATION> order in court, but would hold up shipments of the aggregate and try to work out an agreement with state officials to test the product and ensure its safety. As Marine Shale's appeals drag on, its giant kiln, resembling an elongated cement mixer, continues to turn and aggregate continues to tumble out. Wastes poured into the kiln are heated to 2,000 degrees for 2 -LCB- hours while vapors from the process run through two giant buildings lined with scores of filters and rise into the air through a smokestack 140 feet high. What's left is a brownish-gray powder. If tests show toxic materials were eliminated, the process is over; the powder also can be used in road-building, and has been used to soak up liquid waste. If toxic metals like lead or barium are found in the powder _ they do n't burn _ it is blown into furnaces, melted and cooled to form the gem-like chunks <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> calls `` Black Gold.'' Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shale </ORGANIZATION> continues negotiating with <ORGANIZATION> DEQ </ORGANIZATION> over the complicated issues surrounding its process. If that fails, <PERSON> Eldredge </PERSON> said, `` It wo n't be decided until it gets to the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>.''

<HEAD>Maybe We Consumers Aren't So Deep In Debt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<UNK>AP Business Analyst</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans have learned to use debt like never before, but it does n't necessarily follow that they are creating an economic problem in doing so. That assumption _ that consumer debt is dangerously high _ is often made after a casual glance at lending figures that, among other things, show the debt-to-income ratio at sky-high levels compared to a few years ago. A decade ago, for example, analysts worried when the ratio reached 15.5, meaning that consumer debt was 15.5 percent of disposable income. When it topped 16 percent a few years later they warned that a recession was due. True to the forecast, the economy fell into the brief recession of 1980, and then into a much deeper recession that lasted from July 1981 to November 1982. That brought the ratio back under 15. Now, and for the past several years, the ratio is back over 15 _ and 16 and 17 and 18, numbers that had never been seen before and which were n't even foreseen a decade ago. Theories abound: Lenders have lowered their standards, deregulation has made lenders more aggressive in seeking customers, prices have risen faster than many incomes, and stable employment has created a sense of security. Some critics believe that the sense of security from stable jobs is a false one. Credit evaluation systems, they point out, rarely deal explicitly with the question of how long employment might last. They judge by the past, not future. Other observers, however, suggest the explanation is in the credit figures themselves rather than in consumer behavior. What seems to be a problem of too much borrowing, they say, may be statistical rather than economic. Here are some numbers to digest: _ Revolving credit accounts for about 30 percent of consumer installment credit, rising from $ 14 billion in 1975 to $ 185 billion now, a gain of 1,200 percent _ Total installment credit grew from $ 160 billion in 1975 to $ 666 billion over the same period _ Much of this credit is in the form of money owed to retailers But a growing amount of it is in bank credit card balances. In 10 years, the latter have risen from less than 50 percent of revolving credit to almost two-thirds. However, the story told by these figures, provided by economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, is not what it appears to be. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON>, dean of <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, calls attention to a fact often overlooked, that more than half these bank balances _ 25 percent for retail cards _ are repaid each month at no interest. In effect, these balances _ which keep the ratios at record high levels _ are not `` debt'' in the minds of consumers, but convenient substitutes for the use of cash and checks in making transactions. <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> estimates, conservatively he says, that $ 75 billion of these cash and check substitute balances are not debt in the traditional sense. Remove them, he says, and the debt-to-income ratio drops all the way down to 16.5. While that percentage is nearly three points lower than the latest official figures, it still appears high. In fact, it is about as high as the rate that prevailed just before the 1981-1982 recession. Still, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> suggests, the ratio might not have the same significance now as it had back then. Several lending and borrowing changes tend to put a new and different interpretation on the figures. Important among these changes is a sharp rise in the share of consumer credit accounted for by consumers in the top 20 percent of the income tables, many of whom have sufficient assets to support debt. The behavior of these upper-income folks may have changed, <PERSON> Dunkelberg </PERSON> suggests, because of such things as tax-deductible, second mortgage lines of credit and the proliferation of credit cards. As he analyzes the scene, the high debt-to-income ratio may not be evidence of individuals taking on greater risk as much as it is a sign that more people are using debt, for convenience or other reasons.

 <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, herself a beneficiary of the teachings of The Group Theatre, narrates a homage to the handful of pioneers who changed the face of modern <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> theater in the season opener of PBS' `` American Masters'' on Monday. Theatergoers take innovation and risk-taking for granted nowadays. But when <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Clurman </PERSON> founded The Group Theatre in 1931, <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION> was awash in polite drawing-room comedies and stodgy, mainstream drama. All three had worked at the Theatre Guild, <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> as a casting director, <PERSON> Clurman </PERSON> as a play reader and <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON> as a stage manager and sometime actor. But they felt no emotional connection to the works there. Amid the troubled times following the crash on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, they joined together in a common belief that the theater should be more of an outlet for societal reflection and formed a repertory company that would produce American plays on Broadway. The 90-minute documentary, `` Broadway Dreamers: The Legacy of the Group Theatre,'' includes <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>'s interviews, over a five-year period, with as many of the original members and associates as possible, including <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>. Also included are archival interviews with the late <PERSON> Clurman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON>. The Group Theatre lasted only a decade, but its impact is still felt in <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> theater and film today. The teachers it launched handed down a then ground-breaking philosophy of craft combined with creativity. Group members <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, <PERSON> Strasberg </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Meisner </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>'s teacher -RRB- and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> numbered among their students <PERSON> Marlon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brando </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Streep </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, playwright <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamet </PERSON> and directors <PERSON> Sydney </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogdanovich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON> also talks to many actors, playwrights and directors who began their careers with The Group Theatre. Interspersed with the interviews is footage from a 1987 <LOCATION> Williamstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, stage tribute to The Group Theatre. Appearing to perform readings are <PERSON> Woodward </PERSON>, <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Winters </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Burstyn </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Naughton </PERSON>, among others.

<HEAD>Past Is No Burden to Guitarist's Creativity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

 Guitarist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> ca n't escape his past, but he says the devotion fans have to his old band, the Dregs, has n't stifled his creativity or kept him from looking to the future Wherever <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> plays these days, people want to hear the old songs he wrote and performed with the Dregs, an eclectic instrumental group that never had anything approaching a hit record but garnered an intensely loyal _ though relatively small _ following. The band, originally called the Dixie Dregs, was formed in 1977 and broke up in 1983, leaving behind six albums and memories of frenzied, stimulating concerts. The continuing interest in the old material is no problem for the 35-year-old <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>. `` What allows me and my family to eat is the fact that people do come back,'' he said in an interview during a short break from a month-long club tour to promote his latest solo album, `` High Tension Wires'' for <ORGANIZATION> MCA </ORGANIZATION> records. `` It's like one guy, a baker, in a neighborhood of a big city doing his job the best he can. He gets a following and, as long as he does the job, people will come back. `` I'm more like that neighborhood baker than <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>, but the repeat business gives me confidence there will be a tomorrow.'' <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>'s latest music is, like the Dregs, a wide mix of styles. He incorporates rock, jazz, classical, <ORGANIZATION> Celtic </ORGANIZATION> and country and fuses them into a sound that somehow manages to be both manic and sweetly lyrical. There's also a bit more acoustic guitar than before from the five-time winner of Guitar Player magazine's `` Best Overall'' readers poll category. Though <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> is joined by some of his former bandmates on the album, which contains a remake of the Dregs' `` Leprechaun Promenade'' recorded during a brief 1988 reunion, his touring trio includes new sidemen <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Romaine </PERSON> on drums and <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Larou </PERSON> on bass. <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said he was excited about the new band, which hit the road after only three days of rehearsal. He likes the freedom of playing in front of an audience, and relishes the contrast from the more methodical approach he takes in the studio. `` Playing live is the ultimate expression. When you improvise, it's stream of consciousness,'' he said. `` Playing live is like driving a race car. You have to react quickly, and hope you're right. The live show includes songs from the Dregs days, numbers from his two previous <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> <PERSON> Band </PERSON> albums and about three selections from the new record. The band does not play many of the quieter songs on stage. `` We try to keep the energy level up,'' <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said. Since the break-up of the Dregs, <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> also has played with the group <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and sat in with the reformed <PERSON> Lynyrd </PERSON> <PERSON> Skynyrd </PERSON>. Those projects gave him another outlet for his guitar playing _ that of sideman instead of bandleader. `` Part of the reason I did the thing with <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> was to completely experience the opposite -LRB- of leading a band -RRB-,'' he said. `` In manageable doses it's fun, it's less pressure. Just playing guitar parts and showing up for gigs alive _ that's a lot less pressure.'' <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> also is an accomplished pilot who flies his group's airplane from date to date He also holds clinics for young guitarists in almost every town in which he performs. He said the guitarists coming up now are approaching the instrument differently than when he started out, but their goals have not changed. `` The emphasis now is more on technique _ and I do n't mean moronic technique _ than on writing,'' he said. `` There's more emphasis on two-handed playing and on whammy-bar playing. `` But I guess the motivating factor is the same as 10, 20 years ago. The kids want to play and make good music come out of their guitars.'' <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> also sees a resurgence in interest in instrumental rock music, and he finds that gratifying. `` But it would make me feel better if it had happened when we were doing it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Will an economically integrated <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, scheduled for 1992, cooperate in world trade for the benefit of everyone or fight to maintain a privileged position for itself? On either side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> the almost automatic answer varies little: Why of course <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will pursue an open trade policy. Does n't everyone know that free trade _ trade without artificial barriers _ benefits everyone? The automatic response and the eagerness to assure, however, may be only a veneer covering vast uncertainties. An economically unified <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> could be an amiable giant or, if provoked, a muscled bully protecting his turf. In the abstract, every important trading nation professes an almost theological belief in free trade. But each also is aware of the benefits, however temporary, of limiting the flow of foreign goods into its markets. Which course will <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> take? By the end of 1992, members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> plan to remove almost all barriers to each other's trade, investment and movement of labor, creating a common market of 320 million people. Obviously, they would n't do so if they did n't believe in mutual benefits for each other. Instead of a dozen relatively weak markets for goods, the united market would be an economic entity comparable to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Having achieved that, will they then seek to protect their `` free'' market from others? Will they restrict Japanese and American access, or will they express their faith in open competition by leaving their market doors ajar? While the latter seems the most likely route, the underlying uncertainty is aroused again and again by incidents that, isolated from the bigger picture, seem of far less importance. This week in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, for example, some European trade negotiators felt the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had violated the spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by threatening trade sanctions against <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Those sanctions have not been imposed, and there is some question about whether Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> really intends to do anything at all about what he perceives to be unfair trade practices by these nations. The mere threat, however, was sufficient to raise tempers _ and in trade talks, whenever tempers rise the threat of retaliation soon follows. A simple French television commercial, now two years old but still replayed in the minds of wary Americans and Japanese, also demonstrates how close those uncertainties are to the surface. The commercial, sponsored by the French government, showed a skinny boxer faced down by a huge American football player and a massive and menacing Japanese sumo wrester. The fate of the skinny French boxer seemed bleak, but he did not run. No need to, because soon he was surrounded by 11 other boxers who helped rout the huge American football player and the massive Japanese wrestler. In short, scratch a free-trader on either side of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> or anywhere else in the world and you might find a protectionist. The latter might bury their sympathies for the sake of public decorum, but seldom do they bury them so deep that they can not be aroused and resurrected immediately.

<HEAD>Sexual Harassment Troubles Churches As Women Clergy Increase</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Shocked at its extent, churches are grappling with a newly recognized problem in their own domain _ sexual harassment of women, particularly female clergy. Concern about it has risen as increasing numbers of women have entered the ordained ministry, traditionally a profession of males and largely limited to them until modern times. The trouble, however, has surfaced among lay women as well as clergywomen. It has turned up in `` every setting of the church,'' declared the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, after reviewing reports about it. One of the center's research projects found that of 138 women clergy surveyed, 45 percent of them said they had been sexually harassed in the workplace, that is, in church precincts. `` It's a startling figure,'' said <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Breitling </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, the center's executive director. `` The harassment was not identified by type, but no matter how you define it, that's an inordinately high number. `` We were shocked.'' However, there has been little or no awareness of the problem until recently, she said, but it now is drawing increased attention in major Protestant denominations, most of which now ordain women. `` It was very, very hidden and people did not talk about it, but now they're beginning to talk about it in a straightforward way, and seek ways to deal with it,'' she said in a telephone interview. Especially in church, `` you expect to be treated with respect and dignity,'' she said. For church colleagues `` to intimidate, take advantage, harass or molest is just unconscionable. `` Unfortunately, those kind of things are happening. Harassment is occuring even in the church. The church needs to speak to that problem in its own life, just as it speaks to things in the culture at large.'' Among lay women, the center's survey found 20 percent of them reported incidents of sexual harassment within the church, less than half the proportion of women clergy doing so. The 1.7-million-member <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> through its antecedant Congregationalism -LRB- merged in 1957 with the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- pioneered women's ordination, beginning in the l850's. Sixteen percent of the denomination's 10,000 clergy are women. Other Protestant bodies, including Presbyterians, Lutherans, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodists </ORGANIZATION>, Episcopalians and others, have begun ordaining women only since the 1950's. More than 20,000 women now are among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> clergy. Sexual harassment has aroused concern in several denominations. The Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> -RRB- last week called for development of a church-wide policy on sexual misbehavior in the church household. In most denominations, `` all of us are very much concerned about the issue,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubois </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, Presbyterian specialist on women in church employment. A special study about it is under way in the Northeast. `` It's no respecter of denominations,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Breitling </PERSON> said. `` It's a very common experience. It's also one we've avoided dealing with. But the issue is coming to the fore in most every denomination.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> at its l986 governing conference said sexual harassment has been documented in congregations, agencies, seminaries and other institutions. One limited survey found one in eight <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> women reported being sexually harassed in church environs. The denomination called for grievance procedures for victims and penalties for offenders. It also launched a denomination-wide study on the extent of church sexual harassment. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s women's center proposes a resolution for the denomination's General Synod June 29-July 4, saying women volunteers, seminarians, pastors and lay employees report `` varied experiences of sexual harassment.'' That is a `` disappointing fact in an institution that is based on values of equality and respect for all persons,'' the measure says. It calls for gathering of more data and developing guidelines about the matter. The resolution identifies two types of sexual harassment, one being the `` imposition of unwelcome sexual activity, suggestion or behavior in a relationship of unequal power.'' That refers to such situations as between pastor and associate minister or intern, or between clergywomen and members of the church board of trustees when superiors manipulate women into demoralizing affairs. A second type of harassment cited is the creation of a `` hostile, intimidating atmosphere in the workplace'' that offends or disturbs women personnel, even if there is `` no direct damage to victims.'' `` Even if it's seemingly harmless inuendo, it can be offensive and create an unpleasant work situation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Breitling </PERSON> said. `` There are a lot of variations and complex relationship questions.'' While open, friendly hugs or pats between mutually respecting associates are not considered in the harassment category, she said objectionable activity generally is distinguishable by victims. As one woman put it, `` I've been hugged, and I've been ` groped' and I know the difference.

 Eastern Orthodoxy's objections to ordaining women and a British clergywoman's reactions produced a strained moment here at the recent interdenominational <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Mission and Evangelism. On behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Oriental Orthodox participants, Bishop <PERSON> Antonius </PERSON> <PERSON> Markos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> said they supported a study by the World Council of Churches of full participation of women in church life, but not in the priesthood. To admit women to the priesthood is `` not, for us, subject to debate, since it is contrary to <PERSON> Christology </PERSON>, ecclesiology, tradition and practices'' of the church through the ages. Later, in discussing a proposal expressing joy at growing unity among Christians, the Rev. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said she was `` deeply hurt'' by the Orthodox statement and added: `` How can I as a woman, an ordained woman ... express joy when I experience rejection and hurt?'' <PERSON> Markos </PERSON> replied that the Orthodox did not intend to hurt anybody but `` in love, we have to express our faith.'' He added: `` Any woman ordained by her own church, if her church accepts her, we will give her all respect.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When it comes to <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, `` Hamlet'' is still very much the thing. In recent months, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s two large government-subsidized theaters have tackled the Prince of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, and two other <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> plays are now on using <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> as a central character. It remains one of the world's favorite plays, and <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s celebrated soliloquy has become universal, whether in Chinese -LRB- `` si hai shi huo'' -RRB-, Swedish -LRB- `` Att vara eller icke vara'' -RRB- or English -LRB- `` To be or not to be'' -RRB- In <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Patrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chereau </PERSON>'s production recently swept the Moliere Awards, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> equivalent of Broadway's <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has averaged eight major `` Hamlet'' productions every year for the past three years. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Public Theater presented it in 1986 with <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kline </PERSON> as the prince. Women have played him, too, notably the great French actress <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernhardt </PERSON> a century ago, <PERSON> Dame </PERSON> <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Andersonand </PERSON> more recently <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Venora </PERSON> at the Public in 1982. <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> called it `` the best play ever written,'' and his 1948 film portrayal was the only <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> work ever to win Academy Awards for best film and best actor. Others have tried to shape it to the times. The great 18th-century actor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> hated the graveyard scene. `` I swore,'' he said, `` that I would not leave the stage'till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act.'' The Victorians left out <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s lapses into vernacular, along with anything else that might portray him as less than a perfect prince. Nowadays, producers are more apt to drop the subplot involving the agents and friends of <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Rosencrantz </PERSON> and Guildenstern, a trend which in itself inspired a whole, much-applauded play by British dramatist <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoppard </PERSON> about two characters who find they do not exist outside the play. In 1987, Swedish director <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>'s acclaimed production with his <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dramatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> had a week-long run in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, and in September Russian director <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyubimov </PERSON> will stage `` Hamlet'' with a British company at the <ORGANIZATION> Leicester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haymarket </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>. Drawn from Scandinavian legend, `` Hamlet'' is about a prince who comes home from university to discover that his father has been murdered by his brother who has usurped the throne and married the queen he has widowed. Setting out to clean up the rot in the kingdom of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> plunges into a jungle of intrigue, thwarted passion and switched poisons. He emerges triumphant, only to complete the tragedy by dying in a sword fight. At its most basic, <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> is a rattling good revenge yarn. But it is also that rare play whose significance can continually be reshaped to meet a society's preconceptions. Thus, audiences over the ages have seen <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> as Marxist, capitalist, pacifist, militarist, aristocrat, populist, Freudian obsessive and man of action. This troubles some actors including <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryce </PERSON>, who derides what he calls the `` Hamlet industry.'' They wonder whether the play's appeal is also its weakness: whether by applying to everything and everyone, `` Hamlet'' risks being about nothing in particular. `` Is Hamlet really such a difficult part to get right?'' asks <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Truss </PERSON> in The Listener magazine. `` The answer seems to be that, on the contrary, it is awfully hard to get it wrong, since any interpretation seems to be valid.'' In recent years Londoners have been treated to <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Rees </PERSON>' dry, intensely cerebral <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stormare </PERSON>'s manic, military <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> for <PERSON> Ingmar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergman </PERSON>; and now <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>' highly emotional and impetuous <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> at the National. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>'s production continues the National's tradition of doing a `` Hamlet'' near the start of each artistic director's tenure <PERSON> Day-Lewis </PERSON>, best known for the films `` The Unbearable Lightness of Being,'' `` My Beautiful Laundrette'' and `` A Room With a View,'' has inherited a part played in 1963 by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON> and in 1976 by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON>. Also on show are <PERSON> Iris </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>'s `` The Black Prince,'' adapted from her 1973 novel, and the revival of <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chekhov </PERSON>'s 1887 `` <PERSON> Ivanov </PERSON>,'' with <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> as a penniless landowner who sees himself as a failed Hamlet figure. <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, 69, first encountered <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> as a school text when she was 15. She `` an insane passion'' for the work, similar to that of <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, the sardonic tax inspector of `` The Black Prince'' who comes alive when thinking or speaking of <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON>. `` I became absolutely entranced by it and by <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON> generally,'' she recalled in an interview. `` He's very good on politics and power ... a great source of inspiration to novelists.'' From <PERSON> Garrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> through <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrymore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> to today's acting generation, <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> remains the hurdle every classical actor must overcome to attain true celebrity. And they rarely agree on whether <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> is an easy role or a difficult one. `` It's quite easy, because it's such an accommodating part which adapts itself to the personality of the actor,'' argues <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Pennington </PERSON>, who played the role in 1980 at <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rylance </PERSON>, who plays `` Hamlet'' in the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>'s current <LOCATION> Stratford </LOCATION> production, disagrees. `` I find it utterly enigmatic; as soon as one locates the role, it changes,'' the 29-year-old actor said in an interview. `` The challenge is to bring your own jumble of brain cells to the feminine and masculine qualities which are in conflict in the part. ... A lot of people cop out of that.'' <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>, 46, first directed `` Hamlet'' in an acclaimed <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> production in 1980, then returned to the play intrigued by its elasticity. `` I came more and more to see the play as an archetype of growing up, the model for a whole genre of storytelling which has taken over the novel and films, too,'' he said. `` It's about a man trying to accommodate, to come to terms with, a completely alien political and social world. When he starts off, <PERSON> Hamlet </PERSON> is Everyman, but for the fact that he's a prince. `` This panders to our various fantasy aspirations while at the same time it concurs with our sense of not wanting to grow up, not wanting to be absorbed by an essentially alien world of Realpolitik.''

<HEAD>A Bangladesh Success Story: The Garment Industry ^LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A quiet revolution is taking root behind the soft whir of sewing machines where Bangladeshi women are finding alternatives to poverty, early marriage and frequent childbirth. In this underfed, overpopulated, disaster-prone nation, the garment industry has established itself as a success story both economically and socially. <PERSON> Nahar </PERSON> was 12 years old when her family arranged her marriage to a bicycle-rickshaw puller who, she said, beat her. By the age of 16, she was a deserted wife with an infant son. Traditionally, the only respectable options for a poor village girl like <LOCATION> Nahar </LOCATION> would have been remarriage or becoming a maid. The other possibilities in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s limited female labor market were husking rice, pounding bricks and stones into gravel at construction sites, or prostitution. Instead, a few months after <PERSON> Nahar </PERSON>'s husband cast her out in 1985, a relative offered her a job in the fledgling garment industry. Today, at the age of 20, she is a sewing machine operator at Y.K. Garments on Elephant Road in the center of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> and sends half her monthly salary of 900 takas -LRB- about $ 28 -RRB- home to her mother in the village to take care of her 5-year-old son. Her annual salary of $ 336 is more than double the country's per capita annual income of $ 160. `` I feel I'm the happiest woman on earth,'' she said. `` No one beats me anymore almost every night. I'm independent and I earn my own money.'' Like many Bangladeshis, she goes only by her first name, <PERSON> Nahar </PERSON>, and does not use her last. Such independence is still rare for most Bangladeshi women, but it is a beginning and it is growing. About 300,000 women work in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s clothing factories, making up 90 percent of the industry's work force. The number of export-oriented clothing factories swelled from four in 1979 to 722 in 1988, according to government statistics. Export earnings shot up from $ 500,000 in 1979 to $ 450 million in 1988 and now bring in 35 percent of the nation's foreign exchange. Today <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is the fifth-largest exporter of ready-made clothing to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, after <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, according to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. But the garment industry could help in another problem area _ population growth _ if more women choose to work and marry later, thereby reducing their child-bearing years. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is the world's most densely populated land after the city-states of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. If its birth rate is not checked, its population of 110 million will double within 35 years. According to <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>, 86 percent of the population already lives below the poverty level. <PERSON> Ayesha </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatoon </PERSON>, daughter of a landless peasant in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Rangpur </LOCATION> district, was 11 when she fled to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> in 1984 because her parents planned to marry her off to a 16-year-old boy `` I did not want the marriage,'' she said. `` The job at the garment factory has saved my life. Otherwise I would have ended up either being a maid at a rich man's house or, who knows, in a brothel.'' <PERSON> Ayesha </PERSON> and three of her co-workers at <ORGANIZATION> Meghna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> share a one-room, tin-roofed apartment. That in itself is a social breakthrough in a country where single women are expected to live with their families. One of her roommates, 25-year-old <PERSON> Khodeza </PERSON>, said she left her husband two years ago because he insisted they have a fifth child. The first four were girls, and he wanted a son. `` One night I thought and thought. Suddenly I decided that I ca n't take it anymore. I must leave for a life of my own,'' <PERSON> Khodeza </PERSON> said. `` The garment women have achieved a great social revolution in our conservative Moslem society,'' said <PERSON> Sufia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON>, a women's rights activist and leading poet `` They have done what many of us educated women have failed to achieve so far. Although the women are taking the jobs out of necessity, they are also silently fighting against the social taboos.''

 Eastern Orthodoxy's objections to ordaining women and a British clergywoman's reactions produced a strained moment here at the recent interdenominational <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Mission and Evangelism. On behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Oriental Orthodox participants, Bishop <PERSON> Antonius </PERSON> <PERSON> Markos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> said they supported a study by the World Council of Churches of full participation of women in church life, but not in the priesthood. To admit women to the priesthood is `` not, for us, subject to debate, since it is contrary to <PERSON> Christology </PERSON>, ecclesiology, tradition and practices'' of the church through the ages. Later, in discussing a proposal expressing joy at growing unity among Christians, the Rev. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> said she was `` deeply hurt'' by the Orthodox statement and added: `` How can I as a woman, an ordained woman ... express joy when I experience rejection and hurt?'' <PERSON> Markos </PERSON> replied that the Orthodox did not intend to hurt anybody but `` in love, we have to express our faith.'' He added: `` Any woman ordained by her own church, if her church accepts her, we will give her all respect.''

 <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> believes he lost his arm in the service of his country. His country, until now, has disagreed. The arm _ a casualty of cancer, not combat _ was amputated at the shoulder seven years after <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>'s discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. But the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, now 46 and living in <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, puts the blame for his cancer on Agent Orange, the toxic herbicide <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sprayed over the jungles of southeast <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. He is convinced it was awash in the coffee-colored <LOCATION> Mekong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> water pumped aboard his ship for showers. Like more than 34,000 other <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans who believe they have become ill because of Agent Orange, <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> applied for government disability benefits. And like all but five of those applicants, he was denied. Now <PERSON> Maier </PERSON> hopes his claim will be reconsidered, thanks to a federal judge's ruling in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> last month that found the government failed to give Agent Orange claimants the benefit of the doubt. To the surprise of many veterans, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration decided not to appeal. Instead, Veterans Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> announced that the Department of Veterans Affairs, the new name for the <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, would rewrite its rules for granting disability. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s decision could open the door to claims from hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans. Although 34,000 have applied for disability on the basis of Agent Orange exposure, about 250,000 veterans are listed in a registry of those who believe they were exposed to the herbicide. Many never applied because they believed they did n't stand a chance of getting disability. Officials for some veterans' organizations say they're cautiously optimistic that the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has changed its attitude along with its name. `` It is our feeling at this point that Secretary <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> really does want to see some change,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasinitz </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, the group that brought the lawsuit in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Others remain skeptical, their attitude reflecting the deep bitterness that many <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans feel toward a government that they believe used and abandoned them. `` We'll believe it when we see it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON>, the executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION>, an advocacy group based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> `` It's my feeling that they'll probably do as little as they can,'' said <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosty </PERSON>, an attorney for Swords to Plowshares, a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> group that provides counseling and representation for veterans seeking benefits. Still, Ms. <PERSON> Hosty </PERSON> added, `` I would love to be surprised. I would love to be wrong.'' Agent Orange, named for the orange-striped drums in which it was stored, was developed for the military in the early 1940s. It was a 50-50 mixture of two powerful herbicides _ 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T. In <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops sprayed Agent Orange from the air to strip away the enemy's jungle cover and deplete its crops. It worked devastatingly well. The herbicide was banned after the chemical dioxin, which is present in 2,4,5-T, was found to be the most carcinogenic substance ever tested on laboratory animals. Veterans organizations have pointed to evidence that the herbicide may cause serious disorders, including non-Hodgkins lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma and a liver ailment known as PCT. The VA, on the other hand, has maintained that Agent Orange has been scientifically linked to only one illness in humans, a severe skin rash called chloracne. And the government has insisted that veterans seeking benefits because of chloracne provide proof that they got the rash from Agent Orange, a burden that has been impossible for most to meet. However, in what some veterans see as a partial admission of responsibility, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has provided free medical care to anyone who believes he or she became ill because of Agent Orange. Under <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>'s new orders, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> has begun redrafting its guidelines for disability benefits, starting by changing the way in which it determines whether a `` significant statistical association'' exists between Agent Orange and a disease. A scientific advisory committee is to review the proposed changes at a June 26 meeting, after which they will be published in the Federal Register. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> will make a final decision on the changes, probably in October. Once new guidelines are in place, the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s advisory committee will reconsider whether links exist between Agent Orange and diseases that veterans believe it has caused. Again, a final decision will be up to <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>. The stakes are high, as the makers of Agent Orange can attest. After veterans filed a lawsuit against them, seven chemical companies settled out of court for $ 180 million in 1984. <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> has said cost is irrelevant to the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>'s stance. Disability benefits, which are independent of medical benefits or Social Security, currently range from $ 73 a month for a veteran who is 10 percent disabled to $ 1,468 a month for a veteran who is 100 percent disabled. If just 30,000 veterans were found to be 10 percent disabled, the cost to the government would be more than $ 26 million a year. For that reason alone, some veterans' advocates say they doubt the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> will adopt sweeping changes. `` The VA would literally be opening the doors to tens of thousands of claims,'' said <PERSON> Sparrow </PERSON>. `` I just do n't see how they could do it.'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Juarbe </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> program for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, commended <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> for taking `` a step in the right direction.'' Still, <PERSON> Juarbe </PERSON> said, `` I think the bottom line is, we're still going to require legislation. ... Given the way the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> has ruled in the past, we're not confident that we can rely on the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> to carry out this policy.'' One such piece of legislation was introduced in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month. A bill by <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, would provide disability benefits for veterans who have non-Hodgkins lymphoma or soft-tissue sarcoma, two of the diseases associated with Agent `` It is time to end the bickering over which study shows the most connection between Agent Orange and certain illnesses and time to begin helping <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans,'' said <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant who skippered a patrol boat in the <ORGANIZATION> Mekong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant who was, along with <PERSON> Maier </PERSON>, one of the original plaintiffs in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION>, said he is optimistic about prospects for change. `` I just want the satisfaction of seeing that people are treated with justice and compassion,'' said <PERSON> Claxton </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, who believes his exposure to Agent Orange caused bleeding colitis and a nervous disorder. However, he added: `` Personally, I do n't ever expect to be paid back for what Agent Orange did to me. You pay a heavy price for war.''

<HEAD>Actress Breaks Male Barrier in Turkey by Becoming a Mayor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EMEL ANIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A leading actress has broken one barrier for women on <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s male-dominated political stage by getting elected mayor of <LOCATION> Sisli </LOCATION>, a borough of <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> where fancy residential and shopping areas are ringed by slums. <PERSON> Fatma </PERSON> <PERSON> Girik </PERSON>, 46, believes in personal contact her 550,000-member constituency and in daily personal inspection of public works rather than relying on reports of her staff. Women make better mayors, she recently told a Turkish newspaper. `` I see <LOCATION> Sisli </LOCATION> as my own home and I can communicate much better with women who deal with day-to-day problems,'' she was quoted as saying. Once a month she opens up city hall to constituents who have problems. White-bearded men clutching worry beads, young mothers carrying wailing babies, widows without pensions _ people from the underclass _ come to share their problems with Miss Girik. At one recent meeting a young woman, just graduated from high school, said she was looking for a job. `` Do n't we have anything, at the switchboard or someplace?'' Miss <PERSON> Girik </PERSON> asked her staff. Not at the moment, she was told. That angered her. `` Why did she go to school if she can not even earn a living? Do something,'' she ordered the staff. `` Grandad,'' she pleaded with another supplicant, `` do n't keep coming here everyday. I promise you your water will be connected soon.'' Political experts say it is too early to tell whether <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Girik </PERSON>'s way of doing things _ putting pressure on bureaucracy and stretching rules in favor of common people _ will succeed in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s largest city with an overall population of 7 million. She won the mayoralty in March when her <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Populist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> swept <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s urban centers. During the campaign the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Motherland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates attacked her as unsuitable on grounds that she lacked experience and because of her 25-year-old common-law marriage to film director Memduh Un. `` I am running for mayor of <LOCATION> Sisli </LOCATION>, not for the imam of the <LOCATION> Sisli </LOCATION> mosque,'' she shot back at opponents, referring to the Moslem religious leader. Born in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> to a middle-class family in which the father was a seaman, she quit school after the eighth grade and a few years later made her way into the movie world in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yesilcam </LOCATION> district, mainly on the strength of her looks. She turned out to be a good actress, `` a natural born one,'' says movie critic <PERSON> Erman </PERSON> <PERSON> Sener </PERSON>. She has made 300 movies since starting her film career in 1958 and many are pot-boilers typical of the Turkish movie industry. But, in the past two decades she has specialized in the portrayal of Anatolian peasant women. Heroines played by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Girik </PERSON> fight for their rights and their families against difficult odds and often prevail. Attempting to overcome <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s social and economic problems may be more difficult in real life. `` I have no time for books, for movies anymore.,'' she said `` I am on my feet all day long and hit the bed exhausted.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has invited the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate a truce on negative campaigning. Nobody should hold their breath waiting. Each side is too busy calling the other names for there to be real bargaining about campaign standards. Democrat <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he wants to talk about it. Republican <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> says maybe, if the Democrats will deal on some other topics, too. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said the Democrats should approve campaign reforms President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing, and also should make a fair play agreement on congressional redistricting that will follow the 1990 census. He has said the Republicans were `` ruthlessly gerrymandered'' by Democrats in the last reapportionment and ca n't let it happen again <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> wants a good behavior meeting before anything else is put on the table. The national parties have agreed on campaign standards before. And <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> says he is willing to take up other topics, including reapportionment, in separate meetings later. But this feud is likely to go on, between two strong, active first-year national party chairmen. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s tough guy tactics have just received a vote of confidence plus from his natioal committee members. Some seemed to want him tougher. The committee adopted a resolution commending <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> for the aggressive tactics it said have made him `` the target of unremitting attacks'' by Democrats. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the boss who counts, repudiated a national committee slur against <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, but absolved <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> insists that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> himself should be held responsible for Republican excesses, and says <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> should resign or be fired. He thinks GOP tactics and perhaps <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> personally will become issues among voters, working to Democratic advantage. But the signs so far point the other way. Whatever resentment there may be, it is n't rubbing off on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. His job approval rating is up to 73 percent in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Post-ABC News June poll, matching <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s top rating. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> is willing and happy to serve as a political target, diverting fire away from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, despite the demands of <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and other Democrats that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> be held accountable. So far, to the frustration of the Democrats, the two-track <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> course is succeeding. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said the president ca n't take the bipartisan high road while others `` do the dirty work'' of political infighting. But that is what's happening. The flash point in all of this was a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> memo comparing <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s voting record with that of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, who is gay. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> memo said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> had come out of the liberal closet. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said it was disgusting, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> apologized, and a committee publicist resigned. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> is willing to let it go at that. He says that Republicans who want a return to the war path of `` abusive politics'' are not a majority, and should not be an obstacle to bipartisanship. `` ... The most partisan aspects of any party are probably its national committee, in this case the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Meet the Press. `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He's spoken out time and time again in support of a bipartisan effort. He's wanting, actually working, to get that kind of bipartisanship in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and we're reciprocating.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, meanwhile, was contending that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s political troops `` are out of control.'' He said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> has `` taken politics to the lowest level of my lifetime.'' `` Thanks to the Lee Atwaters of the world, national politics is looking more and more like the coastline of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` Make no mistake, they want the political oil spill of negative campaigning to spread across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The Democratic chairman demanded that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> step out front and take the Republican political lead. Not likely. That's <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s assignment.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Mr. Television at 80: He Doesn't Wear a Dress</HEAD>

 Back when television was in diapers, <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> was in a dress. It was a kinder world then; despite his wardrobe, he became known as `` Mr. Television.'' Forty-one years after the debut of `` Texaco Star Theater,'' <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> wears suits for his rare TV appearances. He smokes big cigars _ Cuban jobs the size of cucumbers. And he has a million memories and monologues gleaned from a career stretching from vaudeville to video. <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> did n't anticipate such success when he moved from the movies -LRB- remember `` Sun Valley Serenade''? -RRB- to the small screen on June 8, 1948. `` The power? Nobody knew the power of television. I did n't. I swear I did n't,'' said the man known to millions as Uncle <PERSON> Miltie </PERSON> when he was television's undisputed king, holding millions of Americans hostage in their living rooms each Tuesday night. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> show of 40 years ago, there were no laugh machines. If the joke bombed, you died,'' recalled <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>, in town to pitch `` <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>: The Second Time Around,'' a three-tape video collection of `` Texaco'' clips. `` That's why I used to say, ` Leave a 9 o'clock wakeup call for the audience.' Or, ` Here's another one you may not care for.' But that's all gone. Unfortunate.'' While <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> was television's first major star _ Time called him `` a strange new phenomenon'' _ modesty -LRB- and the chance for a cheap joke -RRB- prevents him from claiming he was the one behind its creation. `` I did n't start it all,'' <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> said in an interview. Pause. Remove cigar. Punchline. `` It had to be invented first.'' Da-dum-dum. Uncle <PERSON> Miltie </PERSON> at 80 may wear thick pancake makeup and pitch underwear on television, but he still has a keen mind and an incredible recall of names, dates and places. An hour-long chat with <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> includes tales of his days and nights in the <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> -LRB- `` 51st between Seventh and Broadway'' -RRB-, <PERSON> Dave </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- `` right on 52nd Street'' -RRB- and The 500 Club -LRB- `` in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> _ owned by a guy named D'Amato'' -RRB-. And he can drop some names: <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Huston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tallulah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bankhead </PERSON>, <PERSON> Basil </PERSON> <PERSON> Rathbone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>'s worked with them all; he also remembers working with a guy named <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosetti </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Steubenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. `` I said, ` <PERSON> Dino </PERSON>'s a good name, but there's got to be an easier name. Something like <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> or <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>,''' said <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>. `` That's how he got the name.'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> were later guests on `` Texaco Star Theater,'' which dominated all competition in the late 1940s and early'50s. An estimated 90 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s sets were tuned to Uncle <PERSON> Miltie </PERSON> when he was on. <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> began his career at age 5, starting out in a silent movie dubbed `` Tillie's Punctured Romance.'' Even then, he worked with the big names; the film starred <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaplin </PERSON>. By age 12, <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> was on Broadway. He appeared in more than 50 silent films. He did vaudeville, he played the Catskills. And then, after 35 years in the business, <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> went video. He later went on to other variety shows, appearing on `` The Kraft Music Hall'' in the late'50s and serving as host for `` The <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> Show'' in the'60s. He never gave up live performing; after years of playing in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, he now plays twice a year in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>. Last year, he starred with fellow veterans <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON> in a made-for-television flick called `` Side by Side.'' His current TV spots are as a pitchman for underwear in which he confesses, `` At my age, I've done just about everything in my BVDs.'' He's also written a couple of books: a self-titled 1974 autobiography and `` B.S. I Love You,'' a collection of jokes and gags picked up during his long association with the <ORGANIZATION> Friars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` I get interviews where people say, ` <PERSON> Milton </PERSON>, that's a helluva risk you took.' I said, ` It was, but it was n't. Not with the acts I had.' I used to book the best acts available,'' <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> recalled. `` And I told'em, ` Do n't worry about the cameras. They'll catch you.''' Today, <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> does n't watch much TV: `` Debates, sports, ` 20-20' and ` 60 Minutes. And <PERSON> O'Neil </PERSON> _ what's that? _ ` McNeil-Lehrer.' So I do n't watch.'' But with television marking its 50th anniversary, <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>'s role in the medium has again been spolighted. Along with his dress-wearing antics, the <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> legacy includes a reputation as a joke-snatcher _ `` The Thief of Bad Gags,'' the great columnist <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winchell </PERSON> once called him. <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> maintains he started this himself as a publicity scam. And the dresses? `` Too long a story on that,'' said <PERSON> Berle </PERSON>, glancing quickly at two female publicists in the room. `` I'll tell you alone.'' <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> is winding down when he's asked about the first night of `` <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'' _ who was on the show? He pauses, removes his well-chewed stogie and looks straight ahead, going back 41 years in 15 seconds. `` June 8, 1948,'' said <PERSON> Uncle </PERSON> <PERSON> Miltie </PERSON>, pausing again. `` <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>. And a dance team, they were wonderful. Do n't know if you ever saw them: the Zoneys. A brother-sister team. Did n't speak to each other; fought like cats and dogs. A great harmonica artist, <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. And -LRB- bandleader _ ` Is Everybody Happy?' -RRB- <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Berle </PERSON> remembers all the guests; he also remembers the immediate, overwhelming reaction his show produced. `` The next day I walked out of my house on 88th Street, took a cab to the Friars for lunch. I decided to walk the last few blocks. I walked a couple of blocks, and the people were all following me,'' the great entertainer said. `` I never knew so many people saw the show that night. It was the next day. That's how quickly. ... The instantaneous value of that was very remarkable. `` One show.''

 Nearly 13 years ago, the sinister cackle of young <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotten </PERSON> kicked off `` Anarchy in the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION>'' and the brief, remarkable history of The Sex Pistols. `` All we're trying to do is destroy everything,'' the singer boasted at the time, and the punk band made music that lived up to his words. Such songs as `` Holidays in the Sun,'' `` Pretty Vacant'' and `` God Save the Queen'' were an enraged response to the complacent, mainstream rock of the mid-1970s and opened the way for The Clash, <ORGANIZATION> Gang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Four </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>. The Sex Pistols made just one album before breaking up. Rotten quickly distanced himself from his old band, reverting to his original name, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lydon </PERSON>, and forming <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Image </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which had a danceable sound that drew upon a wide variety of music. <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Image </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> has been more durable, if less exciting, than The <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pistols </ORGANIZATION>, and has just released `` 9,'' its ninth album. The current lineup consists of <PERSON> Lydon </PERSON>, guitarist ish folk culture. Irish folk music does relate very much to Bulgarian, which relates to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which relates to the Arab, all the way around, going into <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, back up through <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> again. Marvelous.'' The Sex Pistols: `` It got very, very stale and I had to call it quits. It was the Pistols then, it's Public Image now. I always offer an alternative.'' The film `` <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>,'' which depicted the life of Sex Pistols bassist <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicious </PERSON>: `` To be misrepresented so badly was a great disappointment. -LRB- Director -RRB- <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> never communicated with any of the Pistols, not even the manager at that time, none of us. So how on earth can you present that film as a semi-documentary? `` It was like ` Fantasy Island' gone wrong. How can you use someone like <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Strummer </PERSON> and Iggy Pop as research. What do they know about the workings of the Pistols? Nothing. You might as well have asked ... Liberace and probably would have achieved better results.'' Performing drunk: `` I put that down to inexperience. Not having respect for myself. Going on stage drunk is a tragedy. I did do that a few times because I was so bloody nervous. The end result was a shambles. `` Apologies, folks, for those bad old days but there were n't too many of them.'' Non-violence: `` If you want to destroy a government, it's very easy. Just lay down your tools, all at once. The country will collapse overnight. `` The minute you have to kill people for a cause, you have no cause. You immediately show you have no respect for human life. There's no real need for it. We can change this planet, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> proved that.'' Failure: `` Before every gig, I'm absolutely terrified, completely. I want every show to be the ultimate. Once I'm on, then I'm fine, you know, home run. But that buildup _ bloody dreadful.'' Music video: `` I've had some wonderful fantasies in my life. I envisioned myself as operating this video company. I realized after three weeks I loathed video. I can not stand it. I do n't like watching it. These are Polaroids, they're trivial. I do n't like fiddling about with cameras.'' Lyrics: `` People do n't actually listen to the songs they're dancing to. ... I had to listen to every single word used. I just liked language. It's our major achievement as a species.'' Songwriting: `` On a lot of my songs, I just sit down and write it, line after line after line. I keep running the ideas through my head and finally the best way of doing it just occurs to me quite naturally.'' His Public Image bandmates: `` If you ca n't get on with people, there's no point. I do n't care about looks, I care about personality, some sense of musical innovation. I'm not interested in some sort of manufactured pop or set, organized musical things, that bores me.'' <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>'s hair: `` You ca n't tell me that's not a wig! You can see it on the back of his head. Most wig manufacturers are pretty sophisticated, but <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> is n't!'' Imitators: `` Do n't imitate me. Do n't ever imitate me. That would not be a form of flattery at all. That would be worse than being in a heavy metal band.''

<HEAD>Woman Starts National Campaign for Bittering Compound in Poisons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 What <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> wants to put in household products would make you gag. Literally. The 33-year-old mother of two has launched a campaign to add the world's bitterest substance _ the <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Records </ORGANIZATION> says it is _ to garden sprays, antifreeze, window cleaner and other poisons. The goal is to make them so bitter children will immediately spit them out. `` I figured I should taste it to tell people how bad it is,'' <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> said. `` It really made my mouth feel like a place where old spiders go to die. I went around for weeks spitting. I looked like I played major league baseball. My mom thought I'd taken up chewing tobacco.'' Her crusade began Feb. 6 when she heard on the radio that the compound known as denatonium benzoate, generally sold under the trademark Bitrex, is put into poisonous materials in <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Bittering compounds also are used in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and are required by law in antifreeze in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and pesticide in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a few products, such as Bold and Solo liquid detergents and Sterno fuel, contain it. The free-lance writer took her 5-year-old son and 3-month-old daughter to the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> library to find out more. It was three weeks before she found an article on the substance discovered 30 years ago by <ORGANIZATION> McFarlan-Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and used generally to denature alcohol. `` I tried writing manufacturers and got no good response, and I got nothing from the politicians,'' she said. `` They sent me form letters saying ` Thank you for the input. Do n't forget to vote for me in the next election.' I thought, ` I'm going to have to demonstrate that people care about this ...' `` I wrote to about 20 of the big newspapers, then I wrote to consumer groups, magazines, health magazines, insurance magazines, the people I thought would pick it up.'' <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> and about 20 Albany-area women formed <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Proof </ORGANIZATION>, which has gotten thousands of letters of support. `` I call it a leverage blackmail opportunity. I can take pictures of me with the letters and send them to the manufacturers. Now I'm not just <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> causing trouble, I'm <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> with the force of X-number of people causing trouble.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> has called on manufacturers to use <LOCATION> Bitrex </LOCATION> in all appropriate products. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, called <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> to say he would introduce a bill to require a bittering compound in all poisonous liquid consumer products. `` It is really kicking interest up to a new level,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Montvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributor of <LOCATION> Bitrex </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> said the bittering compound would cost less than a half-cent per pint and would augment the use of child-proof containers. Sixty-five percent of child-proof containers sent to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> failed to withstand children's attempts to open them, she said. But most manufacturers do n't want to draw attention to the dangerousness of their products, and say there's no demand for the bittering agent, she said. <PERSON> Bitrex </PERSON> has been used in Solo since 1981 and in Bold since 1985 because for some unknown reason children seem more susceptible to drnking those products, said <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. It is n't used in other products because there has been no serious problem, <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` Our safety record with our detergents is pristine.'' If consumer demand is strong enough, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> will study the matter further, she said. `` On the other hand, we do n't want people to let down their guard about proper storage and usage of these products just because we put a Bitrex-safe concept across the front of them.'' Detergents include substances that make people who swallow them vomit, she said, adding that such household goods are n't as big a danger as poisons such as antifreeze and herbicides. <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which manufactures the <ORGANIZATION> Ortho </ORGANIZATION> line of herbicides and pesticides, does not use the bittering agent. `` The primary reason that we did n't end up using it is that all of our lawn and garden products are already in child-resistant containers,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Sherri </PERSON> <PERSON> Zippay </PERSON>. The company considered using Bitrex in snail and slug bait to protect pets, <PERSON> Zippay </PERSON> said. `` But snails would n't eat it then, either.'' <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> does n't want this to be a personal crusade. She's uncomfortable, with the individual attention she's been getting `` I did n't do anything any other mother would n't have done. I was just the first person that saw it. It takes one spark to start a forest fire. I was just the spark. Once the fire started, it does n't matter who got the thing going. Each year, `` I take up one cause because every year there's at least one thing that aggravates me and I follow it through until it's taken care of. Last year, it was property taxes. The tax judge did agree with me, finally.'' Still, <PERSON> Tylczak </PERSON> does n't accept the title of consumer activist. `` I'm just an angry mother.''

<HEAD>Spider Silk Studied as Source of Strong Fibers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In research that could provide new materials for high-strength cables, bulletproof vests and sutures, scientists have turned to one of the most delicate-looking fibers in nature: silk spun by spiders. Researchers want to learn more about the gossamer threads because they offer an apparently unique combination of great stretchability and strength. Some day, scientists hope, spider genes will be customized to produce silks with characteristics most needed for various uses, maybe even clothing. Spiders themselves customize their silk. A spider may produce half a dozen kinds for a variety of jobs, each silk coming from a different gland. Several kinds are used in webs. Another, called dragline silk, is what spiders use to dangle from the ceiling. Still another is used to make a cocoon for eggs. In contrast, silkworms spin only one kind of silk, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Natick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Some spider silk is nearly as strong as <PERSON> Kevlar </PERSON>, a synthetic fiber used in bulletproof vests, said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, head of the molecular biology department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Laramie </LOCATION>. To snap a dangling 12-inch piece of dragline silk, for example, it is estimated that one would have to hang another piece of silk from it approximately 10,000 miles long. Much of the work so far has focused on the dragline silk of the golden orb-weaver. Found in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the spider is named for its yellowish webs, which can be up to six feet wide. <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lombardi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON> have determined the detailed chemical makeup of the dragline silk, and are using that information to seek the gene that directs production of the silk. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, whose work is supported by the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, believes he has found the gene. He is now determining its chemical details. Finding a silk gene is important because researchers can then insert it in bacteria or some other organism that can churn out the protein that makes up the silk far faster than spiders do. That will allow further study of the protein, to find out why it is so stretchable and why it has other properties of interest. Knowing the gene should also allow scientists to alter it someday so that the resulting silk will perform better in particular applications. One possibility is lightweight but strong fiberglass-like materials, which might be useful for aircraft skin, helmets and other applications, <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> said. Another potential use is sutures, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said. Spider silk appears not to provoke an immune-system reaction from the body, and it contracts when moist, which could keep stitches snug during the healing process. Still another possibility, if it can be produced cheaply enough, is clothing. Apart from being as supple as regular silk and more elastic, spider silk has an `` incredible sheen to it, almost a metallic sheen'' that suggests mother-of-pearl, <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said.

 A broken filling, loose crown, or painful, chipped or fractured tooth sends most people running to their dentist. But what do you do if you're on vacation without nearby dental care? `` No homemade remedy can ever substitute for the professional attention of a qualified dentist,'' said dentist <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>. `` In a pinch, though, when you have no alternative, these helpful hints might come in handy.'' _ For a broken filling, rub the cavity with clove oil Do n't fill it with candle wax or chewing gum. _ A bonding compound able to hold a loose crown in place for a day can be made by mixing petroleum jelly and flour _ Take aspirin, acetaminophen or another aspirin substitute for toothaches If you have swelling as well as pain, rinse your mouth regularly with salt water. Apply an ice pack, or even a cold can of soda. Do n't apply aspirin directly to the tooth because it can permanently damage the nerve. _ Rinse your mouth with warm water if you chip or break a tooth Do n't try to file the tooth, and do n't use glue to try to save it. _ Use wet gauze immediately to wrap a tooth that has been knocked out Get to a dentist quickly and it might be saved.

<HEAD>Body's Attempt to Fend Off Malaria Apparently Triggers Symptoms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Anemia, the loss of red blood cells that can kill people who suffer malaria, is largely caused by the body's attempt to defend itself against the infectious disease, research on mice suggests The <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> study indicates overstimulation of part of the immune system also is partly responsible for other malaria symptoms, like death of kidney tissue, clogging of blood vessels in the brain, and eventual suppression of the immune system. The discovery could lead to better understanding of malaria and a new treatment against it: use of antibodies against the `` tumor necrosis factor,'' or TNF, that helps cause the anemia and other symptoms, researchers said. At least 100 million new cases of malaria are reported annually, and about 1.5 million victims die each year. The disease, which destroys vital red blood cells, is caused by a parasite called <LOCATION> Plasmodium </LOCATION>. The female Anopheles mosquito carries the parasite in its saliva. TNF is produced in the body to hel defend against disease and promote healing, and is being used as an experimental anti-cancer therapy. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and other <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkeley </PERSON> scientists showed that anemia in malaria can be mostly reversed by giving infected mice an antibody against TNF. The study also suggests TNF may play a role in causing chronic anemia seen in patients with other infectious diseases and certain cancers, <PERSON> Silverman </PERSON> said. Malaria-causing parasites also destroy red blood cells, but previous studies found that such destruction alone fails to explain the severity and extent of anemia in malaria patients. Earlier studies also found that another immune system chemical, interleukin-1, plays a role in causing anemia in those patients. The studies may explain why giving infected mice antibodies against <ORGANIZATION> TNF </ORGANIZATION> failed to completely reverse the loss of red blood cells.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> plans to help crews prepare for flat tires and other problems landing the space shuttle by having an astronaut fly an armor-plated aircraft to test shuttle landing gear. During next year's tests, the Convair CV-990 jet will touch down on its own landing gear at 225 mph, then lower shuttle landing gear mounted between its main tires, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` We intend to do a whole series of tests and use different pressures in the shuttle tire, taking the pressure down to where we actually destroy the tire,'' <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said. Because the Convair's landing gear will support the plane, there is no danger to veteran shuttle astronaut <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON>, who will fly it, she added The test landings will be conducted on paved and dry lakebed runways at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>, on paved runways at Kennedy Space Center, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and on unpaved landing strips at White Sands Space Harbor, N.M. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the tests `` will give engineers information on what to expect should an orbiter experience a flat tire or other anomalies on landing, and will provide data to help in developing crew procedures for various landing conditions and situations.'' The agency required all space shuttles to land at Edwards since April 1985, when Discovery blew a tire and sustained brake damage landing on a paved runway at Kennedy Space Center. The shuttle swerved down the runway, but was never out of control and the astronauts emerged safely. Landing gear and brakes have been modified, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> continues to test them during shuttle landings at <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>. To prepare the CV-990 for the 1990 test landings, `` we'll armor plate the belly of the airplane so that if there's debris kicked up, it wo n't damage the bottom of the aircraft,'' <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> will test brakes and nose gear steering, along with the main and nose landing gear, wheel and tire assemblies.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The National Black Women's Health Project is no clinic. It's a place where women tell what ails them and hugs are the order of the day. From a rambling, tree-shaded mansion in southwest <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, dozens of ladies set about healing bodies by healing attitudes, heightening health awareness for a nation of women who often pay a heavy physical price just living every day. `` If you are living in a house where you are being abused sexually, physically, emotionally, that is what's on the front of your mind. You could n't get too excited about your health,'' said executive director <PERSON> Byllye </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>. Black women are twice as likely as whites to die of diabetes, three times as likely to die of cervical cancer and 18 times as likely to have organ damage due to hypertension, the project says. In addition, 75 percent of female AIDS victims are black, and nearly half of all black women are mothers by age 20. Black women also are three times as likely to be molested or raped and four times as likely to be murdered, <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. The project's main goal is to `` break the conspiracy of silence'' surrounding women's health. With shared experiences, newsletters and films, the project works in the hope that education will pull black women away from social evils that inhibit efforts to seek birth control and better nutrition. Every month, the project stages programs on topics such as `` Mothers Too Early Too Long,'' which gathered four generations of teen mothers to discuss how pregnancy affected their lives; `` Black & amp; Female: What Is The Reality?'' about social issues that affect black women; and `` SisterReach,'' which dealt with women's health issues in <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, a tiny Central American nation. The project also operates a Wellness Center, providing tutorial and literacy programs, out of an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> housing project. `` We create a safe space where sisters can say whatever they need to say,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. `` Where sisters have someone listen to them, and also have someone struggle with them.'' And the women come. They laugh and talk. They bring their daughters. The teen-agers deal with such topics as `` Growing Up Is Scary'' and `` What Is A Real Man?'' putting their thoughts in a newsletter. `` What we stress is coming together and taking the risk to start talking openly with each other about the realities of our lives,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. `` It's through that analysis that women then learn what to do about certain parts of their health. It helps break down the alienation and isolation that black women feel.'' The project was launched at <ORGANIZATION> Spelman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in June 1983, during a conference on black women's health issues. Planners expected 200 to 300 women; nearly 2,000 showed up. `` We knew then there was a need among the sisters to organize around health,'' <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> said. `` Before us, nobody even knew the words ` black women's health issues.'

<HEAD>U.S. Rejects Criticism of Trade Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official has rejected criticism from negotiators in world trade talks that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy undermined efforts to liberalize international trade. Delegates at a special meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade condemned provisions in the 1988 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade act which call for penalties against countries deemed to be especially protectionist. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON>, director-general of the 96-nation organization, issued an appeal Wednesday that governments should not take action outside <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>'s international trade rules as unilateral measures had been tried before and failed, the spokesman said. Deputy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Yerxa </PERSON> told the special closed session of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> council that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` would not apologize for actions taken in trying to pursue its trade objectives,'' and said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was committed to the current four-year round of global trade-freeing talks, according to a partial text of his speech released to journalists. But <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ambassador <PERSON> Tran </PERSON> <PERSON> Van-Thinh </PERSON> warned in the closed meeting of the possible `` sinking of the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> because of an error of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judgment,'' a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. Last month the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration singled out <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for priority action under the so-called 301 section of its trade act because of alleged serious violations against fair trade. The three countries face 100 percent tariffs on selected exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if they do not remove the offending barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods within 18 months. <PERSON> Yerxa </PERSON> told the meeting Wednesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had taken no action under the new procedure other than `` to identify trade liberalizing priorities'' in areas which are `` significant barriers to world trade.'' Arguing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` remarkably open'' in the face of a huge trade deficit, he said that 60 percent of all Third World exports of manufactured goods go to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, twice as many as the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and five times as many as <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> received. <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> ambassador <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricupero </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action `` undermines and puts in jeopardy the whole <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION>,'' and `` has already wasted and ruined the precious capital of goodwill'' built up during the talks. Indian representative <PERSON> Bal </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zutshi </PERSON> said the implementation of the 301 provisions would `` emasculate the multilateral trading system.'' Japanese ambassador <PERSON> Joshio </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatano </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> disregard of the system within the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> for settling trade disputes. `` To be judge, jury and executioner at the same time is not acceptable,'' he told the meeting. Copies of the texts from the Brazilian, Japanese and Indian were made available to journalists. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said that <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON> told the meeting that <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> had been established in 1948 after `` unilateralism and bilateralism had been tried and failed.'' <PERSON> Dunkel </PERSON> told the meeting if the drafters of the founding agreement were still alive, `` they would have asked in despair, do world economic relations have to go through the same cycle again? Can the present generation of trade policy makers not learn from the experiences of a previous one?'' the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Government Allows Boeing 737-400 Jets To Fly With Power Curb</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> has lifted its grounding order on 12 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 jets operated by British airlines as long as modifications are made to cut the engines' power. The planes were grounded nine days ago after two incidents in which 737-400s were forced to make emergency landings because fan blades broke in their CFM 56-3C engines. The engines are manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it was imposing power cuts that effectively lower the engines' thrust to that of a previous generation of the make. Airlines were also ordered to replace the engines' fan blades and discs. Regular visual inspections of fan blades and the front face of the engine discs will also be required, the <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> said. The spokesman, speaking anonymously, said airlines were already making the modifications and some 737-400s could be back in operation on Thursday. The grounding order was made after fan blades broke on a <ORGANIZATION> DanAir </ORGANIZATION> jet at <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on June 9 and on a British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> aircraft at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on June 11. Fan blade problems were also thought to have contributed to the engine failure which led to the crash in January of a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> 737-400 near <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Leicestershire </LOCATION>, killing 47. The <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> had originally said it did not believe that lowering the engines' power would solve the problem. But a <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the agency had been convinced by tests showing the fan blade failure occurred at a certain level of thrust. `` We are putting the clock back to the previous standard and we are satisfied that restores the necessary safety margin,'' he said. British airlines using 737-400s said they had managed to keep flying on schedule by using spare aircraft or borrowing replacements. In addition to British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and DanAir, 737-400s are operated by <PERSON> Novair </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Europe </ORGANIZATION> and Air UK-Leisure.

<HEAD>FDIC Chairman: More Institutions Will Fail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Though the savings and loan bailout bill now in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will go far toward eliminating the likelihood of another S & amp; L debacle, dozens more thrifts will fail before the measure become law, says the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Institutions will have to be closed. People will lose their jobs. Defaulting borrowers will be sued,'' <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said Wednesday in a speech to financial journalists in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Large amounts of property will be sold in difficult markets. And, of course, the taxpayers will bear the burden through future taxes,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> has taken control of 223 savings and loans in the last few months at the request of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. `` We expect that number to increase to almost 300 by the time the president signs the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bill,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said he expects President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will sign the new bailout bill by August. The measure is aimed at correcting the mistakes of the last decade, he said. However, one thing that has yet to be addressed is the industry's interest-rate mismatching, where S & amp; Ls essentially borrow short but lend long in fixed-rate mortgages, and where the cost of loaning money is higher than the interest paid on savings Bills already passed in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> require stronger capital for <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls based on standards used for banks. They also call for factual accounting, `` rather than the ill-fated ` smoke and mirrors' of the past,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. In addition, they call for double supervision of S & amp; Ls, with the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> serving as the backup supervisor for the industry, and for creation of a comprehensive vehicle called the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to handle insolvent S & amp; Ls. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> may play a role in operating the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, which he said may have to handle about $ 400 billion in assets from failed institutions. `` To give you a view of the size of the job, the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> in its entire existence has dealt with about $ 160 billion in assets,'' he said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> also said that banks are continuing to fail at a high rate. So far this year, 96 banks have failed or required government assistance, about the same number as in 1988. The <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> expects 150 to 180 bank failures in 1989, down from last year's post-Depression record of 221, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. The prediction, he said, was based on a decline in the number of `` problem banks'' to 1,282 now compared with a high of 1,624 in June 1987. But <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> predicted there would be a dramatic drop in the amount of bank assets and deposits handled by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We anticipate handling about $ 10 billion of assets in 1989, or about 12 percent of what we handled last year,'' he said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> reiterated that the S & amp; L rescue will be the costliest financial bailout in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history _ more than the `` Marshall Plan, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> bailouts all combined, and by a mile.'' `` In fact, it will probably cost every man, woman and child in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> about $ 1,000 each,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fed Seeks to Erode Barrier Between Banks and Securities Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> has taken took a step that could result in the further erosion of the 56-year-old barrier between commercial banking and the securities business. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> asked Wednesday for public comment on a proposal to permit subsidiaries of bank holding companies to double the amount of securities business they conduct. Since the 1933 passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, which was enacted after the 1929 stock market crash rippled into a banking crisis, banks have been prohibited from being `` principally engaged'' in underwriting securities. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has interpreted that clause as allowing holding company subsidiaries to engage in securities underwriting up to 5 percent of their revenue. The agency is considering doubling the loophole to 10 percent and asked for comment on that by July 20. Both moves are likely to displease leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Banking committees, which view changes in the Glass-Steagall Act as requiring congressional, not regulatory, action. Congressional banking leaders have promised to begin considering Glass-Steagall reform soon after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> enacts President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s savings and loan bailout Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, strongly protested a <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decision in January that added corporate bond underwriting to the list of securities activities open to banks. This week, <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> became the first bank given final permission to start exercising that power. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> also has said that early next year it will begin considering opening corporate stock underwriting to banks.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, citing financial hardships in living on his $ 82,500-a-year government salary, says he will resign as one of the seven members of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. An expert in international economics, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said Wednesday he would return to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to become an executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the giant credit card company. In a meeting with reporters, he refused to disclose his exact salary at <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION>, saying only that it would be a `` pretty sizable'' increase that would represent a multiple of his government pay. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> specifically cited <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' rejection earlier this year of a proposed federal pay raise as one factor in his decision to leave. Under the proposal, which would have boosted congressional salaries as well as those of top officials, the pay of a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> governor would have risen to $ 125,000. His resignation will give President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> his first opportunity to appoint someone to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The other six members, including Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, were appointed by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Economists said it was unlikely <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>'s surprise departure would affect policy at the central bank. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> generally espoused supply-side monetary views emphasizing economic growth, appearing at times to be at odds with the tough anti-inflation leanings of former Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Volcker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who early in the year complained that the central bank was risking a recession by a too-tight money policy, was likely to appoint a replacement very close to <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>'s philosophy, analysts predicted. `` I would expect the appointment will be someone who is at least as dovish on inflation as <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> was,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The replacement by law must come from a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> regional bank district not now represented on the board. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> came from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> region, which will now be vacant. Other regions not now represented on the board are <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> joined the board in August 1986 and his replacement will fill a term that lasts until Jan. 31, 1996. In his resignation letter, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> said he was leaving for `` personal considerations.'' He told reporters he had taken a significant pay cut to join the government and that with two children approaching college age he found that `` financially, it gets tougher and tougher.'' Before joining the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Heller </PERSON> served as a senior vice president and director of international economic research for <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and is a naturalized <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen, said the <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION> job offered him the chance to return to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and to use his international experience in dealing with <ORGANIZATION> Visa </ORGANIZATION>'s operations in 185 countries. <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, 49, was generally recognized as the international expert on the board and several economists said they expected that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would take that and ideological considerations into consideration when choosing a replacement. `` I think the White House would want somebody ... willing to ensure that economic growth is maintained at some expense on the inflation front,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>House Democrat Offers Alternative Minimum Wage Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A House Democrat has proposed raising the minimum wage to $ 4.25 by next year, but his attempt at breaking an impasse between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contains provisions the White House has insisted it wo n't accept. Rep. <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, D-Pa., introduced a revised minimum-wage bill Wednesday, a week after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed legislation that would have raised the wage from $ 3.35 an hour to $ 4.55 by 1991 The House last week was unable to override the veto, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s first. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee with jurisdiction over the minimum wage, proposed raising the hourly minimum wage to $ 3.80 on Oct. 1 and to $ 4.25 a year later. His final target matches that of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, although the minimum wage would not reach $ 4.25 an hour until January 1992 under the president's proposal. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s proposal gave no ground on the issue on which the majority Democrats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have their greatest difference _ whether employers should be allowed to pay newly hired workers a subminimum wage for an initial training period. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will not support any increase in the minimum wage unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also establishes a new subminimum wage employers could pay all new workers for up to six months. Democrats intially resisted any attempts to establish a subminimum wage, but eventually included in the measure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed a provision allowing the lower wage to be paid to workers with fewer than 60 days' work experience. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> included the same 60-day provision in his bill. `` I reject the president's call for a six-month training wage, mainly because it is excessive and unfair,'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said in a statement. Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., has re-introduced legislation in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> identical to the measure <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed, but has indicated a willingness to discuss a compromise with the White House Administration officials have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal is the only acceptable one.

<HEAD>Eastern Asks Court to Cut Pilot Pay, Increase Work Hours</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> attorney says the carrier's move to end its contract with striking pilots and cut wages is a matter of economics, but the pilots union says it reflects management's anti-labor attitude `` The albatross around <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s neck is not labor costs, but an inept and rapacious management,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement late Wednesday. Eastern on Wednesday asked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to terminate the contract its pilots had been working under before the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union in March led a massive work stoppage that crippled the airline. The Miami-based carrier also is seeking approval for a permanent increase in the number of hours a pilot may work each month and about $ 50 million in temporary wage and benefit concessions. `` This is not a union-busting tactic,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` This is an economic problem.'' Eastern officials said the new conditions are supported by pilots who have continued to fly during the strike and are similar to cuts taken by management and other non-union employees during the 3-month-old strike. The pilots union said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s actions came as no surprise. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> `` is following basically the same pattern of harsh treatment for workers that he established when he took <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy and abrogated its labor contracts there in 1983,'' <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION>'s statement said <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> abrogated union contracts with employees of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, after he put <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> into bankruptcy protection. The carrier, based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, is now non-union. But the pilots union said Wednesday it expects <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> to have a `` much more difficult time'' doing the same with <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tightened the bankruptcy laws after the Continental episode to make it harder for companies to cancel contracts through bankruptcy reorganization. Now a company must show it is negotiating in good faith. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> sought termination of the pilots' contract, which expired a year ago, in order to move ahead with rebuilding plans because the union had balked at negotiating a new contract. Eastern had about 3,600 pilots before the strike, but plans to rebuild into a smaller carrier with about 1,700 pilots. Under Section 1113 of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Code, the court has 14 to 21 days to schedule a hearing and 30 days to rule on <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request Eastern is seeking to cut the pilots' pay by 10 percent for six months, 5 percent for the next six months and to delay vacations until next year. Wage and pension-plan concessions would be restored by half on Jan. 31, 1990, and in full by August 1990. The airline also is asking for permanent work rule changes. The airline wants to be able to schedule pilots to fly 68 hours a month in 1990 and 60 hours a month thereafter, compared with the pre-strike 46 hours. Federal regulations allow a pilot to fly an average of 85 hours a month, with a maximum of 100 hours. The Machinists went on strike March 4 after federal mediation failed. The pilots' contract is still open to negotiation and normally would have to go through federal mediation, but <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the airline can seek to end the contract because the company is in Chapter 11.

 The strongest <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> dissident movement in 40 years has lost a seat on the union's executive board, but the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership may be hearing more from the New Directions group <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> was defeated for re-election Wednesday as director of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> 5 in eight south-central states, losing to <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and New Directions have criticized <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> for allegedly stifling dissent within the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> and losing sight of the 1 million-member union's roots by making to cooperative labor agreements with automakers. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and members of his <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> have denied the charges. But the New Directions effort has gained widespread rank-and-file support and is the most serious challenge to the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership since the mid-1940s, when <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuther </PERSON> was solidifying control of the then-fledgling union After the regional director election, one <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Directions </ORGANIZATION> member asked <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> to set aside the entire vote and hold another election within two months. That brought catcalls and mild obscenities from <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> supporters. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> ruled the motion out of order. On his way out of the caucus, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuther </PERSON>, brother of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Reuther </PERSON> and a backer of <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s efforts, said a similar motion could be brought before the convention today. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> had little to say immediately after the loss, other than that he had not decided about whether he would take the election challenge to court. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was chosen director of Region 5 in a federally supervised election Sept. 1, 1988, after he challenged an earlier election in court. He lost that contest by an extremely narrow margin. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>, appointed by <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> as an assistant director in Region 5 three years ago, said after his election that union members `` saw through the New Directions movement. They saw they had questions but no answers. `` I think it's the beginning of the end for the New Directions movement,'' he said. <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> said he would try to reconcile the two camps in his huge region. But, he added: `` It will take a while. There are some scars out there that need to be healed.'' That was evident in the packed hotel room where the caucus was held. Both sides wore jackets with their candidates' names on the back _ <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s forces in blue and <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>'s in white. Earlier Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION>'s slate of top union officers was elected to three-year terms without opposition. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> won his third term as the union's president. Incumbent Secretary-Treasurer <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Casstevens </PERSON> was elected to a full term after succeeding the late <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Majerus </PERSON>, who died Jan. 14, 1988. Delegates also elected four vice presidents _ two incumbents and two to succeed the retiring <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> will assign responsibilities to his new vice presidents. It's expected that <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON> will move from the union's <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to head the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, succeeding <PERSON> Ephlin </PERSON>; newly elected vice president <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lofton </PERSON> will succeed <PERSON> Yokich </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, also elected as vice president Wednesday, will follow <PERSON> Stepp </PERSON> as director of the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Vice President <PERSON> Odessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kommer </PERSON>, the union's most senior vice president having been elected first in 1974, probably will keep many of her responsibilities, including oversight of the union's relations with a number of automotive supplier companies

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has gone to court to block <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s proposed $ 14 billion buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But a cable operator that is 82 percent-owned by <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> is running into opposition from local officials over its own plans to acquire the operator's cable franchises in connection with a hostile $ 10.7 billion bid for Time. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to investigate Time's bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> on the ground that the companies may have violated exchange rules. The exchange said it would comply with the request. Those were among the developments Wednesday in what is shaping up as a fiercely contested takeover battle that could produce one of the world's largest communications companies no matter who wins. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> rose $ 4.75 a share to $ 157.25 on Wednesday after losing $ 19 in the previous three sessions. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> fell $ 1 a share to $ 58.50 while <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> lost 12 -LCB- cents a share to $ 59.25. Paramount filed a 49-page amendment to an earlier suit in <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday in which it said Time acted improperly in rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout offer and launching its own takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. The complaint said the offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> `` amounts to a multibillion dollar abuse of Time's stockholders for the purpose of protecting the secure and prosperous future of Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> management.'' Paramount also asked that the court nullify results of the upcoming election of four Time board members. Time's chairman and chief executive, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>, and its president, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, are nominees. Paramount said the pending election is a sham because no opposing candidates have been nominated. In response to the amended complaint, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s allegations were without merit. Time said it would `` respond to the complaint in the proper forum _ <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ and demonstrate clearly its position and the merits of its case.'' In its amendment to the suit, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> also claimed that a stock swap recently completed between Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> violated <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> rules that require shareholder approval for such a transaction. If the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> finds that Time or <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had violated its rules, it could bar the merged company from trading its shares on the exchange. A hearing on <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s suit is set for July 11. Paramount, an entertainment and publishing concern, launched a $ 175 a share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s stock on June 6, only 2 -LCB- weeks before Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders originally were to vote on a merger of the companies. Time, a leading magazine and book publisher and cable programmer and operator, rejected <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s offer Friday, saying it was inadequate and highly conditional and that securing regulatory approvals for cable system transfers alone would take a year or more. Time also said it had revised its merger agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to provide a $ 70-a-share buyout of the movie, record and cable concern. While shareholder approval was needed for the original merger, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders are not being asked to vote on the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. Meanwhile, the cable operator <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday local opposition is growing to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s plans for acquiring cable franchises associated with Time. <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, has said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s acquisition of Time is illegal because the change in control would place <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> in violation of many of its cable franchise agreements. It said officials from the states of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and 16 cities including <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> have complained to federal officials that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover plan abrogates the local right of prior approval for cable franchise ownership in their areas. <ORGANIZATION> ATC </ORGANIZATION> also said that Paramount has indicated in a court filing in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> that it wo n't meet the July 5 deadline set in its tender offer for Time. Asked for a response, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said it intends to extend the expiration date of its tender offer until after the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court decision. Paramount also said it expects to get cable franchise approval `` where required by state and local law in an orderly and expeditious way.'' In its amended complaint in the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> court, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> argues that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s management `` launched a massive campaign to block the Paramount offer'' before <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s board made its public statement on the merits of the offer. The complaint said that before the board acted, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> wrote to at least 22 state attorneys general, urging them to oppose any action by Paramount to get quick approval of its offer. Paramount said Time failed in moving the date of its annual meeting to June 30 from June 23 to adjust the May 1 record date for eligibility to vote, even though the company acknowledged that a large number of shares have since changed hands. It also noted the meeting will not deal with any aspect of the <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger plan but only election of directors, who are unopposed. `` The board's action make one thing clear: Time is being run solely for the benefit of its management,'' the suit said.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar fell in early trading today against all European currencies and the Japanese yen. Gold prices were higher, moving up on the dollar's weakness. Traders said they were puzzled by the dollar's direction. `` We're all trying to determine what kind of consolidation phase this is. It does n't fit any of the patterns,'' said one analyst in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. `` Frequent reversals and sharp rallies are both possible,'' said another analyst in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>.

 The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today, while the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s main index fell slightly. The dollar closed at 141.40 yen, down 3.55 yen from Wednesday's close of 144.95 yen It opened at 141.75 yen, its high for the day, and fell as low as 140.35 yen. It was the dollar's lowest close since 140.65 yen on June 5. It had climbed to 151.30 a week ago. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 20.31 points, or 0.06 percent, ending at 33,324.97. The index, a 111.81-point gainer the previous day, inched up in early trading today, then turned downward. <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON>, a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, said the market lost energy and became directionless after its early gains. `` Following last week's large losses, the market's energy has not come back yet,'' he said. Affected by large swings in the dollar-yen exchange rate, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> lost more than 1,100 points last week. Most investors retreated to the sidelines in the afternoon session, making trading thin, <PERSON> Ishizuka </PERSON> said. Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 550 million shares, down from Wednesday's 600 million. On the foreign exchange market, traders said expectations for a higher dollar had disappeared after its sharp downswing in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> overnight, triggered by reports of new government efforts to hold it below 140 yen. <PERSON> Masafumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Koyama </PERSON>, an analyst with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, said any rumors or remarks suggesting a lower dollar could be a strong dollar-selling incentive now. `` A majority of Japanese investors sold the dollar, trying to see how far they could push it down to reach an appropriate dollar-yen rate,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> reportedly sold dollars to help push the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency down, but neither the amount nor the intervention itself had been confirmed, <PERSON> Koyama </PERSON> said. `` The market took the central bank action as showing its intention to eventually push the dollar below the 140 yen mark,'' he said. <PERSON> Koyama </PERSON> said it still was too early to determine the market trend. `` That's why many investors have been avoiding major moves, and just making position adjustments,'' he added.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may not have envisioned such a summit, but his clean-air proposals have the Big Three automakers talking to each other. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have been discussing ways to beat Japanese and European competitors to market with cleaner-running cars, but have not decided whether to collaborate in their efforts. `` I do n't know if that's possible or not,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s Automotive Reports said Wednesday it would report in its upcoming edition that the big <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers might seek an antitrust waiver for research on emissions controls, alternate fuels and fuel economy steps to meet new regulations proposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> granted an antitrust exemption under the National Cooperative Research Act for joint research begun by the Big Three in 1988 on composite materials, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON>'s said in a news release. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> confirmed that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> executives met to talk about environmental and energy questions. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poling </PERSON> hosted the June 6 meeting in <LOCATION> Dearborn </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwald </PERSON> attended, he said. `` It was a discussion of everyone's points of view on subjects which have been made public in recent congressional testimony,'' the spokesman said.

 As automakers adopt inflatable air bags as a means of meeting tighter requirements for safety restraints, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will install driver's - side air bags on all its About 1 million <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> cars will have the devices in the coming model year, the No. 3 automaker said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said driver's - side air bags will be standard on 15 of its 1990 car lines, or about <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it will install them on nine major lines, an expected 1 million cars. `` Part of it is meeting the passive restraint requirements,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said, adding that company surveys show safety is a top concern among customers. In addition to air bags, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is equipping 17 of its U.S.-built 1990 models with rear-seat lap and shoulder belts rather than just lap belts. The automaker also will offer antilock braking systems on 26 of its more than 30 car and truck lines in 1990, he said. Starting in 1990, federal regulations require front-seat passive restraints in cars, comprising either manual safety belts supplemented by driver's - side air bags or passive belt systems, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> Passive restraints do n't require an action such as buckling a seat belt. Passive belt systems are partly anchored to the car door so the belt wraps around the occupant when the door is closed. By 1993, air bag protection or passive belts will be required for front seat passengers as well as drivers, <PERSON> Simonetti </PERSON> said. Passenger-side air bags are in the works but are harder to design, she and <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` The driver is in a fixed position, plus you have a natural home for the air bag in the steering wheel assembly,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. `` On the passenger side you have to engineer it to travel a greater distance, and you do n't know what position the passenger might be in.''

<HEAD>Anti-Takeover Plan Enacted at Disney</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has adopted a `` poison pill'' anti-takeover defense but says it does not know of any prospective bids for the company. The plan adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors and announced Wednesday would entitle present stockholders to buy new stock at half price in the event of a hostile takeover attempt. Such plans dilute the holdings of a potential buyer, making a buyout without management consent prohibitively expensive. The plan is similar to those adopted at many <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations in recent years, and has been under consideration at Disney for several months, said spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON>. `` It was not as a result of anything that has happened in the last several weeks,'' <PERSON> Deegan </PERSON> said. He was referring to the three-way buyout battle among <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and to a trend toward consolidation of media giants. `` While we are not aware of any effort to acquire control of the company, the stockholder rights plan represents a sound and reasonable means of safeguarding the interests of all stockholders,'' <PERSON> Disney </PERSON> said in a news release.

<HEAD>Economy Grew at 4.4 Percent Pace in First Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Combines pvs files; trims at bottom to shorten</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at an annual rate of 4.4 percent in the first three months of the year, slightly better than previously believed, the government reported today. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said more than half the growth in the gross national product came from a rebound from last summer's drought, a one-time boost that is more of a reflection of the government's accounting methods than a measurement of the real economy Discounting the bookkeeping entry to return expected farm production this year to its pre-drought levels, growth actually slowed dramatically in the January-March quarter. The non-farm economy grew at a sluggish annual rate of 1.9 percent, compared with a 3.5 percent rate in the final three months of 1988. This slowdown is in line with many economists' expectations. Private analysts predict the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy will slow dramatically this year under the impact of an anti-inflation campaign waged by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The central bank in March 1988 began to drive interest rates higher in an effort to dampen demand. The new GNP report contained some good news on the inflation front as a GNP price index rose at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, down from a preliminary estimate of 5 percent a month ago. The increase in the GNP price index that measures a fixed marketbasket of goods was up only slightly from a 4.2 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1988. The government said the downward revision came from slower price increases for farm products and industrial supplies than earlier estimated. Many analysts are predicting that overall growth will slow this year to what is known as a growth recession, a period when the economy keeps expanding but at such a sluggish pace that unemployment rises. Some economists believe that is already occurring. After falling to a 15-year low in March, the unemployment rate has risen to 5.2 percent, with job growth dropping in May to its slowest pace in three years. While the expectation of slower growth this year is virtually universal, there is still a hot debate over whether the slowdown will worsen into a recession, ending the record six-year peacetime economic recovery. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> sent signals last week that it has begun lowering interest rates slightly. Optimists are hoping that move will occur in time to revive important sectors of the economy, such as housing and auto sales, that have been hurt by rising interest rates. The effect of the economic slowdown was evident in a companion report released today that showed the after-tax profits of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> corporations fell by 1.1 percent in the first three months of 1989. It was the first setback for corporate profits since a 2.5 percent decline in the first quarter of 1987. The primary reason for the slight upward revision in the overall 4.4 percent GNP figure was a better performance in trade than previously believed. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, as measured by the GNP, narrowed by $ 19.5 billion in the first quarter as exports shot up by 15 percent and imports fell by 0.5 percent. It was the first quarterly trade improvement since the spring of 1988. In other areas of the economy, consumer spending rose at a lackluster annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter, reflecting sluggish auto sales and weak demand in many other retail areas. Housing construction, which has been hard hit by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s anti-inflation campaign, dropped by 4.6 percent in the first quarter, the poorest performance in a year The various changes left the GNP, after adjusting for inflation, at an annual level of $ 4.077 trillion in the first quarter. The latest monthly survey of 51 top economists conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION> newsletter put the consensus growth forecast this year at 2.7 percent, down slightly from the previous month and significantly below the administration's projection of 3.2 percent. If the private economists are proven correct, that would spell bad news for the administration's hopes of meeting the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction target of $ 100 billion next year without a tax increase. Even with the effects of the drought last year, the GNP expanded at a four-year high of 3.9 percent. That rapid pace helped to drive unemployment down sharply. Many economists believe the unemployment rate will rise steadily this year and into 1990, hitting 5.7 percent a year from now. `` We are looking for the slowdown that started in the first quarter of the year to continue for the rest of 1989,'' said <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. In its own assessment of the economy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday said there were indications that growth was slowing and inflationary pressures were easing in response to the anti-inflation campaign launched by the central bank in March 1988. `` Economic growth for most of the nation continues to advance, but a number of <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> districts note ebbing rates of expansion,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said in a survey conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s 12 regional banks.

 A picket was shot and slightly wounded at a non-union coal mine today, and some of the 42,000 miners off the job in 10 states say they were theatened with violence if they returned to work under court order. Judges in at least four states have ordered the miners back to work. Today was the 10th day of wildcat walkouts in support of 1,900 miners on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> since April 5. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON>, 18, the son of a disabled miner, was grazed in the head as he picketed at <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a strike-closed mine in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON>, who is not a miner, was treated at a hospital and released. <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> was believed to be the first person wounded by gunfire since the unauthorized walkouts began. Previously, others had been hurt by rocks. State Police said no arrests were made. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately return calls. A <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday that he sees no quick end to the unauthorized walkouts, citing millions of dollars in fines that courts have levied against the union. `` Our members feel like they're fighting for our whole organization,'' said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> international executive board member from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` They feel the courts are being used as a means for destroying our organization.'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said miners have shown up for work but have encountered pickets and refused to cross the line. `` I've been warned by pickets, ` We'll find out where you live,''' miner <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanson </PERSON> said. `` The judge did n't understand this part _ the fear. Are those marshals going to be there when I get off work?'' <ORGANIZATION> Consolidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is seeking back-to-work orders in north-central <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and said it planned to take similar action in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. The company told a federal judge Wednesday that it was losing $ 500,000 a day at its north-central operations alone. <LOCATION> Tazewell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Circuit Judge N.E. Persin on Wednesday fined the union $ 300,000, saying it was responsible for picket line misconduct that resulted in coal trucks being hit by objects. One <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> company has asked the courts to order miners back to work, and two others have filed complaints with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. One company, <ORGANIZATION> Jim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said it is losing $ 600,000 a day. The union already has been assessed fines of $ 3 million in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, and a federal judge Wednesday fined six <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> union locals $ 2,500 each for defying a back-to-work order. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> police said shots were fired Wednesday afternoon at a security guard shack at the Logan-Mingo <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> office near <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION>. Guards were in the shack at the time but no one was injured and no arrests were made. In a separate strike, a <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, judge on Wednesday ordered county and state law enforcement officers to begin round-the-clock patrols at a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> operation near <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> to prevent violence About 130 miners who have been on strike there since January in a contract dispute have joined with <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> miners in several rallies. According to union and industry officials, the estimated number of miners involved in unauthorized walkouts Wednesday are: <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 16,000; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, 8,000; <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, 5,000; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, 2,660; <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 6,600; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> 1,750; <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, 1,500; <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, 755; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, 350; and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, 200.

 Rain in the western Corn Belt prompted early selling of corn and soybean futures today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> but wheat futures opened slightly higher on signs of Soviet buying interest. A slow-moving cold front triggered scattered showers that dropped amounts ranging from a trace to 1 -LCB- inches of rain Wednesday in western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. The storm system is expected to weaken as it makes its way east. Soybeans and soybean meal for near-term delivery opened slightly higher in line with stronger European demand for soybean meal. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s apparent interest in new purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat gave the wheat market a boost. `` They've got an official tender up right now for about 100,000 metric tons,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, a grain specialist with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 4.00 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 2.63 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with July at $ 1.59 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 6 -RCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with July at $ 7.39 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were moderately higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .03 cent to .23 cent higher with August at 70.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .65 cent higher with August at 81.40 cents a pound; live hogs were .08 cent to .38 cent higher with July at 49.30 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .63 cent to 1.18 cents higher with July at 34.20 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Union Announces Accord With Inland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> said it reached a tentative contract settlement early today with <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement would cover four years beginning Aug. 1, according to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON>, the union's chief negotiator with Inland. <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> said details would be withheld until the union can explain the contract to its 12,000 members at the nation's fourth-largest steel producer. The accord was announced as other union bargainers and officials at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> recoiled from the rank-and-file's surprise rejection of a tentative, 50-month contract agreement. <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members at <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> overwhelmingly accepted terms similar to the National settlement. National told its 7,000 employees in a letter sent Wednesday the offer is the best they can expect from a company that trails the major producers in profits per ton. Customers are already pulling orders, the company said. National's contract expires July 31, and no further bargaining sessions are scheduled. <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Steelworkers </LOCATION> negotiator <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who continues to recommend the offer, said strike plans are being prepared. `` The agreement you turned down would have increased your hourly compensation, counting inflation, by $ 6.57 per hour by 1993,'' National Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffee </PERSON> said in an open letter to <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members. `` It would have cost <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> $ 95.3 million more a year for represented employees alone by the end of the contract. That's $ 7.5 million more than we made in 1988, and 1988 was the most profitable year for <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> since 1979,'' he said. National rebutted complaints that <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members got more money in the early stages of their 50-month contract with <ORGANIZATION> Bethelehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` They gave up more in 1986, and they are catching up to you now,'' <PERSON> Coffee </PERSON> said. Like the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> agreement ratified recently by union members, the National offer would have restored past concessions and raised hourly wages by $ 1.50 over the contract term.

<HEAD>Pizza Chain Says No Drivers Under 18</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Domino's <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the subject of criticism for a series of fatal traffic accidents involving its delivery drivers, has told its stores to fire or reassign drivers who are under the age of 18, a spokesman said Thursday. Domino's spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said federal law prohibited the comapny from hiring drivers younger than 18, but in some cases people hired for other tasks have ended up delivering pizzas. Company-owned stores were being told that employees under 18 who drive should be fired or given other jobs, <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said. The move will affect about 300 employees at Domino's company-owned stores, about one-third of the Domino's 5,000 stores nationally, he said. The remaining two-thirds of the stores are franchises, which were being urged to make the same move, <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said. The company's directive led to confusion at a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Domino's store that gave pink slips to all its under-18 employees on Wednesday. Those under 18 who do n't drive were rehired later that day, the company stated. `` There was some miscommunication on our part,'' <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said. Domino's has acknowledged 20 fatal accidents in the last year involving its drivers, but denies the company's 29-year-old promise to deliver pizza within 30 minutes of a telephone order encourages employees' reckless driving. A 17-year-old Domino's driver, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Colson </PERSON>, was killed earlier this month when his small pickup truck skidded on a rain-slicked <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> road and hit a utility pole. His mother has claimed he was speeding and that Domino's guarantee was `` an invitation to break the law. Domino's has stated it knows of 20 fatalities involving Domino's drivers, pedestrians and others last year, but that accidents were bound to happen with such a large fleet, believed to be about 75,000 to 80,000 drivers <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said the directive on drivers under 18 was `` a reminder to follow the guidelines.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today defeated a White House-backed child-care plan offered by Republicans as an alternative to a broader program sponsored by the chamber's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan, defeated on a 56-44 vote, relied almost exclusively on tax credits, an approach Democrats said would not address the need for more child-care openings and improved quality of services. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then immediately took up the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership plan, which combines direct subsidies to help parents and states pay for child care with a tax-relief package similar to that proposed by the Republicans. The leadership plan was expected to win approval but, under an agreement between the parties, would still be subject to amendments. A final vote was not expected until Friday. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had refused to discuss a compromise on child care, forcing the partisan showdown. `` We've expressed an interest in talking to the White House all along,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> told reporters before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convened. `` The president and his aides have adamantly refused.'' Today's votes came a week after the start of debate dominated by floor speeches by co-authors of the revised Act for Better Child Care, Sens. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., and <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, defending it against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> attack The Dodd-Hatch bill would authorize $ 1.75 billion for fiscal 1990 to help parents and states pay for child care. Seventy percent of the money would help parents pay for child care, while the remaining 30 percent would be available to the states for programs designed to improve the availability and quality of care. The revised <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill, in the form of an amendment offered by <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, includes two tax changes. One would provide up to a $ 500 credit to low-income families to pay for children's health insurance. The other would make the existing dependent care tax credit refundable to low-income families, some of whom otherwise do not benefit from the provision because they have no federal tax liability to which to apply the credit. In promoting their alternative, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> senators have argued that the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> bill's subsidy provisions would result in state bureaucracies that would limit parental choice in child care, a position <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> have vigorously contested. `` We have a decidedly different approach to what is a real problem,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>. `` The word ` choice' is the critical distinction.'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., said the <LOCATION> Dodd-Hatch </LOCATION> plan would `` give to government the decision as to what kind of child care shall be provided. The GOP package would also make the dependent care credit refundable. Its other major provision would expand the existing Earned Income Tax Credit to provide addition tax relief to low-income families with children under age 5. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, calling that inadequate, said Wednesday the expanded credit would provide $ 750 to a poor family with two eligible children while child care for the two would cost about $ 6,000 a year. Also, he said, using the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> tax credits alone likely will not solve child-care problems because parents would not be required to spend the money on child care. Democrats have also attacked the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan for cutting off eligibility for the expanded credits at age 4, saying children twice that age and more need child care. The Dodd-Hatch bill allows payments for children up to age 13.

<TEXT>
 The takeover battle for British supermarket group <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> intensified Thursday as a sweetened offer from <ORGANIZATION> Isosceles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> was quickly countered by a competing bidder The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Wasserstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> raised their bid for Gateway to the equivalent of about $ 3.26 billion after Isosceles, a group of dissatisfied Gateway shareholders, increased their's to about $ 3.19 billion. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group is trying to rescue <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s third largest food retailer from its two-month old takeover fight against Isosceles. Gateway, which controls about 11 percent of the $ 54.6 billion <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> grocery market, has supported the Americans. <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> and A & amp; P, collectively bidding as Newgateway, have indicated that if their takeover succeeds they would keep much of Gateway intact, except for <PERSON> Herman </PERSON>'s sporting goods, which would be sold. Isosceles had planned a more radical reorganization and intended to sell off Gateway food stores. The latest <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON> <PERSON> Perella </PERSON> and A & amp; P bid is 235 pence -LRB- $ 3.66 dollars -RRB- a share, which values Gateway at 2.01 billion pounds -LRB- $ 3.26 billion -RRB-. The Isosceles offer was raised to 230 pence -LRB- $ 3.586 -RRB- a share from 210 pence -LRB- $ 3.274 -RRB- a share. Isosceles' total offer for Gateway's approximately 890 million shares would come to 2.05 billion pounds -LRB- $ 3.19 billion -RRB- Isosceles said <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to sell its 15.1 percent holding of Gateway shares at the new price. This raises Isosceles' stake in Gateway to 41.9 percent.

<HEAD>Bass Makes Offer to Integrated Resources, Source Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> has talked with <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> about investing in the financially troubled real estate and insurance concern in exchange for a controlling stake, a source said Thursday. Integrated is meeting with several interested parties, including <PERSON> Bass </PERSON>, about receiving a large capital infusion after the company last week announced plans to refinance $ 955 million in short-term debt, the source, who asked not be identified, said. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that a Bass-led group could be willing to pump as much as $ 200 million into Integrated conditional on Integrated stock and bond holders accepting a restructuring. Integrated had announced it would put up almost all of its $ 7.8 billion in assets and sharply cut back operations after defaulting on oustanding bonds and commercial paper because of a cash shortage. The Bass group would emerge with much of the equity while the company's common stock would be diluted, the Journal said. Bondholders would have the security of of a new investor. An Integrated spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Caouette </PERSON>, declined to comment on the newspaper report. After a delayed opening on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, Integrated was up 75 cents a share at $ 4.75 in mid-afternoon trading. The company's stock has plunged from $ 15 last week and $ 40 in 1986. Bass, whose widespread holdings include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> and various media, cable television and real estate properties, is believed to be interested in Integrated's network of financial consultants who sell a wide variety of investments ranging from insurance to real estate The New York-based concern has 35 subsidiaries and 750,000 investor accounts. The Journal said <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> believes he would be able to calm the concerns of <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>' bankers long enough to allow the company to develop its financial products. Bass does not think the company's real estate problems are so great, and he also believes the company's newer products like insurance and leveraged buyout fund investments are sound, the paper reported. Under its proposed restructuring, Integrated would replace $ 955 million in short-term debt with secured borrowings. The company also said it would cut back its operations substantially. The company, which has $ 1.1 billion in capital, also said it would concentrate on its core businesses of money management and mutual funds, variable insurance products and limited partnerships. Its debt to be restructured includes outstanding short-term bank debt, domestic and European commercial paper and notes outstanding under loan-sale programs. About 50 banks are providing short-term loans to Integrated and the company said it has about 50 to 75 holders of commercial paper and notes under loan-sale programs.

 <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it welcomes a planned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> joint venture to produce computer memory chips, a project that is aimed at competing with Japanese companies such as <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION>. `` We would welcome the comeback of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers to the DRAM business, since it would encourage vigorous competition in the worldwide semiconductor industry and this would lead to the healthy expansion of the industry,'' a company statement read.

<HEAD>Avon Permanently Stops Animal Testing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Thursday said it has permanently stopped using animals in its product safety tests, becoming the first major cosmetics maker to do so Animal rights activists praised <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> and said they hoped <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s decision would encourage other companies to completely halt animal testing The beauty products company said it will rely on alternative non-animal methods, harmless tests on people and an extensive computerized data base containing information on the safety of ingredients that previously have been examined. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said the company has been working since the early 1980s to reduce the number of animals used in evaluating its beauty products and to find other means. `` This marks the successful conclusion of that program,'' <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said. He had said months ago that the company intended to make the temporary ban permanent. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>, coordinator of a campaign to abolish animal testing organized by People for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, welcomed <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s decision. `` It's wonderful news. It's historic news,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> made a compassionate and progressive decision. We hope it encourages other companies to follow suit.'' <ORGANIZATION> PETA </ORGANIZATION>, which had made Avon the focus of an international campaign, said that it now will target <ORGANIZATION> Revlon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gillette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Cosmair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Before deciding to permanently stop animal testing, a practice <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> had temporarily discontinued earlier this year, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> had its new procedures reviewed by private scientists specializing in eye care, skin care and poisons <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was told of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s new procedures. The federal agency is responsible for monitoring the safety of cosmetics but its approval is not required for testing procedures. No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law specifically requires cosmetics to be tested on animals. <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> officials have said in the past that as a matter of practicality companies would n't use tests that government authorities considered inadequate. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said in a news release that until a broader range of non-animal tests are available, some suppliers to the cosmetics industry might have to continue to do some animal testing as formulas containing new raw ingredients are developed. Last year, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> approved 95 percent of its formulas through analysis using its data base, which is the foundation of its new evaluation procedures. Numerous companies in the cosmetics, chemical and pharmaceutical industries for years have been exploring ways that do n't involve animals to ensure that new products work as intended and that consumers are n't harmed by them. Avon is among many companies that donate money to fund research into possible replacements for traditional animal tests. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> said Thursday that the company will continue to fund research. Researchers around the country have been experimenting with cell cultures, bacteria, living tissue in test tubes and computer simulations, plus other potential testing methods. In February, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> announced it was no longer using the Draize eye irritation test, which has been widely used by industries for more than 50 years. The company replaced the Draize test, which uses rabbits, with a test-tube evaluation process developed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Avon, one of the largest manufacturers and marketers of cosmetics in the world, disbanded its own animal-testing operation last summer and has said it has n't asked independent laboratories to conduct tests on animals since mid-March of this year Other beauty products companies also have announced temporary suspensions or reductions in the use of animal tests.

 Former Wall Street trader <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> pleaded innocent Thursday to charges he assisted the securities fraud schemes of <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the jailed stock speculator he is accused of plotting to kill. <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Rumson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, was arraigned before a federal magistrate in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> on a 42-count indictment handed up last week. <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> was charged with manipulating the price of <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> common stock at <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s request and arranging a series of sham stock transactions to help <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> companies evade taxes and circumvent securities laws. Last month, <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> pleaded innocent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to state weapons possession charges in connection with an alleged plot on <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s life. <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> was arrested in February 1988 near his home with a loaded semiautomatic rifle that local authorities alleged he planned to use against <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. He previously had been charged in federal court with threatening a witness stemming from the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> case and was freed on $ 20 million bond. Federal officials have never identified the alleged target, but <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> police have said it was <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. Prosecutors said the federal charge of threatening a witness would be dropped in favor of the state weapons possession charges. At a bail hearing on the securities case, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Miriam </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> <PERSON> Cedarbaum </PERSON> denied defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON>'s request to reduce his bond <PERSON> Puccio </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> poses no danger to the community and that the bond was unreasonably high. But because the defense had not shown the bond caused <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> hardship, <PERSON> Cedarbaum </PERSON> said: `` I am not persuaded that I should reduce the bail that is in place today.'' <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> was charged with conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud and keeping fraudulent records. If convicted, he faces a maximum five years in prison and $ 250,000 in fines on each count. <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> was a general partner and chief trader at <ORGANIZATION> Jamie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, a now-defunct <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> investment and arbitrage firm. Also arraigned with <PERSON> Mulheren </PERSON> Thursday was <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON>, 32, a former trader at <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON>. He was named on three counts of conspiracy, mail fraud and fraudulent record keeping. <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON> also pleaded innocent and was released on $ 125,000 bond. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, whose guilty plea led to a series of Wall Street investigations, is serving a three-year sentence at a minimum security prison in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He also paid $ 100 million in fines and restitution to settle civil insider trading charges in late 1986.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> came in for renewed criticism at world trade talks Thursday for threatening unilateral action against countries accused of blocking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports. At a closed meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was also criticized for refusing to accept a ruling against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patent law, but won praise for agreeing to ease restrictions on imports of sugar, a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. At the meeting the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> both accepted <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> rulings that they should allow freer access to imports of fruit, the official said. The <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> council meeting also received a formal bid for membership from <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, the only sizable Latin American country not in the 96-nation trade group, and heard an announcement by <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> that it would slash import taxes on nearly 2,000 products, the official said. Brazilian ambassador <PERSON> Rubens </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricupero </PERSON> told the closed session that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> threat to impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on some <LOCATION> Brazilian </LOCATION> goods `` places under threat the entire Brazilian export sector,'' according to a text of his speech released to journalists. Indian delegate <PERSON> Bal </PERSON> <PERSON> Krishan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zutshi </PERSON> said it would be `` extremely difficult'' to yield to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for direct talks about the trade barriers under `` threat of unilateral retaliation.'' A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> deputy trade representative, <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Yerxa </PERSON>, told the meeting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action was justified and added the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was prepared to pursue its grievances within the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> multilateral system of rules, according to the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> official who was present at the meeting. Under a controversial section of its 1988 trade act, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last month announced priority action against <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for import quotas, against <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for restrictions on foreign investment and against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for refusing to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> superconductors and satellites. It has said the three countries must agree to negotiations and remove the offending barriers within 18 months or face retaliatory tariffs. More than 20 countries have criticized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy at <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> meetings Wednesday and Thursday, the official said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was also criticized by several negotiators for refusing to accept a <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> dispute panel ruling against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patent law, the official said. In a case raised by the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, the panel found that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dealt more harshly with foreign products challenged with infringing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> patents than with home-produced goods similarly challenged. <PERSON> Yerxa </PERSON> said he saw `` no existing means of reconciling the adoption of the report with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political and commercial interests,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> official. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has now blocked adoption of the report at five council meetings. However, <PERSON> Yerxa </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> accepted the findings of a report that its quota on sugar imports violated free trade rules and said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would be considering how to ease the restrictions. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> for its part said it accepted a dispute panel ruling that it must reform its controls on imports of dessert apples following complaints from both the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> agreed to adopt a judgment that it should not restrict imports of apples and pears into the country, the official said. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s application to join the <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is significant because it also belongs to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel, which has the opposite aims of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> in that it seeks to control oil trade and prices. There are now 10 countries, including <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, waiting to join <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $4.01 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual funds rose $ 4.01 billion in the latest week to a new all-time high of $ 321.26 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. It was the eighth straight weekly increase and the eighth-straight record amount in fund assets, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group reported. The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a $ 2.79 billion increase in fund assets the previous week, revised down slightly from the $ 2.80 billion rise originally reported. `` Assets in all fund categories continued to surge even though short-term interest rates kept easing,'' said <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>, institute vice president and chief economist. `` Past experience suggests, however, that the upward trend in money market fund assets is likely to coninue past the short-term interest rates peak and well into their decline,'' <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> said. The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $ 780.8 million to $ 102.92 billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $ 1.45 billion to $ 135.64 billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds rose $ 1.79 billion to $ 82.70 billion. In another report, the seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in the week ended Tuesday to 8.89 percent from 8.94 percent the previous week, according to <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s Money Fund Report, a trade journal based in <LOCATION> Holliston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. The 30-day average yield fell to 9.01 percent from 9.08 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 39 days, unchanged from the previous week, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.56 percent as of Wednesday from 6.57 percent a week earlier. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, was 5.14 percent, unchanged from the previous week. Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.88 percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.93 the previous week. Yields were 8.94 percent on 1-year CDs, down from 9.00 percent; 8.77 percent on 2 -LCB- - year CDs, down from 8.82 percent; and 8.70 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.78 percent

<TEXT>
 The 54-story former <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> _ one of the largest in the city and 91 percent occupied _ is on the sale block for $ 300 million, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> BetaWest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the real estate arm of <ORGANIZATION> U </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has hired the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking firm of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to sell the six-year-old building. The building was renamed 1801 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> when <ORGANIZATION> Mountain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> changed its name to U S West last year. The Rocky Mountain News reported Thursday that real estate officials said <PERSON> BetaWest </PERSON>'s asking price, at about $ 250 per square foot, is too high, and they believe the building likely would sell for $ 250 million to $ 270 million. BetaWest bought the building in September 1987 from <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 196 million in the largest-ever single-property transaction in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region. About 60 percent of the building's occupied space now is leased by U S West. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Ardenne </PERSON>, senior vice president for <ORGANIZATION> Equitable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year offered the building to his firm, but the price was too high. He said it is not unusual for a building the size of 1801 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to be sold through a Wall Street firm. `` With a deal that size, you have to have access to capital markets, and those guys have access,'' <PERSON> D'Ardenne </PERSON> said.

 The stock market pulled out of a three-session slide Thursday, encouraged by lower interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 21.47 points in the week's first three sessions, recovered 17.26 to 2,482.17. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 813 up, 626 down and 528 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 176.51 million shares, up from 168.83 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 207 million shares. Analysts said traders were encouraged to see interest rates decline slightly in the government securities market in spite of a mixed dollar in foreign exchange. But many Wall Streeters were still treading cautiously as they awaited indications of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s next move in its credit policy. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> revised its figure for growth of the gross national product in the first quarter to an annual rate of 4.4 percent, after adjustment for inflation. Previously the department had estimated it at 4.3 percent. Analysts said such a small adjustment did n't do much to stir the market out of its recent lethargy. On the market agenda for Friday are monthly reports on new orders for durable goods and personal income and spending for May. <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> climbed 5 \ to 40 -LRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> gained ~ to 16 <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> made a bid to take over <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION>, which owns 49 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION>.

Stride Rite gained ~ to 54 -RRB-, hitting new 52-week highs. Buying in the stock was ascribed both to takeover speculation and expectations of a strong quarterly earnings showing by the company. <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> dropped -LCB- to 12 -LRB- in the over-the-counter market. The company said it expects to post a loss for the second quarter and the first half of the year.

<HEAD>Hanson Trust Bids $4.8 Billion For Consolidated Gold Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Hanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 4.8 billion buyout offer Thursday for <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, going after the mining giant that two months ago escaped a hostile takeover attempt by another suitor. Gold Fields quickly advised shareholders not to accept the bid but indicated it was willing to talk with <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, which owns businesses operations ranging from brewing to brickmaking in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> offered 14.30 pounds a share, about $ 22.29 at current exchange rates, for Gold Fields, one of the world's biggest gold mining companies and owner of a 49.3 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gold miner. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> also said it had agreed to acquire the 29.9 percent stake in Gold Fields held by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, the investment group that failed in a $ 5.46 billion hostile takeover attempt of the company. Gold Fields shares jumped 1.70 pounds, about $ 2.63, to 14.23 pounds a share, about $ 22.05, on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following news of the offer. Lord <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, chairman of the conglomerate, called the offer a `` full and fair price.'' But <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of Gold Fields, advised his stockholders not to sell yet, saying the offer undervalued the company's assets. However, <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON> also said he would meet with <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> `` to impress upon him the true worth of Gold Fields,'' an indication he might seek a sweetened bid. Gold Fields shares had fallen after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> court in April refused to lift an injunction blocking on antitrust grounds the takeover attempt by <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, which is controlled by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s powerful Oppenheimer mining family. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> had argued it would sell Gold Fields' stakes in <ORGANIZATION> Newmont </ORGANIZATION> and a number of other major mining operations if its takeover succeeded, but the court sided with government concerns that the acquisition of Gold Fields sizable holdings could lessen competition in gold and strategic metals markets. <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> had received acceptances of its offer from about 25 percent of Gold Fields' shareholders which, combined with the 29.9 percent it already owned, would have given <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> control of Gold Fields. `` Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> is a serious company and any approach from it has to be carefully considered,'' said <PERSON> Agnew </PERSON>. `` However, <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s opening offer completely fails to reflect the value of Gold Fields. It would benefit <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s shareholders but it does not sufficiently benefit ours.'' <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwardes </PERSON> said his company viewed the sale of its Gold Fields shares to <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> as `` a very satisfactory outcome.'' <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> would receive 915.2 million pounds, $ 1.43 billion, from the sale of its 64 million shares. <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> is involved in tobacco, bricks, electricals, cement, tools and other basic industries and made pretax profits last year of $ 1.37 billion. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> its subsidiaries include <ORGANIZATION> Kidde </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the diversified manufacturer; <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the typewriter maker; <ORGANIZATION> Durkee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hygrade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> SCM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Gold Fields, besides its mining interests, manufactures a range of products that analysts say complement many <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON> business lines, with little overlap <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Haville </PERSON>, an analyst at brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s bid for Gold Fields was `` a reasonably pitched, intelligent offer.'' Gold Fields shareholders would find <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s cash offer far more appealing than the cash-and-share proposal <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> made. `` Institutions will consider it very attractive indeed,'' said <PERSON> Haville </PERSON>.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> partners of the accounting giants <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> have voted overwhelmingly in favor of a previously-announced proposal to merge the firms, it was announced Thursday. The merger plan, which will be submitted to partnerships abroad over the next few months, would create the world's largest professional services firm, to be known as <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. The new firm, which will be based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, is expected to begin merged operations by Oct. 1. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said partners in each firm voted separately on the merger and that about 99 percent favored the combination. Top executives of the companies said in proposing the merger May 19 that it would enhance each firms' professional capabilities and provide better service to clients. It will provide accounting and auditing, tax, management and informations systems consulting. <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Whinney </LOCATION>, based in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, is the fourth-largest accounting and consulting firm in the world while New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> ranks fifth in terms of revenue, the firms said. The new firm would have revenue of $ 4.3 billion, putting it ahead of the current world leader, <ORGANIZATION> KPMG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marwick </ORGANIZATION>, with revenue of $ 3.9 billion. The combined <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firm would be the largest single firm within the new multinational operation. It would account for 25,000 of the new concern's 70,000 employees, 2,105 of its 6,100 worldwide partners and $ 2 billion of its $ 4.3 billion in worldwide revenue. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON> will be led by co-chief executives, <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gladstone </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Whinney </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Groves </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Dollar Hit by Rumor and Lack of Buying Interest; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precede LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar sank against major foreign currencies Thursday in a slide deepened by a rumor, quickly denied by the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had been shot. The dollar managed to recover some lost ground after the White House denial. Currency dealers said the rumor circulated in foreign exchange markets for 45 minutes to an hour. But a lack of buying interest in the dollar plus dollar sales by central banks to prop up the sagging British pound contributed to a generally weak day for the dollar, dealers said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikus </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> rumor `` probably pushed the dollar through 140 yen, triggering a lot of stop-loss sales,'' which were aimed at limiting losses by unloading dollars in case the currency declined further. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON>, a senior trader at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office, said trading was thin and choppy with the market on guard for possible central bank intervention. A report by a Washington-based consulting group that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were determined to bring the dollar lower by selling the American currency has been denied by central banks but has left traders extra wary, <PERSON> Morrissey </PERSON> said. The British pound was hammered during the day by reports of more railway strikes following Wednesday's 24-hour shutdown of the national rail network over a pay claim. The pound recovered a bit in European trading when the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s central bank, intervened in the market by buying pounds to hold up the exchange rate. Late Thursday in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.5525, more expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $ 1.54675. Sterling was weighed down by renewed selling later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, possibly acting on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, was believed to have sold dollars and bought pounds, currency dealers said. A pound was quoted at $ 1.5585 late in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared to $ 1.5553 Wednesday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell to 141.40 Japanese yen from 144.95 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Thursday the dollar was trading higher at 140.90 yen, but it slid to 139.30 yen later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, down from 142.55. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with Wednesday's rates, included: 1.9515 West German marks, down from 1.9610; 1.6820 Swiss francs, down from 1.6905; 1.19135 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19325; 6.6215 French francs, down from 6.6565; and 1,417.75 Italian lire, down from 1,423.50 Late rates for the dollar in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with levels late Wednesday were: 1.9590 West German marks, down from 1.9680; 1.6860 Swiss francs, down from 1.7005; 6.6325 French francs, down from 6.6795; 2.2005 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2375; 1,418.50 Italian lire, down from 1.439.50; and, 1.1925 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19675. Gold prices pulled back slightly in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after rising on markets abroad. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a bid of $ 370.25 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m. EDT, down $ 1 from Wednesday's late bid. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 371 a troy ounce, down $ 1.40 from Wednesday's settlement price Gold bullion closed at a bid of $ 369.75 a troy ounce in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> market, up from $ 366.75 late Wednesday. The closing price in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was $ 370.60 bid, up from $ 366.40. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid of $ 370.35, up from $ 365.95. Silver bullion prices rose. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $ 5.292 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's $ 5.285. Silver bullion traded late in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid of $ 5.34 a troy ounce, up from $ 5.28.

<HEAD>Signs Of Soviet Buying Send Sugar Futures To 11-Month High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Reports of sugar purchases by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> whipped the sugar futures market into a bullish frenzy Thursday, with prices reaching an 11-month high on speculation that the surprise transactions implied further buying down the road. On other markets, corn and soybean futures wilted as rain arrived in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>; coffee futures rallied; and energy, precious-metals and livestock and meat futures were mixed. Sugar futures settled .50 cent to .94 cent higher on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in July at $ 1.399 a pound, the market's highest level since July 25 The rally was fueled by trade reports that the Soviets had bought 2 cargoes of refined white sugar and one cargo of raw sugar on the open market. One cargo equals 10,000 to 12,000 metric tons. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> usually does its sugar buying in the fall and winter, and had stated repeatedly earlier this year that it completed its sugar buying for all of 1989. `` A lot of people in the business view this as the tip of the proverbial iceberg, meaning the Soviets will come in and do even more shopping,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst who follows the sugar, coffee and cocoa markets for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts predicted new Soviet purchases would total at least 100,000 metric tons and could run as high as 300,000 metric tons Some speculated the Soviets were forced to enter the world market because of slow shipments from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> or because the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> sugar-beet crop was smaller than expected. Or they may simply have observed the market's sharp upward move over the past several weeks and decided to lay in supplies before prices go higher. `` They look at supply-and-demand figures as much as everyone else,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenhop </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Corn and soybean futures fell sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as showers drenched some of the driest croplands in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Rainfall amounts varied widely in the western Corn Belt, but one report of a four-inch dousing in western <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> apparently convinced traders that the severely dry conditions there were finally easing. Wheat settled -LCB- cent to 3 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 3.98 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 4 -LCB- cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.62 \ a bushel; oats were 5 cents to 6 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 1.57 a bushel; soybeans were 14 cents to 22 \ cents lower with July at $ 7.23 -LCB- a Coffee futures rallied strongly on the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on buying supported by indications of tight near-term supplies and by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement of a 1.5-million-bag cut in export quotas of high-quality mild arabica coffees. A bag of coffee equals 60 kilograms or about 132 pounds. The export cut was triggered by a drop in coffee prices. Coffee settled 1 cent to 2.72 cents higher with July at $ 1.1899 a pound. Unleaded gasoline futures climbed sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that refuted Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report showing a substantial rise in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of gasoline. The rally spilled over to the crude-oil and heating-oil markets. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent lower to 10 cents higher with August at $ 19.30 a barrel; heating oil was .64 cent to 1.02 cents higher with July at 48.62 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .56 cent to 1.89 cents higher with July at 60.99 cents a gallon. Gold futures set back a bit on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following the strong gains of the previous session. Silver inched up. Gold settled $ 1.40 to $ 1.60 higher with August at $ 374.20 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 0.7 cent higher with July at $ 5.303 a troy ounce. Livestock and meat futures finished little changed in listless trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .33 cent lower with August at 69.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .50 cent higher with August at 81.30 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent lower to .13 cent higher with July at 49.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .05 cent lower to .17 cent higher with July at 33.67 cents a pound.

 A representative of the major oil companies on Thursday attacked President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s clean-air proposal involving methanol-powered cars, saying it could add to public health risks without significantly improving air quality. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel the oil industry was unhappy with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for requiring the use of cars powered by methanol to reduce certain smog-causing pollutants. `` Methanol fuel use is unlikely to result in significant air quality improvements, raises serious public health concerns because of methanol's high toxicity, and will not enhance national energy security significantly,'' <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON> said. The oil industry produces about 110 billion gallons of gasoline a year. It currently does not have the capacity to produce large quantities of alternative fuels. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his proposals, announced June 12 as part of a broad package of measures aimed at making the air cleaner, would combat smog in urban areas by reducing emissions of carbon monoxide, while also limiting toxic pollutants such as benzene. It would require that 500,000 alternative-fuel cars be built by 1995. <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON> told a subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking, <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that consumers will pay more per mile for methanol than gasoline, will need to fill up more frequently because methanol burns less efficiently, and may have more problems starting their cars in cold weather because methanol needs more heat to start burning. `` Under a methanol mandate, consumers would have to bear these costs and yet not receive a significant overall improvement in air quality,'' <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON> said. <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON> also said limited domestic supplies of natural gas _ the cheapest source for methanol _ meant <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal could undermine national security. This is because the extra supplies of natural gas would come, at least in part, from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, thus adding to American dependence on an unstable region, he said. <PERSON> DiBona </PERSON> also criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals for reducing gasoline's volatility, or its ability to evaporate into the atmosphere, and for requiring gasoline pump controls aimed at reducing the amount of vapors escaping into the air

 Energy futures prices finished mostly higher Thursday, led by gasoline futures after a government report showed a drop in gasoline supplies, contradicting an earlier industry figure. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the August contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, slipped a penny to close at $ 19.30 a barrel, after gaining 43 cents on Wednesday. Other crude contracts closed narrowly higher. Among refined products, the July contract for unleaded gasoline rose 1.89 cents to close at 60.99 cents a gallon, after a 0.7 cent decline on Wednesday. August unleaded gasoline gained 1.61 cents to 58.30 cents a gallon and September closed at 55.79 cents, up 1.43 cents. Heating oil also advanced, with the July contract settling 0.64 cent higher at 48.62 cents a gallon. Contracts for delivery later in the year posted higher gains. Traders said crude prices started out strong amid news of an oil production slowdown in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> due to pipeline problems. But the market's attention turned to gasoline futures after a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> report showed that gasoline inventories declined last week. The report contradicted an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report released on Tuesday showing a rise in gasoline inventories. Gasoline futures prices dipped on Wednesday after the API, which represents major oil producers and refiners, reported that gasoline stocks rose by 1.6 million barrels to 221.1 million barrels last week despite an increase in demand as the summer driving season picks up. But the DOE report released late Wednesday showed that total gasoline supplies were down 1.3 million barrels to 218.7 million barrels. `` The new numbers were surprising because usually the two reports are pretty close,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was a factor that affected prices.'' Both reports showed a decline in crude and heating oil inventories for the week and a drop of some 30 million barrels in total oil supplies, including crude and products, from last year.

<TEXT>
 The New Directions dissident movement in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, stung by defeats here, will expand its scope and hold a convention this fall, the group's leader said Thursday. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who on Wednesday lost a re-election bid to the union's 21-member International Executive Board, said a steering committee would be formed to guide the movement's efforts. He also said a convention would be held this fall at a time and place yet to be set and that a limited organizing effort, calling for $ 30-a-year membership fee, would be expanded nationwide. However, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said the New Directions had no immediate plans to form a formal dissident group within the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> did within the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> in 1976. The <ORGANIZATION> TDU </ORGANIZATION> and New Directions share some goals, such as increasing individual member participation in union affairs, and have the same attorney, <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Yablonski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It's an accelerating and a broadening of what's been going on,'' <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said after the New Directions forces held a caucus at a hotel near the convention. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> in an election for director of Region 5, said Wednesday that his election was the `` beginning of the end for New Directions.'' But, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> countered Thursday, `` I think <PERSON> Brother </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyse </PERSON> will soon find that New Directions is accelerating ...'' New Directions has suffered a defeat on the convention floor every day since the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s triennial constitutional convention opened Sunday. It made challenges to delegation members being seated, then a resolution calling for direct election of top national officers and a move to restrict joint labor-management programs on plant floors. All those efforts failed. But <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> and his backers remained optimistic about the future of their organization and its effect on <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> administration. `` They know they have to deal with us for the next three years,'' said New Directions member <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tweed </PERSON> of Local 596 in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` We know they will go in -LRB- to factories -RRB- and pay more attention in each local. If they do that we have to get the credit for it.''

<HEAD>Pickers Turn Backs on Strawberries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION>'s strawberry harvest is in slow motion as pickers leave the fields for the more lucrative cherry crop east of the <LOCATION> Cascade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION>. `` We could use 1,500 people, but the berries are turning soft, and it's getting late,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON>, agricultural field representative for the state Employment Division in <LOCATION> Hillsboro </LOCATION>. `` The crop is only half of usual, and we do n't even have enough pickers for that,'' <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said Wednesday of the situation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Growers had worried earlier that too few pickers would arrive from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and elsewhere this year because of confusion over the new immigration law. Plenty of pickers showed up, but many are leaving mid-harvest. In East Multnomah County, grower <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sester </PERSON> waited anxiously for labor for a third picking of his 30 acres of berries. `` The first two pickings pay our expenses. It's the third picking that puts us into the profit side,'' <PERSON> Sester </PERSON> said. `` We've been in pretty good shape up to this point. We have about 70 percent of our crop picked,'' he said. At the nearby <ORGANIZATION> Scenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> packing plant in <LOCATION> Gresham </LOCATION>, owner <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredenkamp </PERSON> watched his new quick-freeze line idled for lack of berries. The plant usually employs 350 people on two shifts during the seasonal peak, but only one shift was working four or five hours. <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON>, administrative assistant at <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cherry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growers </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dalles </ORGANIZATION>, said he was not surprised by the exodus of pickers from berry fields to the cherry orchards. `` We have a big, beautiful crop to pick for two or three weeks, and the growers up in the <LOCATION> Yakima </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> do, too. I think we're doing OK on supply of pickers,'' <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> said. Besides the lure of higher earnings for workers, `` we have some awfully nice housing. We've spent money on it for 20 years,'' he said. The 7,000 acres of orchards in <LOCATION> Wasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> have some of the largest concentrations of cherry farms in the world, <PERSON> McAllister </PERSON> pointed out. <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> said workers found the first picking of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> strawberries worthwhile earlier this month. But the unusual winter kill of plants resulted in poor yields in many of the second and third pickings, discouraging pickers, she explained. Some of the foreign workers who qualified for work permits under immigration law reform have abandoned all types of farms, leaving a smaller labor pool, she added. `` People who got work permits want to get into factories or something else with benefits and stability. You ca n't blame them,'' she said. Immigration law allows farmers to recruit foreigners without work permits, but there are many restrictions and a 60-day lead time.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union said it reached a tentative four-year contract settlement Thursday with <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that raises wages in each of the first three years, improves pensions and avoids any worker concessions. `` We're going to recommend it, and it does meet all the goals our members helped formulate. I think they'll accept it,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 31 and chief negotiator with the nation's fourth-largest steel producer. Inland originally wanted concessions, including the right to schedule workers for a 12-hour work day, <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> said. The company also wanted the employees to help pay medical insurance premiums. Both demands were withdrawn by company negotiators. Incentive pay will be increased in the fourth year, and the agreement also improves pension benefits and resolves differences over the status of maintenance jobs, he said. Inland's workers gave no wage concessions in the 1986 negotiations, so there was no restoration of past sacrifices. The talks began March 7, earliest among four major producers who shared July 31 contract expirations. By a self-imposed settlement deadline of March 31, Inland still was demanding concessions and had offered no wage increase, <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> said. `` We had n't had a raise in about eight years, when inflation was 22 percent. The company made a big buck. Management got raises. They deserve raises, but so do we,'' <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> said. By late May `` we still could n't convince our counterparts that our members were entitled to share in those profits,'' he said. `` We started preparing for a strike.'' The 12,000 <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members at Inland were hearing late in the bargaining that a sticking point remained over wage increases in the first year, and their fellow union members at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> this week surprised negotiators by rejecting a 50-month offer in part because it offered less money up front than workers accepted from <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The Inland settlement came around 4 a.m. in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, where the company is based.

<HEAD>Eastern Pilot Flew with Broken Foot, Paper Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal investigators are looking into a charge that an <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot with a broken foot and two newly hired co-pilots flew into a difficult South American airport, a newspaper reported Thursday. Eastern union sources said the captain, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Neville </PERSON>, suffered a broken foot in a car accident June 15 on his way to the airport in <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paraguay </LOCATION>. Despite the injury, <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> continued flying even though a broken foot could make him unqualified for duty, the sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, for an article published Thursday. One stop on the flight was in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, an airport <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s operations manual designates as one at which only the captain can make takeoffs and landings. The airport is in the mountains, and nearby terrain rises 8,000 feet above the airport. Flying an airliner with such an injury is dangerous because foot pedals help steer the plane and heavy pressure is required in some wind conditions or if an engine fails, the union sources said. Eastern officials said the claim was an effort by its striking unions to hurt the airline by raising doubts about its safety. `` This type of manufactured, alleged incident is typical of the safety-related scare tactics that -LRB- the pilots union -RRB- is using at this point,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> did n't feel he had been incapacitated after the auto accident. After returning to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, the captain was checked out by <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s medical department and his private physician and was cleared to continue flying with a hairline fracture in his foot, <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. `` This is not the type of thing you would even put a cast on,'' <PERSON> Matell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Neville </PERSON>, a resident of <PERSON> Davie </PERSON>, near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for comment. `` The -LRB- pilots union -RRB- called it to our attention last weekend, and we're looking into it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The medical report is being sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> but has not yet arrived, <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said. Besides the captain, the cockpit crew reportedly included two recent graduates of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s pilot training program. Pilots union spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> called <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> `` the most dangerous'' airport in Eastern's system because of the mountains. He also said Eastern has scaled back training aimed at helping new pilots handle <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flights because of its need to train them quickly. Eastern suffered a fatal crash into a <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> mountainside five years ago. The union has charged that the company, moving ahead with a rebuilding plan relying mainly on newly hired pilots, is risking safety by using so many inexperienced pilots.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply rose in mid-June but a narrower money measure fell, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 rose $ 4.8 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,084.8 billion in the week ended June 12 from $ 3,080.0 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, rose $ 7.5 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,970.8 billion from $ 3,963.3 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, slipped $ 6.6 billion to a seasonally adjusted $ 769.5 billion from $ 776.1 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,078.0 billion, a 1.2 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,957.0 billion, up 3.4 percent, while M1 fell 4.5 percent to an average of $ 778.8 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 546 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from $ 471 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 289.9 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, up from $ 289.2 billion two weeks earlier

<HEAD>World Coffee Export Quota Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday slashed the quota for exports after a sharp fall in world prices. The association of producers and consumers, which regulates the $ 10 billion annual world trade in coffee beans, cut 1.53 million bags, reducing the global allocation for the current year to 55.34 million bags. `` No further cut is possible,'' a statement said. One bag contains 60 kilos or 132 pounds. Most of the reduction will be borne by <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and the other producers of the prized arabica type of bean, most of them Latin American. The cut became inevitable when the price of coffee fell below the organization's $ 1.30-a-pound indicator price for arabica coffee. The organization of 74 countries tries to keep the average price of the two basic coffee types, arabica and robusta, within a band of $ 1.10 to $ 1.40 a pound by balancing supply with demand through quota adjustments at fixed prices. Despite previous quota reductions that affected only robusta producers, the average price of both types last week dropped below $ 1.10 a pound. Robusta coffee is the poorer and less popular type produced throughout most of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Pizza Chain Says No Drivers Under 18</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Domino's <ORGANIZATION> Pizza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, under fire for a series of fatal traffic accidents involving delivery people, plans to stop hiring employees under 18 although current workers can stay, a spokesman said Thursday. The decision came after <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> parents complained about layoffs following an earlier directive to re-assign or fire drivers under 18. But Domino's will recommend that its stores not hire people under 18 for driving or non-driving jobs in the future, spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said. The earlier move led to confusion when at least one Domino's outlet in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> gave pink slips to all employees under 18 on Wednesday Domino's <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> division gave instructions to discharge all workers under 18, but modified them later Wednesday after parents complained to the company's regional office in <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said. `` Some of our people jumped the gun,'' he said. `` There was some miscommunication on our part.'' <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said it was Domino's policy to comply with federal law prohibiting the hiring of drivers younger than 18. In some cases, however, people hired for other tasks have ended up delivering pizzas, he said. Domino's has acknowledged 20 fatalities in the last year in accidents involving its drivers, but denies the company's 29-year-old promise to deliver pizza within 30 minutes of a telephone order encourages employees' reckless driving Federal child labor laws forbid hiring people under 18 for several hazardous occupations, including drivers. The law does n't rule out occasional driving for younger workers, however Domino's re-examined its hiring practices after June 3, when deliveryman <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Colson </PERSON>, 17, died in a one-vehicle accident in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. His mother has claimed he was speeding and that Domino's guarantee was `` an invitation to break the law. But <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said the hiring directive was `` a reminder to follow the guidelines. We decided to have everybody review their employees on individual basis.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> examined the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> accident and would have directed regional officials to talk to Domino's if a wider problem was suspected, said a department spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> D.C </ORGANIZATION>. The department's assistant district director for <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Valeria </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobecki </PERSON>, said she had n't been told to take up the question with Domino's. <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said <PERSON> Domino </PERSON>'s has talked with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about driver age requirements before. `` We had all our paperwork in order,'' he said. The review will affect about 300 employees at company-owned Domino's stores who are under 18, he said. Company-owned stores comprise about one-third of Domino's 5,000 stores nationwide. The remaining two-thirds of the stores are franchises. <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said franchise owners were being urged to make the same move. `` It is highly recommended to the franchises, but it is n't contractually binding,'' he said Domino's company-owned stores and franchises combined have about 150,000 employees, including 70,000 to 80,000 delivery drivers, <PERSON> Hingst </PERSON> said.

 Canadian real estate giant <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Thursday it has made a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, after the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> reported the company was among four finalists vying for the world's tallest building. Three other parties named by the newspaper as finalists for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s 110-story building said they could not comment on the report. The bids are said to range from $ 800 million to $ 1 billion, which would be the highest price paid for an American building, the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> said, citing `` individuals familiar with the process.'' However, the bids are probably below <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' expectations, a source told the newspaper. `` We have submitted a bid,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenthal </PERSON>, a spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for Toronto-based <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York, the largest private commercial real estate developer in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He would not disclose the size of the bid and declined further comment. The three other bidders named by the Journal are <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> pension manager <ORGANIZATION> JMB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> with developer <ORGANIZATION> Trammell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> developer <ORGANIZATION> LaSalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> pension adviser <PERSON> Aldrich </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Waltch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> LaSalle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Needham </PERSON> said her firm `` looks at every significant real estate opportunity in the country'' but would not confirm a bid for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> All the other companies named in the Journal story referred telephone calls to senior executives or corporate spokespersons, all of whom were said to be unavailable and did not return calls. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Fairweather </PERSON> said the Journal did not get its information from <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're not commenting on the process of the sale. It's been going on for a while and we expect it will go on for a while,'' he said. `` When we have a deal we'll announce it.'' Even the lowest of the reported bids would top the highest price ever paid for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> building, $ 660 million paid by <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorenstein </PERSON> in 1985 for the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. But all the reported bids are below the $ 1.2 billion to $ 2 billion that real-estate experts expected the building would fetch when <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> announced last October it would sell the downtown <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> landmark as part of a corporate restructuring. The Japanese government has discouraged Japanese bids on <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, fearing an anti-Japan backlash if they were to be successful in acquiring such a prominent piece of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Oharenko </PERSON>, a managing partner in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wakefield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate firm that has represented Japanese buyers in other property deals. The Sears Tower sale has been overshadowed lately by the company's plan to move its 6,000-employee merchandise group out of the tower to a location that the company expects to announce within a week. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> hopes to retain the retail arm of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, but several states, including <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, also are in the running. The merchandise group occupies most of the 50 lower floors of the tower. The problem of finding tenants for those floors, which are considered less desirable than the upper levels, is one of the factors holding down the price tag for the building, <PERSON> Oharenko </PERSON> said.
