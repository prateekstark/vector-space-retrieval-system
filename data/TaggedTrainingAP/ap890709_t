 Fires tore through brush and trees across the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Sunday, with one threatening an old cavalry fort where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed, but lower temperatures and higher humidity were helping firefighters. Fires burned out of control in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. A fire in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> was contained. Light rain and lower temperatures all but extinguished three large wildfires in interior <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, including one that charred 24,000 acres. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> said about 31,000 fires had been reported through Sunday, and about 1.5 million acres have burned this year, according to information officer <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. By the same time last year, 55,000 fires had been reported and 765,000 acres blackened. The center was coordinating the efforts of 10,000 firefighters, he said. It also had 50 air tankers in use, up from 42 on Saturday. `` We're having some storm activity bringing some relief in the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, but when it moves east, it's creating more fires due to lightning in eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The biggest fire in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was the <ORGANIZATION> Diamond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> fire, at 12,500 acres, in eastern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, but it was 80 percent contained by Sunday morning, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Plumb </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Moab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION>. Efforts were focused on keeping it out of a 50,000-acre state roadless area, similar to a federal wilderness zone, she said. `` It's real wild, rugged country, real heavy timber,'' Plumb said. `` We dont want it to get in there.'' Several other fires in the state were nearing containment by fire lines, officials said. A lightning-sparked fire burned along a 20-mile front in northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, threatening the community of <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and forcing the evacuation of more than 629 people from a hospital, nursing home and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> issued an emergency declaration, making state money available, and ordered <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> troops to help fight the fire. The blaze was within a half-mile of the old <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION>, where Crazy Horse was killed by guards in 1877, and fire burned to within 1 -LCB- miles of <LOCATION> Crawford </LOCATION>, a city of 1,300, authorities said. The 6-mile-wide blaze scorched 50,000 to 100,000 acres, said deputy state fire marshal <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. `` We could see whole lines of trees exploding,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, a state game and parks commissioner who flew over the fire. A mushroom cloud of smoke was visible about 90 miles away. The fire burned 10,000 to 12,000 acres of trees, scrub and grassland in the 22,000-acre park's rugged canyons, estimated Park Superintendent <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotherham </PERSON>. It also charred part of a wildlife refuge and private land. Temperatures around 90 degrees and variable wind complicated firefighting efforts, officials said. But higher humidity and less wind Sunday helped firefighters get the upper hand on the 10,025-acre Divide Fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Gila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON> said conditions Sunday were favorable to containing the blaze, started by lightning June 30. Higher humidity, lower temperatures and less wind in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> also helped crews fighting fires that had burned more than 40,000 acres of forest, range and brush and most were more than 50 percent contained. Thunderstorms were reported overnight. A 1,000-acre fire in the Grand Canyon briefly threatened President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>'s hunting cabin, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracey </PERSON>. In northeastern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a wind-fanned fire had destroyed 3,500 acres of remote brush land and seven buildings by Sunday, and firefighters constructed a firebreak as wide as an eight-lane highway across its southern path. A separate 2,800-acre brush blaze blamed on arson threatened the <LOCATION> Ventana </LOCATION> wilderness in Big Sur. Between 30 and 50 families evacuated Saturday night from two sparsely populated areas in the 3,500-acre fire's path were allowed to return to their homes Sunday, officials said. The fire, on the eastern slopes of the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, had destroyed three homes, a garage, three barns and numerous sheds and other small structures, officials said. The Butte fire five miles east of <LOCATION> Oroville </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, was brought under control Sunday morning after destroying four homes and six outbuildings, said D.J. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, a state forestry department spokeswoman. A brush fire burned 2,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> about 40 miles east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, sweeping through a campground and the Cuyapaipe Indian Reservation. People were asked to evacuate the campground, and firefighters protected buildings on the reservation. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, a 100-acre fire destroyed at least five homes and forced the evacuation of five subdivisions near <LOCATION> Sugarloaf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> about 25 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, officials said. Archaeologists from around the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> were called to help firefighters at <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in southwestern <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> protect ancient Indian relics from a 700-acre blaze. Numerous lightning-started fires were reported elsewhere around the state. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON>'s fire in the <ORGANIZATION> Bridger-Teton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> of western <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> slowed over the weekend, thanks partly to cooler weather, fire officials say. It was about 60 percent contained Sunday after having burned at least 3,477 acres in five days, according to forest spokesman <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The new government Sunday announced economic austerity measures that included a 53 percent devaluation of the currency and massive utility rate increases in an all-out effort to halt soaring inflation. Earlier Sunday, President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said Argentines must brace for `` a very tough period'' as the government tries to halt inflation approaching 1 million percent a year. `` We have to conduct major surgery without anesthesia,'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> said as he arrived at Government House the morning after he was sworn in. `` If not, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> has no future.'' In a televised speech, Economy Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> said that beginning Monday the austral will sell for 655 per $ 1. He also announced that natural gas rates will rise by 650 percent for industrial users and 200 percent for homeowners. Natural gas is the principal source of energy for home heating in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. State-set rates for electricity, public transportation and other public services will also increase substantially, <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> said in his 20-minute address. But he did not specify amounts or say when they would take effect. Public Works Minister <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Dromi </PERSON> said Saturday that gasoline prices would increase by 500 percent. To help Argentines cope with the increases, the government will roll back the price of bread and other basic foods and set price guidelines, <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> said. In addition, most workers next week will get a special one-time payment equivalent to about $ 13. Businesses raised the price of bread and milk by more than 150 percent on Thursday and Friday in anticipation of government price controls. <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> did not say how long the government price guidelines on a variety of supermarket items would be in effect. Argentines stocked up at supermarkets when they received monthly salaries at the end of June, and car owners lined up at gas stations all weekend to top off their tanks. <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> said the government utility rates were `` absurdly low,'' and that new rates would be `` very stiff.'' <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, who attended a Mass Sunday morning at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> and presided over a military parade, said <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> will have to `` endure a very tough period in order to emerge from this crisis.'' The inflation and the worst recession in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s 173-year history have severely hurt real wages in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> nation of 31 million. Low monetary reserves and a $ 60 billion foreign debt leave <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> little room for easy solutions. The 12-month cost-of-living increase based on June's inflation rate of 114.5 percent amounts to a staggering 948,597 percent. In his inauguration speech Saturday, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> called for national unity. He has gone out of his way since he was elected May 14 to placate the military, smooth relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and coordinate plans with labor unions, business groups and rival political parties. It remains to be seen, however, how Argentines who have tightened belts for several months will react to the measures, and whether <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> will carry them out in the face of public resistance. Labor unions staged general strikes against former President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> when he tried austerity measures last year. The measures triggered looting and rioting in several cities. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is virtually without foreign reserves, except for an estimated $ 1 billion in gold, and tax revenue has shrunk. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> will find it hard to borrow from abroad, as <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> did, because the country is about $ 4.5 billion behind in interest payments on the foreign debt.

 An itinerant painter sought for questioning in the killing of a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> woman and the disappearances of three other women has decided to fight extradition, authorities said Saturday. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 28, was captured Friday by police and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents at <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, after an anonymous tipster told authorities <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> would be meeting an arriving passenger. Police in the <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> said jewelry and other belongings of at least one of the missing women were recovered at the airport from a car stolen in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> allegedly drove to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> police began seeking <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON>, an avid bodybuilder, on June 27 in connection with the disappearance of 24-year-old <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, who was reported missing June 16. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> investigators also said <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> planned a date with <PERSON> Terri </PERSON> <PERSON> Maness </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> on June 7, the night she was strangled and stabbed repeatedly in her home. Police also want to question him about the disappearances of roommates <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusch </PERSON>, both 22, of <LOCATION> Lenexa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. He was seen June 24 at a party given by the women, who were reported missing June 26. `` We found items linking the two women to him,'' <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. `` Credit cards and jewelry identified as belonging to one of the <LOCATION> Lenexa </LOCATION> women were found in his car.'' But authorities said <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> was n't providing additional information about the three missing women. `` He talks a lot,'' and has admitted knowing the women, `` but he's just not giving you anything you can make a case on,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Wichita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> on personal business at the time of <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON>'s arrest. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Rusch </PERSON> was last seen using a bank card machine near <LOCATION> Grandview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. `` We have photos of her from the -LRB- card -RRB- machine and she appeared injured,'' said <PERSON> Keller </PERSON>. She also made withdrawals totaling $ 2,900 to $ 3,200, he said. So far, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said, the three suburban <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> women have not been found and only the body of the <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, woman has been recovered. <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> has not been charged in the slaying or disappearances. <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> is being held on <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> warrants for parole violation and felony theft. He initially agreed to return to <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> to face the charges, but decided Saturday to fight extradition, which can take 60 to 90 days, <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> was convicted at age 16 of fatally bludgeoning a 72-year-old <PERSON> Lansing </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, woman with a railroad spike. <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said <PERSON> Grissom </PERSON> spoke with investigators Friday about unsolved murder cases in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> but he had not admitted being involved in any crimes.

 A boy who was impaled by his neck on an iron spike after he lost his balance and slipped while climbing over a 6-foot-high fence was in serious condition Saturday at a hospital, officials said. The picket went up from under 15-year-old <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON>'s neck and out his mouth, police and fire officials said. Rescue workers were forced to prop him up with a ladder while they cut a section from the fence. `` The fence had to go with him to the emergency room,'' said Fire Department Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who helped with the rescue. Once at the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> rescue workers scrubbed up and worked with the doctors to remove the spike from the boy's mouth, <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. The spike just missed the boy's jugular vein. The accident occurred about 5:30 p.m. near the boy's apartment building in the borough of <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>. The boy dangled from the fence for several minutes before rescue workers arrived. He was conscious through the ordeal, officials said.

 Two strong earthquakes shook the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> area within a minute of each other Sunday morning, swaying office buildings and knocking goods off shelves. Eleven people were reported injured. The first, more powerful earthquake at 11:09 a.m. registered 5.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The second quake was slightly weaker, but no Richter reading was immediately available. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, office buildings swayed. In the city of <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, on the <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> about 80 miles to the southwest, parked motorcycles were knocked over, and canned goods fell from some store shelves. Some of the injuries, which were all blamed on the larger quake, occurred when furniture fell on people in their homes, police said. However, they said no one was reported hospitalized. About 4,000 people were without electricity in the town of <LOCATION> Usami </LOCATION>, police said. The bigger quake was centered in the ocean off the peninsula about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, officials said. Trains on nearby land were delayed for about a half hour, a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railways </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said it was still investigating damage. At least 17,760 small quakes, 380 of them strong enough to be felt by residents, have shaken the <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> since Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The quakes have caused burst water pipes, gas lines leaks, and damages to roads and roofs. The open-ended <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale measures the magnitude of a quake at its epicenter. An increase of one unit means a tenfold increase in ground motion. A quake that measures 5 can cause considerable damage, and one that measures 6 can cause severe damage.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set out Sunday on a journey to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, saying <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` now dreams of being whole and free'' after four decades of division put promising delicacy in fostering that movement. In a departure ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` My visit underscores the growing importance our nation sees in the changing face of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Trying to encourage political and economic freedom in communist <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was flying first to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> for a two-day stop, where he will meet with government leaders and address the Parliament. In the wake of recent elections, nearly half of its lawmakers are members of the once-banned Solidarity union. Meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described the diplomatic situation `` as a little delicate.'' He said he wanted to avoid an appearance of trying to put Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` in a box by throwing strains on the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' But, he added, `` I'm not going to back off my principles just because it might offend Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. I will give my aspirations for a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free. What we want to do is encourage them.'' Leaders of both the governments and democratic movements in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` do n't want overpromise,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He declined to discuss an aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but said some specifics would be offered. He also will visit the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> and deliver a speech outside the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard where the Solidarity labor movement was born. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will fly to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Tuesday, becoming the first American president to visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. After two nights in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will go on to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for a bicentennial celebration of the French Revolution and the annual economic summit of the seven major industrialized countries. Concluding a 10-day trip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will stop in the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> for one day, the first president ever to visit there. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his journey `` underscores the tremendous changes, challenges and opportunities ahead of us.'' He described <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as `` nations on the threshold of a new era, nations where the spirit of freedom is strong. `` In both countries,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` we're witnessing remarkable changes, welcome developments no one would have though possible even a year ago. `` New voices are shaping the course of national affairs and both countries are on the path towards economic rebirth and political pluralism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He said that `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is at a turning point. `` A continent cruelly divided for more than four decades now dreams of being whole and free,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Our task is clear: to see that we mend old divisions, that we fulfill the decades-old dream and that the new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> emerges _ secure, prosperous, peaceful and free,'' the president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was in the midst of change, `` a time of unprecedented opportunity for peace, prosperity and freedom.'' At the summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with the leaders of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. He said that in addition to economic problems, the leaders will grapple with environmental issues such as global warming, deforestation and ocean pollution. `` We know there are no easy solutions,'' the president said. `` But, provided we work together, I'm confident we can find common solutions to problems none of us can solve alone.''

<HEAD>Officials Want Cleaner Toilets to Lure Tourists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tourism officials have started a campaign to clean up the nation's public bathrooms, setting up a phone hotline for complaints and even peering into toilet bowls. The officials are preparing for `` Visit Malaysia Year 1990.'' They are trying to address a common complaint of tourists, who say the country's public bathrooms are dirty, poorly maintained, and lacking such amenities as toilet paper and towels. Some have also complained about unflushed toilets. On Saturday, a 10-member team from the capital's <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, led by agency chief <PERSON> Zainol </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriffin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pawanchee </PERSON>, inspected bathrooms and kitchens in four hotels in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. The New Sunday Times said three hotels were cited for failing to keep their kitchens clean, while another was warned to keep its bathroom and kitchen tidy. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Zainol </PERSON> as saying many public bathrooms, especially in shopping complexes, are dirty and missing hand dryers, towels and toilet paper. In most complexes, a small fee is charged to use the bathroom. To boost the campaign, the Minister of Culture and Tourism, <PERSON> Sabbaruddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chik </PERSON>, on June 30 made a surprise check on public bathrooms in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. He took the press in tow. A picture in a local paper showed him gazing into a toilet bowl. The Ministry has also opened a `` Toilet Operations Room'' for the public to phone in complaints. On Saturday, it handled 30. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Straits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> put the issue this way in an editorial July 2: `` Anyone who has ever had to hold his breath in a public toilet will agree that unbelievable as it may seem, there is a pressing need to educate Malaysians on how to use toilets and how to keep them clean.'' A similar toilet campaign also is under way in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. Beginning July 1, anyone caught failing to flush a public toilet faced a fine of up to $ 77. Repeat offenders could be fined as much as $ 515.

In that movie, the American hero wipes out Vietnamese communists by the dozens as he searches for American prisoners of war in the country.

 Two explosions rocked a town in northern <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> state Sunday, two days after clashes between Buddhists and Moslems injured at least 25 people, news reports said. No one was killed or injured in the pre-dawn blasts in Leh, according to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> news agencies. `` The explosions occurred at deserted places during the night,'' <ORGANIZATION> PTI </ORGANIZATION> quoted Leh police chief G.J. <PERSON> Pandit </PERSON> as saying. Leh, a city of 100,000 people, is about 450 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Authorities on Friday imposed an indefinite curfew on the city after clashes between Buddhists and Moslems. Authorities said the brawls were sparked by an argument between two youths. Several shops were set on fire and taxi drivers were dragged from their vehicles and beaten, the news agencies said. The army was deployed to help restore order after police using tear gas and batons failed to stop the fighting, the agencies said. About 90 million Indians, or 11 percent of the country's 880 million people, are Moslem. <LOCATION> Jammu-Kashmir </LOCATION> is the only state where Moslems are in a majority. But in Leh, more than 90 percent of the people are <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>. Only about 6 percent are Moslem.

<TEXT>
 Two strong earthquakes hit southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> within a minute of each other Sunday, triggering landslides and injuring at least 18 people, police said. They were among thousands of tremors that have rocked the area in 10 days. The first quake, registering 5.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, occurred at 11:09 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The second was slightly weaker, but its precise magnitude was not immediately known. The first quake was centered in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Atami </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, officials said. It was the strongest among at least 19,363 tremors _ 433 of them strong enough to be felt by residents _ that have shaken the <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> since June 30, the agency said. Landslides occurred at 16 places and roads were cracked in 10 places in <LOCATION> Ito </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Izu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, said a police official of <LOCATION> Shizuoka </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prefecture </LOCATION>, or state. Some of the injuries, all blamed on the larger quake, occurred when furniture fell on people in their homes, police said. Two people were burned from spattering oil in a kitchen, said the police official on condition of anonymity. The official said 2,600 households lost electricity for four hours. <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, a railway official, said the region's high-speed commuter trains were stopped for up to 61 minutes, delaying about 20,000 people The agency gave no reason for the increased seismic activity. The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated areas, while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage.

<HEAD>Beef in Her Past, She's the Secretary for Meat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> is a beef person. She grew up on it and remains a great fan of the standing rib roast. She was the first woman ever to head the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. She is a fifth-generation cattle raiser. Now she regulates the industry she once promoted. But she rejects the idea that as assistant secretary of agriculture for marketing and inspection services, she might someday have to choose between her loyalties to beef and her responsibilities to government. Meat has been Topic A all her life. Her husband, <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON>, also comes from a cattleman's heritage. Both she and her husband come from families that have raised cattle for generations. She is no stranger to blue jeans and hard work. While she had to separate herself from the operation to accept the $ 80,700 presidential appointment earlier this year, her husband and son still run a 500-head, 4,500-acre ranch near <LOCATION> Wacahoota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. She was an equal partner `` I always knew what <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> was paying for corn,'' she once told an interviewer. She was a conservative Democrat _ she underscores the `` conservative'' _ until 1988, when she campaigned for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. She ran twice for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> as a Democrat, but lost both races. Then Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 50, became involved in beef politics as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, one of the most powerful agricultural lobbies. She helped drag a reluctant industry toward feeding and breeding changes that produced leaner meat, but it was a struggle. `` We were very slow to respond,'' she says. `` You could see the train coming.'' `` I really do enjoy beef,'' she says and usually eats it once a day. `` I am not a great lover of fish-fish,'' she says. She has come to accept it but wo n't cook it: `` too messy.'' She'll eat it when <PERSON> Cedric </PERSON> cooks it, which, she says, he does well. Her new job puts her in the midst of a dozen arguments, including controversies over meat inspections _ the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration wanted the industry to do more, and the government less _ and over <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s consumption of red meat. The health side of government says Americans eat too much of it. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>, in a study that came out last March, concluded in the most comprehensive evaluation ever of the effects of diet on health that this country consumes too much fat and gets too much of it from meat. The study advised `` eating lean meat in smaller and fewer portions.'' `` No, I do n't think we consume too much,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in an interview. She said the beef industry already has addressed the fat issue by putting leaner beef on the market. `` We're producing a product that does not have the fat -LRB- it once did -RRB-,'' she said. `` We recognized that it was the fat that was the culprit, not the product. And we have addressed that in genetics and breeding. You can buy lean meat.'' At the same time, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> endorsed labeling the fat content of meat _ a position that could raise hackles among cattlemen. `` Labeling has certain strong advantages,'' she said. `` The consumer wants to know. The only way they're going to know is to be able to read something that -LRB- says -RRB- this is what the product has in it.'' It is a sensitive issue. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, director of nutrition policy for Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s old organization, the 35,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Cattlemen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said it will be discussed at the group's meeting in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, this month `` Proud producers might view the issue as a positive opportunity to highlight the nutritional density of the product, beef,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Winslow </PERSON>, adding that her own recommendation will be for labels that show how much fat remains after cooking _ after fat has been trimmed and drained away. She said the stress on fat has turned attention away from the high iron, zinc and vitamin B-12 contents of beef. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>'s pro-label stand and her support for federal inspection of seafood _ an issue on which the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has yet to take a stand _ wins applause from the ever-vigilant consumer movement. `` For an industry person, she's more of an activist than you'd expect,'' says <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> `` She has an understanding about what can be done. She has been out front on fish inspection.'' But on some other food issues in her domain, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> tends toward caution. She is waiting for more study to be conducted before taking a stand on whether meat producers who give their cattle no hormones or other growth-enhancing drugs should be able to label their product `` organic'' or `` natural.'' Some cattlemen who have been using a `` natural'' label and who have found a market among health-conscious consumers say the government has been trying to get them to drop the label. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said her discomfort with the label is that `` we have never defined ` natural.' Remember that every animal in order to be bred has hormone in it. The problem that has arisen is, does the consumer understand this. You want to know that your label is truthful.'' On veal issues, Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> dodged questions, saying she was n't familiar with them The Center for Science in the Public Interest and other consumer groups contend that the way some veal calves are raised _ kept in dark pens so small the calf ca n't turn around and fed only a liquid diet to keep the meat light-colored _ are inhumane. High residues of antibiotics have been found in veal, the center's <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> told a congressional subcommittee on June 6. Mrs. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said she knows nothing about raising veal calves and will have to do her homework on that.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president on Sunday gave Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> a mandate to create the nation's 49th postwar government, and it appeared the five-time premier would easily form a coalition. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has been without a government since May 19, when Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> resigned following criticism of his leadership by the No. 2 party in the governing coalition, the Socialists. After President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> summoned him Sunday morning to receive the mandate, <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> said he would begin trying to form a government. However, he said his task might be delayed by preparations for this week's meeting of the seven major industrialized nations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>, like <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, belongs to the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, who have dominated Italian politics since World War II. The <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mita </ORGANIZATION> coalition apparently fell because of jockeying by the Socialists, led by popular former Premier <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> said he would not oppose <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>, newspapers reported. <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> have worked closely in several governments. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>'s policies would likely continue in an <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> government. The editor of the <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Repubblica </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalfari </PERSON>, noted in a front-page editorial that <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> and the leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Forlani </PERSON>, now hold the same positions as they did 17 years ago. `` We are therefore about to turn back the clock of politics,'' he said. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> said he would work to revive the coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Socialists, Republicans, Liberals and <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> that has governed in recent years. He said he was particularly concerned that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> be ready for 1992, when <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> members are to eliminate all trade barriers among themselves. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> is considered to come from the `` conservative'' wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, while <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> is a `` liberal.'' However, the labels can be misleading. For example, while <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> is considered close to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, the premier-designate also has very good relations with the Communists, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s second-largest party, which has been in the opposition for more than 40 years. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>, 70, has been prominent in Italian government since World War II, serving as premier twice in 1972-73 and three times successively in 1976-79.

 A turtle who had the misfortune to be run over was at least lucky enough to be the victim of a veterinarian, who got a dentist to mend its broken shell. The vet, Dr. <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON>, said she injured the painted turtle with her car recently near the animal hospital where she works. Examining the turtle, she found its undershell broken into two pieces, but did n't know how to fix it. A dentist who by chance was at the hospital for a rare consultation on root canal work on a dog overheard Ms. <PERSON> McCoy </PERSON> discussing her problem. He stepped in and came to the rescue. `` That was just what he needed ... some dental acrylic,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calabro </PERSON>. He splinted the shell and glued it back together with a baby-blue substance normally used for making dentures and repairing teeth. The turtle was up and about in no time and sent on its way. `` Getting hit by a car, going to the vet, going to the dentist _ that's a pretty scary day,'' <PERSON> Calabro </PERSON> said.

 If eating two gallons of ice cream in one day is your idea of fun, you may have a treat in store. <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>'s Grand Ice Cream wants 20 adults and three children to help determine which flavors will fill freezers next year. Those who write the best entries will be flown to company headquarters in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> for the Sept. 15 event. Tasters are trained to rate flavor, texture and color. Then, spoon in hand, they visit 25 tasting stations, sampling as much as necessary to rate each new flavor on a 1-to-10 scale. `` Then we turn them loose to do some real eating,'' said <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gammill </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON>'s publicist. `` It's incredible what these people put away.'' The company's official taster, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, says he does n't feel threatened by the non-professionals, even though in the past couple of years they have picked several flavors `` that were big hits the minute they were introduced. Last year's bunch, chosen from among 15,000 applicants, consumed an average of two gallons of ice cream a day, he said. Along with a plane flight and hotel stay, winners will receive their weight in ice cream. But, said <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, `` we have n't decided whether to weigh them before or after.''

 It was a big job for such a small place, but the 5,251 residents here pulled it off _ they're geared up and ready for the nearly 1,500 pitchers expected for the 1989 World Horseshoe Tournament. Organizers had to raise $ 40,000 toward cash prizes and trophies. Volunteer supporters held raffles, dances and even a chili cookoff to raise money.

 Six months after he defected to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by jumping off a Polish ship, 42-year-old <PERSON> Wieslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> is doing just fine in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, thanks. He's even got a new job at a computer company. `` In my wildest dreams I never anticipated having this kind of job,'' said <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON>, whose English is coming along but who spoke with the help of an interpreter. `` I had heard that there were opportunities here but I had no idea how much.'' <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> was one of 48 sailors who fled from three different Polish vessels in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> over several days in January. All said they were members of the then-banned Solidarity union. <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> and the 47 others have applied for but not yet received asylum in a political climate that is changing almost daily. President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left Sunday for a trip to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It will include a two-day stop in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> where he was to address a newly elected <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, nearly half of whose members belong to Solidarity _ an outlaw just six short months ago. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> are `` nations on the threshold of a new era, nations where the spirit of freedom is strong,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Sunday before leaving from <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> says he likes it here. `` There is absolutely no question that I would defect again,'' he said during an interview last week at the <ORGANIZATION> Polish-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, as he sat smoking Marlboros, wearing blue jeans, Reeboks and a T-shirt. He said he loves his new job testing computer modules at <ORGANIZATION> Teradyne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. But like the other sailors, he worries about his immigration status, and whether his wife and two children in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will be permitted to join him. The 48 have almost all been interviewed by officials with the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, but have yet to hear whether they'll be granted asylum, said <PERSON> Cathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> MacInnes </PERSON>, the city adviser on immigrant rights who handled the Poles' applications. Many of them have found jobs in the fishing industry in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, while others are working at hotels and factories in <LOCATION> Greater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, the mayor's liaison to the Polish-American community. <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said the new arrivals got help from the community and a local church and had no trouble finding jobs. `` They went off to work right away. They refused any type of government assistance,'' <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said. At least five of the Polish sailors are working as machinists at <ORGANIZATION> Varian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a vacuum products company in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, making up to $ 9 an hour, production manager <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Grenon </PERSON> said. `` They have a terrific work ethic, the old-fashioned work ethic,'' said <PERSON> Grenon </PERSON>. `` The one problem is the language problem but we've provided them some English-as-a-second-language training and they're coming along.'' <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> was a radio operator aboard the Kantar, which pulled into <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> just a few days after Polish sailors had jumped another ship. Nervous about the potential for more betrayals, the <PERSON> Kantar </PERSON>'s captain was ordered not to dock but to pump fuel aboard from another ship. <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> and the others defected by jumping aboard the refueling ship. As the sailors prepared to leave, the captain stood in front of them and warned them of the ramifications, <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> explained through <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>. `` As I looked beyond him and saw the skyline of the city -LRB- I was -RRB- thinking about what my future would be,'' he said. He jumped. <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> said his American co-workers are sympathetic and helpful, but can not conceive of how difficult life is in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Most surprising, he said, is the absence of paranoia in the workplace. `` I come and go as I please ...,'' he said. `` I can speak freely to my co-workers. I can speak freely to you.'' And in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Albinski </PERSON> can let another secret off his chest: He took the shipboard job only for the money. `` I'm not a seaman,'' he said. `` And I'm really not partial to the sea.'' But the merchant seamen's fate depends on whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe they are freedom-seekers or mainly just interested in better economic opportunity. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whelan </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said at the time of the defections that officials would consider <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s political climate, as well as the lengths the sailors had to go to to leave their homeland.

 About 500 residents returned to their homes early Sunday after being evacuated for several hours when a nitric acid leak sent a vapor cloud over a wide area. The leak in a containment tank at a construction site in southern Poplar Bluff was discovered by a security guard at 8:45 p.m. Saturday. The evacuations were ordered when authorities feared wind might carry fumes from the acid to residents' homes. The leak was caused by a loose fitting in the 4,000-gallon tank at the site, where a factory is under construction, said <PERSON> Hercell </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> director. Workers put lime on the acid to neutralize it, and the evacuations were called off about 6 a.m. Sunday, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The tank had been filled Friday, and workers were transferring 1,500 gallons from the outside tank to another tank inside the plant when the leak occurred, a plant spokesman said. The guard who discovered the leak, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, 34, was in stable condition Sunday at Doctor's <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. No other injuries were reported. In an interview at the hospital, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said he was finishing his second round of the nearly completed factory when `` I noticed a steam coming out of the ground outside. It looked like something bubbling out of the concrete.'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said the vapors smelled like battery acid. `` I got a pretty good hit, backed off and just fell down,'' <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said. `` It burned my throat and I started coughing. I was OK until I lit a cigarette.

 For the first time in almost 11 years, <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> countries and major Western allies are seriously thinking about a world with <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> at peace. Though major barriers remain, last week's meeting of 12 foreign ministers here underlined that virtually all the major outside players are determined to bring about peace. They showed their commitment to finding a settlement despite differences among warring factions in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. They pinned high hopes on talks among the Cambodians starting July 24 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and on an international peace conference starting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on July 30. In <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> <PERSON> Seng </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> said the <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> conflict, which has preoccupied the region, was winding down. `` We have already begun to look beyond <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>'' to economic issues, he said after the conference ended Saturday. To examine new directions, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Siddhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Savetsila </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> proposed a summit of the group, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, for next year. `` The important thing is that there has been a strong show of consensus of <ORGANIZATION> ASEAN </ORGANIZATION> and its dialogue partners on the need for a comprehensive settlement'' in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, said a senior <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The dialogue partners, or allies, included the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, and the 12-nation European Community. Nations at the <LOCATION> Brunei </LOCATION> conference said the pullout of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s troops from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> must be internationally supervised, the Cambodian factions must share power in a provisional government leading to elections, and an international body must also guarantee the peace <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has pledged to withdraw all 60,000 to 70,000 troops by Sept. 30. Regional leaders are trying to avoid what they call `` an Afghanistan-type settlement.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> pulled its last soldiers from that country in February, but the Soviet-armed government is still fighting the U.S.-backed guerrillas. Vying for power in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> are the Vietnam-installed government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> and the guerrilla coalition led by Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>, which includes the communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The danger of prolonged civil war after a Vietnamese withdrawal is very real. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON> refuses to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> in even a provisional government. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>, with up to 40,000 fighters, reportedly has stocked arms for a major assault after Vietnamese troops leave. The <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> killed hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> from 1975 until <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s 1978 invasion ousted it from power. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON> again refused <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s calls to make a separate peace without the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hun </PERSON> <PERSON> Sen </PERSON>'s side `` is very uncompromising, so there is no reason for us to be compromising,'' the prince said at his home in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Still, outsiders feel guarded optimism because of the momentum of diplomatic initiatives over the past two years. Many of these were undertaken by Vietnamese reformers intent on rebuilding their own country's economy and ending its international isolation. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which arms the rebels, has also grown more conciliatory on the issue in recent years, especially in toning down its backing for the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which is <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s major ally, has told <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> it supports a major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> role in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, even though <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> opposes it, according to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>.

 The Exxon Valdez, responsible for polluting hundreds of miles of Alaskan shoreline, will have an environmentalist at the controls Tuesday when it enters <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> for repairs. Capt. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> harbor pilot who will steer the damaged tanker to a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipbuilding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> dock, is a member of the sometimes militant environmental group <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> is a critic of many oil company maritime policies, but on Tuesday, his primary focus will be to bring the crippled <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> safely into port. The ship that caused the nation's worst oil spill was towed from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> by tugs, but for greater maneuverability <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> will bring it through the bay under its own power. Exxon officials said they have no problems with <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>'s membership in <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> `` He's entitled to his opinion,'' said <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Chassin </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` There are people in Exxon who belong to the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. I'm sure he'll drive that ship in as professionally as he knows how.'' <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a seaman for 42 years, said he comes from a family of mariners _ his grandfather and father also were sailors _ and his concern for the oceanic environment developed naturally. He believes the risk of oil spills has increased with crew reductions in recent years on the more sophisticated tankers. `` You can build the strongest ship in the world but if you do n't do the job right and you have an accident, you're going to have an oil spill, period,'' <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said `` Where you're going to stop it is by making sure the people operating these ships are operating them safely and have enough people to do the job.'' The former captain of the Valdez has been accused of drinking on the job. <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> also said he believes the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> accident would never have occurred if a qualified pilot had been aboard to guide the ship through the sound. The pilot who had helped guide the ship through Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> had left it a few miles before the accident occurred March 24, as regulations allowed. `` I may be biased, but there should have been an Alaskan pilot on board,'' <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said. `` They're more familiar with the area. I guarantee you if there had been one on, it would n't have happened.'' <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> will take him out to the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> by helicopter Monday so he can familiarize himself with the ship and its handling. `` Given that the ship is damaged, I'm not really sure how it's going to handle,'' he said `` Suppose there is a jagged piece of steel down there someplace I do n't know about? It could have an effect on how the ship steers.'' `` I'm doing it just to be absolutely certain in my own mind ... that the ship can handle OK,'' he said. `` There's no one more interested in trying to keep this area clean than I am, believe me.''

 Police trying to cram thousands of soccer fans into a section of <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in 1982 created a `` human mincer'' that killed as many as 340 people, a newspaper said in disclosing details of the world's worst soccer disaster. Sovietsky Sport, the official newspaper of the government's Sports Committee, accused authorities of covering up the disaster and said it was disclosing the tragedy now `` so as not to forget people who loved sports until the grave. The Oct. 20, 1982 incident had been reported before, but a death toll and other details were never released in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A front-page investigative story in <LOCATION> Sovietsky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sport </LOCATION> on Saturday said parents believed there were as many as 340 deaths at <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Luzhniki section. The newspaper repeated that figure Sunday in another article about the incident. `` According to our information _ and no other information has been provided to the public _ a human mincer at <LOCATION> Luzhniki </LOCATION> on that day pulverized 340 lives. In the twinkling of an eye, interior troops and police cordoned off the stadium, and also quickly surrounded the tragedy,'' the newspaper said. The account said that because only 10,000 tickets had been sold to the match between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spartak </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION> of the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in the 100,000-seat stadium, management decided to cram all the fans into one section. Police ringed the section, and all but one staircase was locked `` to save trouble to the police, cleaners,'' the newspaper reported. Police pushed fans toward the exit a few minutes before the end of the game to prevent a jam at the nearby subway station, it said. But when the final _ and only _ goal was scored, some fans tried to return and collided with outgoing fans on stairs that had become covered with ice in the 14-degree weather. `` It was something terrible,'' <PERSON> Volodya </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreyev </PERSON>, who survived the accident, told the newspaper. `` We could n't move from where we were standing, and the crowd was pushing from above and below. It was no longer possible to control the people who had gone crazy.'' Sovietsky Sport said the parents of fans who failed to return home after the match received no information from police and had to search hospital morgues themselves. The bodies were not released for burial for 13 days, the newspaper reported. Five days after the disaster, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> quoted semi-official Soviet sources as saying more than 20 people died and dozens were injured in a collision of fans on a ramp. A Soviet newspaper reported casualties at the time, but did not specify whether people were killed or injured and did not give a number. Sovietsky Sport reported on April 18 _ three days after 95 soccer fans were killed in a crush at <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sheffield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> _ that dozens of people were trampled to death in the 1982 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> incident. The biggest loss of life previously reported at a soccer match was on May 24, 1964, when rioting left nearly 300 dead in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, in a game between <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The worst single-incident sports disaster in modern history occurred when an estimated 604 people were killed after stands at the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> racecourse collapsed and caught fire in February 1918. Sovietsky Sports said a minor stadium official was blamed for the 1982 tragedy and sentenced to 18 months of `` corrective work,'' but mostly the victims were blamed for alleged unruly behavior. Ever since the disaster, no soccer matches have been held in <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> at the end of October because authorities are afraid survivors will place flowers on the field as a sign of protest. Readers suggested a committee be set up to investigate the tragedy and that a meeting be held at the site Oct. 20 to commemorate the tragedy, the newspaper said Sunday. The account was the latest disclosure by a Soviet media that has seized upon President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, to report long hushed-up Soviet disasters.

<HEAD>Housing Protest in Zurich Turns Violent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse 150 people who erected barricades and smashed windows in a protest over housing shortages in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, authorities said Sunday. The protest Saturday night caused $ 100,000 in damage, injured three officers and led to the arrests of 19 people, police said. A police statement said officers used tear gas and rubber bullets around midnight after demonstrators began smashing the shop windows in downtown <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> and erecting barricades of garbage cans in the streets. The Swiss Journalists Union charged that police attacked journalists to prevent them from covering the violence. The union demanded an investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosza </PERSON> said he was covering the disturbances when police chased him into a restaurant. `` They threw tables to the ground and three of them beat me,'' he said. <PERSON> Rosza </PERSON>, who was treated for head and arm injuries, said a fourth policeman sprayed tear gas in his face. A police spokesman denied that authorities attacked the journalist. Demonstrations demanding a solution to <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>'s acute housing shortage, especially of reasonably priced apartments, led to riots in March that police described as the most serious disturbances since the start of the decade.

 Cadets from the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, in gray tunics and dark blue plumed hats, are giving the French a taste of American marching music in this week's bicentennial festivities. The 45-member VMI band has been in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> since July 6 to represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at several events marking the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> VMI </ORGANIZATION> cadets and other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marching bands and majorettes wowed a crowd of several thousand at <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> City Hall with a display of jazzy music, fancy steps and spinning batons. French schools and universities have no marching bands, and the brassy art is considered quintessentially American. The account in Sunday's editions of the weekly <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dimanche </ORGANIZATION> noted that following the <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> Centennial Band in cowboy hats and blue jeans `` were the ringing tones, a bit more warlike, of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, whose representatives were sporting caps topped with blue plumes.'' Also participating in Saturday's display at City Hall were bands from <ORGANIZATION> James </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dudley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> -RRB- High School and <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> -LRB- Ind. -RRB- High School. The most exotic touch came from the <ORGANIZATION> Touch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kyle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twirling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The Journal du <PERSON> Dimanche </PERSON> tried to explain `` le twirling'' for its readers, describing it as `` manipulation of a baton, involving at once juggling, acrobatics and dance.'' Saturday's performance was part of a daylong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> salute to the French bicentennial, which climaxes Friday on the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789. VMI was founded 150 years ago on the model of the <ORGANIZATION> Ecole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnique </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> military engineering academy _ established during the revolution _ whose graduates still dominate top jobs in French industry and technology. A tour of the Ecole Polytechnique was on the schedule for the visiting cadets.

 A court sentenced a local <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official to death for selling a fake name-brand liquor, a report said Sunday, dramatizing the party's determination to root out corruption that students recently protested. Six other officials were expelled from the party in separate corruption cases as the ruling party tried to clean up an image badly tarnished by nepotism, bribe-taking and black marketeering. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily said a court in the southeastern province of <LOCATION> Guizhou </LOCATION> gave <LOCATION> Tongren </LOCATION> district party secretary <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingxing </PERSON> the death sentence for selling fake maotai, a fiery sorghum liquor. The paper said <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> earned `` staggering profits'' of $ 50,800. At least 26 people have been executed since the army cracked down on pro-democracy protesters, whose demands included an end to official corruption. <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> was the first party official to be sentenced to death under a new anti-corruption campaign announced after the crackdown. Other such campaigns in recent years have failed, partly because offenders usually were disciplined by the party rather than put on trial. The protests that shook <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from April until June gave the party a strong incentive to try again. The student slogan that won the most sympathy from the public was `` Down with corruption,'' and the posters that were most copied were those detailing examples of nepotism among top leaders. The party newspaper, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, said two party members were expelled in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province and several others were put under supervision or criticized for arranging prostitutes for visiting businessmen. In another case, it said four men who had been party members for more than 40 years were expelled in <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> province for profiteering and bribe-taking. There were no new reports of arrests connected with the protests. According to a count by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, more than 2,000 arrests have been reported nationwide by the official media, but <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources said they believed that many had been arrested in the capital alone. The official media blasted Western suggestions that with time, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will move away from socialism, and it lectured its citizens that the best way to improve their lives is by raising production. In a harsh half-page commentary, the People's Daily accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> radio of supporting the protesters. `` This is yet another odious demonstration of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s crude interference in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s internal affairs,'' it said, `` and -LRB- of -RRB- the revival of the old dream of the American anti-communist monopoly capitalist class of promoting a peaceful evolution in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'' toward capitalism. Such venemous criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was common during the 1960s, when revolutionary leader <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> repeatedly claimed that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> planned an attack, but it has not been seen in the Chinese media for years. Other political phrases from the 1960s also have reappeared. The People's Daily commentary said the protests showed that class struggle still exists in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Other newspapers have urged students to learn from the workers, peasants and soldiers _ three `` good'' classes.

<TEXT>
 A little more than a year ago, government riot police attacked striking steelworkers led by the banned independent Solidarity trade union. Last week, the leader of that strike took a seat in parliament. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s communist government, struggling with a dire economic situation, has been pushed into an amazing political about-face that still has people shaking their heads in disbelief. `` It is not that the economic situation is getting worse from year to year or quarter to quarter,'' wrote journalist <PERSON> Tomasz </PERSON> <PERSON> Jezioranski </PERSON>, `` but by now we have reached the state where it is deteriorating almost from week to week.'' Some might say day to day, as they list what is not available in the market, how much egg prices increased or how long an assembly line has been idled for lack of a simple machinery part. Whether viewed in terms of the $ 39 billion national debt to the West or the lack of a medicine for a sick child, the economic crisis has fueled a year of tumult in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Election victories by Solidarity have given the union a big voice in determining who will assume <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new presidency in the coming weeks: Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, his ally Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> or some other communist candidate. There is also a possibility that <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s Solidarity will accept the prime minister's post with the job of forming the next government _ a non-communist cabinet functioning in what remains constitutionally a communist state. These decisions are to be taken soon after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit to the country Monday and Tuesday. The communist government and the opposition now find themselves looking together for ways to address a mind-boggling range of economy-linked fiscal, social and environmental problems. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Golden Age was in the 16th century, when it controlled a vast swath of central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> from the Baltic to the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. But undermined by successive wars and a weak government structure, it eventually fell victim to autocratic neighbors. <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prussia </LOCATION> divided up <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> among themselves and the Polish state ceased to exist for 123 years from 1795 until the end of World War I in 1918. Recreated for a brief but warmly remembered interwar independence, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> next suffered more than any other nation in World War II, losing 6 million people, including 3 million Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust. Already weighed down by the rubble of massive wartime devastation, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> under <ORGANIZATION> communist </ORGANIZATION> rule has fallen further and further behind the European standard of its past. The workers' state revolted in 1980, with Solidarity emerging as the first legal independent trade union in the Soviet bloc. But the burst of freedom, and the surge of creative economic and cultural energy that accompanied it, did not last. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, with the threat of a general strike and the hint of potential Soviet intervention, declared martial law on Dec. 13, 1981. Solidarity was repressed and its leaders imprisoned. The West cut investment in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the nation's spirit sagged, and the economy stagnated. During a second wave of strikes in August 1988, the government proposed `` round-table'' talks with the Solidarity-led opposition, realizing it could not hope to solve <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s problems without the opposition it had so long sought to crush. The communist leadership decided in a story January plenum that Solidarity could be legalized again, clearing the way for talks that culminated with a historic April reform accord. The agreement provided for unprecedentedly democratic elections, with independents allowed to vie for 161 of the 460 seats in the existing parliament, or Sejm, and all 100 seats in a new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Solidarity won all but one of the seats. Now, once-jailed Solidarity activists are legislators and the formerly underground press has a sanctioned daily newspaper. Roadblocks to private economic enterprises are coming down and the borders are open to foreign ventures. Encouraged by the atmosphere of reform, the West has renewed contact that the Polish government hopes will lead to help with restructuring of the debt. There is some cautious optimism among the 38 million Poles. But there is also a painful awareness that even with political freedom, inflation is now at an unofficial 100 percent or more annually, meaningful purchases are more likely transacted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars than the national currency and the national budget deficit is likely to grow to six times the planned 1 trillion zlotys.

 The Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday turned down an appeal for mercy from a decorated war hero condemned to die before a firing squad for drug trafficking, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said. The court also upheld the death sentences of three other former officers and the prison sentences of 10 other defendants accused of smuggling tons of cocaine and marijuana into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The only avenue of appeal left is the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON>, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said the council had agreed to hear the appeal because of the severity of the sentences. A court-martial Friday condemned former Division Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>, 57, to death. Also sentenced to die were three men identified as among <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s closest collaborators _ ex-Col. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Guardia </PERSON>, ex-Maj. <PERSON> Armado </PERSON> <PERSON> Padron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. The military tribunal handed out prison sentences ranging from 10 years to 30 years to 10 other defendants in a case that reached into the highest levels of the Cuban military and government. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> is a veteran of the Cuban revolution who went on to receive his nation's highest medal, <LOCATION> Hero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, for his service as a field commander in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in 1978 and in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in 1987-1988. He headed <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s military advisory mission to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in 1985-1986. In addition to the drug charges, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was accused of corruption during his command of troops in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and of smuggling ivory, diamonds and other contraband. He and the others were accused of betraying President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and the moral standards of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s communist revolution. All were stripped of their rank and decorations and expelled from the military and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> has said the defendants admitted their guilt but asked for mercy because of their records. The <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government has said it would make an example of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and his cohorts and it has portrayed their illicit activities as an aberration. It also admitted that the case came to light in part because of persistent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> had become a way station for drug traffickers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs surveillance aircraft watched a plane drop bales of cocaine to a speedboat in Cuban waters Friday, the day <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and the others were sentenced. `` Two MiG fighters came onto the scene and protected the Cuban airspace,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs special agent-in-charge for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The next day, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents found the 37-foot speedboat abandoned in <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> south of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. It had nearly 1,600 pounds of cocaine worth about $ 10 million aboard. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and the others allegedly arranged for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel to fly cocaine into <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for transfer to boats bound for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>U.S. Cable Network to Televise Britain's House of Commons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British are coming, this time on <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION>, which believes the sometimes raucous doings of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> may prove entertaining to television viewers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If you're into, what do you call it, shock television, it may just be your cup of tea,'' says <PERSON> Neville </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON>, a member of Commons. `` All TV viewers may see is a lot of arguing, disruptive, noisy behavior and name-calling to their colleagues on the other side of the aisle.'' Beginning in November, the <ORGANIZATION> Cable-Satellite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin televising action in the House of Commons, feeding the parliamentary deliberations _ live on occasion _ to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by satellite. While some might say the decision is just another manifestation of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s long-held fascination with things English, <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> sees it differently. `` One of our reasons for even doing this, except for the fact that what the British do is interesting, is an opportunity for us to take a look at comparative government,'' <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> said in an interview last week. But <PERSON> Lamb </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cable audiences accustomed to <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION>'s no-frills, gavel-to-gavel coverage of congressional debate, committee hearings, call-in and talk shows and news conferences may experience some shocks. `` I think Americans are going to love it,'' he said. `` They use humor a lot more than our <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> does in our debating. I think they'll be surprised how informal some of the remarks are.'' For example, <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> viewers will likely get to witness British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s trips to the Commons, where, as leader of the majority <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, she must submit to 15 minutes of questioning each Tuesday and Thursday by the leader of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The equivalent here would be turning on the TV and finding President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> being grilled on government policy by the leading Democrat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> resisted the move to allow televising of Commons. Nonetheless, it's members approved the plan overwhelmingly on June 12, even though it took 22 years to debate the matter. Some British pundits suggested Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was reluctant because her voice tends to become a bit shrill when she's under the lash in Commons. She also wears glasses during those appearances, and observers claimed she feared it would not be good for her image being seen on the telly with specs. But she also could win a sympathy vote among viewers if the mostly male <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members are openly derisive, according to the pundits. Like <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the British lawmakers have decreed that the cameras shall not pan away from the speaker to show `` occasions of grave disorder'' or demonstrations in the galleries. Even so, the off-camera noises may be considerable. British lawmakers tend to be much more rowdy than their <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counterparts. `` Some of our members are very badly behaved,'' said <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON>, `` and I think that they will continue to be _ perhaps even worse _ as a result of television.'' As <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> writer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> observed in a recent dispatch, `` The members of the opposing parties face each other across a very narrow aisle, and as the leaders exchange barbs, the back-benchers often bellow what are politely called ` animal noises' at opposition speakers. In a recent call-in show on <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Trotter </PERSON> said he finds the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> much more genteel and orderly. `` If you listen to the participants on the floor of your <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, you see civilized, organized men making well-intended, well-thought-out statements,'' he said. `` If you listen to the average British debate, you will notice an obvious antagonistic tone in the members' voices; if one side says one thing, a member of the other side will automatically jump to his feet to challenge the other member.'' <ORGANIZATION> C-SPAN </ORGANIZATION> covered Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s speech at the opening of British <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last year and now provides regular coverage of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. This year it also will cover the opening of the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Oct. 4-6 and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, Oct. 9-11. Lamb expects the foreign coverage to cost between $ 250,000 and $ 500,000 in a year's time _ a pittance in comparison with what the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television networks would spend.

 Anti-apartheid leaders said Sunday they were encouraged by a meeting between between President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, but a spokesman for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife was skeptical. `` At long last a head of state was heeding the calls of those who are interested in negotiations,'' Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> news conference. `` In some ways you could say it is the outgoing president meeting someone who is going to succeed him in <LOCATION> Tuynhuys </LOCATION>,'' he said, referring to the official residence where <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> talked with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> for 45 minutes Wednesday. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said there was `` more to be gained than to be lost'' in meeting with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who `` is after all still the state president. He still does call the shots.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is to step down after elections in September. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, imprisoned since 1962, is serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white-dominated government. He is regarded as the leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and many black South Africans want him to be their president. Other black leaders refuse to negotiate with the government until he is freed. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has not made any comment on the meeting. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Eglin </PERSON>, former leader of the now-defunct anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said the meeting appeared in part an attempt to get white South Africans used to the idea that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader will be released from prison soon. `` Mandela's public image is being changed from that of the enemy to someone who visits the president at his home,'' <PERSON> Eglin </PERSON> said in an interview. But at a news conference at <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home, the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, said the government `` is taking advantage of the position of Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, trying to give the impression to the world that they are negotiating with him when they are the only ones who have access to him. `` If a leader is put in a situation where he is not able to consult the people he represents, the people are not able to indicate they have any hope in what has happened,'' he said. <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> said his comments reflected the views of community leaders who met at Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s home, but he did not name any of them. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> let <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> speak for her, answering only one question, about whether she thought the meeting meant <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> would be freed soon. `` We have n't the slightest idea. It is impossible to analyze the present indications,'' she said. Leaders of major anti-apartheid groups ostracized Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in February because of what they called a `` reign of terror'' by her bodyguards in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the black township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Since then she has made few appearances. Zulu leader <PERSON> Mangosuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>, who is preparing for negotiations with exiled <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON> to end fighting between black political groups in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province, said `` all men of goodwill will applaud the meeting between these two sons of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' Zulu youths who oppose <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> and support <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> policies cheered when the <LOCATION> Botha-Mandela </LOCATION> meeting was mentioned during a <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> rally Sunday that drew 6,000 people. The rally was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, involved in the peace negotiations with <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON>'s Inkatha organization to stop violence that has taken some 2,000 lives in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> in the past three years.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who favors calling a special session of the state's legislature to enact new restrictions on abortions, said Sunday he expects `` very aggressive'' lobbying by both sides but hopes there will be no resort to violent tactics. `` I believe there is a compromise that can be reached between the rights of the unborn and the rights of women,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, himself an abortion opponent. The Republican governor, appearing on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>'' program said areas of possible compromise include permitting abortions in cases of rape, incest or where the mother's health is threatened Although he has not yet made a final decision, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he prefers calling a special session of the legislature in October. Also interviewed on the program was <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>'s Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON>, who criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision last week upholding a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> statute restricting abortions. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has really done is created a different standard in each state,'' she said. `` It's created turmoil where there was an uneasy truce. And it's wrenched open a very, very raw wound. The kind of emotional and antagonistic debate that has erupted is going to be very, very tough.'' Gov. <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> law's ban on using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions `` a dangerous restriction because so many women are dependent on public funds.'' `` And when you take away public funds,'' she said, `` you really take away their choice as to whether and when they want to have a child.''

<TEXT>
 Thousands of sunbathers were trapped on south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> beaches for hours Sunday as rival Shiite Moslem militiamen battled with machine guns, mortars and rocket-propelled grenades in nearby neighborhoods, police said. Syrian troops in charge of security in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem sector arranged a one-hour `` mercy cease-fire'' at sundown and evacuated the trapped beach goers, said a police spokesman. `` It was like a horror movie ... Flocks of people ran in every direction as grenades and gunfire burst in the air,'' said <PERSON> Massara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kahwaji </PERSON>, a homemaker who joined an evacuation convoy as she returned to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from a weekend in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Also Sunday, Syrian gunners in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> fired sporadic barrages at the Christian enclave's coast to prevent a ship suspected of carrying arms from docking. The Syrian guns opened up again in late afternoon, shelling the Christian residential districts of <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yarzi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hazmiyeh </PERSON> southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said two people were wounded. By police count, 403 people have been killed and 1,576 wounded since the March outbreak of the Christian-Syrian confrontation. Three people were killed and nine were wounded in the militia violence in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the police official who spoke on condition of anonymity. That brought the overall toll to 11 killed and 37 wounded in the current confrontation, which erupted nine days ago between the pro-Syrian mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia and the Iranian-backed, fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The militias are vying for power over <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1 million Shiite Moslems. The fighting blocked all escape routes from south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ouzai </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jnah </PERSON> districts and stranded thousands of people on the sand throughout the day. Syrian armored personnel carriers took many evacuees to coastal villages south of the capital, while others were escorted back to west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as sniper fire crackled overhead. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, Syrian and Christian troops traded sniper fire along <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION>, forcing a one-hour closure of the only open gateway between the Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors of the city. The hostilities were evidence that <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> trouble-shooter <PERSON> Lakhdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> had failed to make headway in his four days of talks with <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> and Moslem leaders in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Ibrahimi wound up two days of talks with the army leader, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, and other <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Saturday. On Sunday, he met with <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. One parliamentarian, requesting anonymity, said <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> was trying to arrange a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to draw up political reforms that would give Moslems an equal share of power with the Christians. The Christians have dominated the government, army, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and judiciary since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, when Christians were thought to be the majority. According to experts, Moslems are now the majority of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million people. They have been fighting in the 14-year-old civil war for political equality. Parliament has been unable to meet in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since September, when President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s term expired with no successor elected. The source said <PERSON> Ibrahimi </PERSON> contends that once political reforms are drafted, chances will improve for holding a <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> session in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to elect a new president, who would form a national coalition Cabinet to carry out the reforms. Minutes before stepping down, <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> named <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> like himself, prime minister of a military caretaker <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>. Moslems rejected <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s appointment and pledged allegiance to Syrian-backed, acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem who governed under <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>. The split splintered the army and police along sectarian lines and eventually led to the outbreak of the current Christian-Syrian confrontation.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> government is allowing increasing numbers of older Cubans to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the reason is clear _ money. The Cubans charge a fee of $ 700 and up for the privilege. `` In the last six months the number of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> citizens being allowed to visit relatives in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has jumped dramatically,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> quoted an unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> as saying. The number of B-2 tourist visas, issued by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests Section in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, that the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government has allowed to be used jumped from 230 a month in October to 1,823 a month in March to about 3,000 a month in June, the newspaper reported Sunday. At the present rate, by year's end about 30,000 Cubans will have entered or be eligible to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. No figures are kept on the number who seek asylum, said <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Convy </PERSON>, assistant <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> district director in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> approves most visa requests from Cubans, consular officials said. However, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government restricts the use of the visas to men over 65 and women over 60, and requires them to pay a fee of $ 700 to $ 1,000. Cuban exiles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> mail their relatives the money for the fee. `` All you have to do is multiply 3,000 by $ 700 try to determine how much the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government is keeping, and you'll see it's in the millions of dollars,'' an unidentified consular official told the newspaper. `` All those dollars are paid by the relatives in the states.'' The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Interests Section, which handles <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> affairs in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> because the nations lack full diplomatic relations, said the numbers will continue to grow if the Cuban government allows it. `` The <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government is very excited about this stepped-up B-2 program because it represents a lot of money for them, which they always need. They have even talked of lowering the age of those eligible to travel, from 60 to 50 years, and that would create more business,'' the newspaper quoted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official as saying. Told of the increase in tourist visas from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said: `` I guess we are being caught by surprise by this increase. Our people in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> have not informed us yet.'' Relatives of <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbonell </PERSON>, 70, who had not seen him for nearly 30 years, recently brought him to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` He wanted to come and we thought maybe this would be the last time we would see each other,'' said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Heria </PERSON>, 65, one of <PERSON> Carbonell </PERSON>'s cousins. Six relatives contributed $ 720 so <PERSON> Carbonell </PERSON> could pay the fee for a 20-day visit. An additional $ 225 would have extended his stay to 40 days. Each visitor is allowed to return to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> with 100 pounds of luggage. Only clothes and food items are allowed. Jewelry and electrical appliances, things that can be resold, are not permitted. Returning travelers must pay four Cuban dollars for each pound brought back. They must also declare any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollars they have; those dollars may be spent only at a tourist store on the island. `` I would normally not want to give money to <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s government,'' said <PERSON> Heria </PERSON>, an exile for 25 years `` But I wanted my cousin to taste <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> at least once in his life. So, I gave <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> a few dollars. It was a dilemma.''

 It took 1,900 tons of dirt and rock and 10 hours of labor into the night, but workers triumphed over a 20-foot sinkhole threatening to devour <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Priest </PERSON>'s house, although they did lose the front lawn `` It's good being back,'' Priest said Saturday. `` There's nothing like it.''

Borough engineer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>, who ordered the evacuation, thought any more rain might cause the hole to widen and possibly destroy the home.

Workers using several trucks Friday, worked almost non-stop hauling fill materials of dirt and rocks to the Priest home. The stuff had been excavated at a nearby highway construction site and was unneeded, officials said. Volunteers from nearby fire companies kept roads open for the trucks and provided lighting that allowed the filling to continue after dark. `` I never saw anyone work like those guys did,'' <PERSON> Priest </PERSON> said. `` When I read in the papers about people who were flooded out and lost everything, we were lucky,'' he said. `` We did n't lose anything but the front lawn.

<TEXT>
 As <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> closes out a seven-year, high-profile stint as the nation's surgeon general, officials in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are wrangling over whether they want his successor to enjoy the same visibility. Though he possessed very little statutory power, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> used the office as a bully pulpit to hammer at the hazards of smoking, raise the nation's awareness of AIDS and become, as he puts it, the `` health conscience'' of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Although technically his office is within the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> was an independent surgeon general _ at times a little too independent to suit some conservatives in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> White House. `` I'm not clear that office will ever again hold the stature it did under <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. It's not clear whether the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration wants it to. While the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is collecting names of possible nominees for the job, some in the administration want its profile lowered. According to sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity, thought has even been given to simply adding surgeon general to Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>'s title as assistant <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary for health, a move that is not without precedent. <PERSON> Chase </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, personnel director for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, declined to speak directly to the varied opinions circulating. But, he said, `` We're proceeding on the assumption that it will be separate from Dr. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>.'' About 15 names are on a list of people who have indicated they are interested in the job or have been recommended by others, <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> said, refusing to identify any of them. `` The names have been coming in on their own since it was made public -LRB- in early May -RRB- that <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> would be leaving,'' he said. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the president's personal physician, said he is `` pushing for a woman'' to get the job and has recommended the names of several he believes are qualified. He declined to identify any of them, but said none is a well-known public figure. `` It's turned out to be quite a political job,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said, and will probably become even more so with the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling last week giving states more authority to limit access to abortions. `` No matter who you get, they're going to be the subject of a lot of criticism,'' he said. One name that has surfaced is Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> `` Red'' <PERSON> Duke </PERSON>, a noted trauma surgeon at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and host of PBS' `` Bodywatch.'' Supporters of the 60-year-old `` cowboy'' doctor say he's got the same kind of charisma and communications skills that worked so successfully to make <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> an American folk hero. A name mentioned by conservative groups is Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redfield </PERSON>, chief of retroviral research at <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide who now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said conservative groups `` are only now beginning to focus on -LRB- the vacancy -RRB- and realize it's an important post.'' AIDS activists, who heap kudos on <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> for taking the lead on AIDS and speaking openly about condoms and sex education to prevent its spread, are also watching to see who his successor will be. They are heartened that <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> _ who served on the President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s AIDS commission _ has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s ear as the president's personal physician `` A strong person with moral persuasions on this issue could be a real problem,'' the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> McGuire </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> helped break down the moral impediments around AIDS ... My biggest fear would be someone who would build them up again.'' As for <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, the 72-year-old pediatrician will step down this week and begin writing his memoirs and looking for media opportunities to continue preaching his health messages. In a recent session with reporters, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said his activism and independence strengthened the office of surgeon general and give his successor `` a better opportunity of accomplishing things.'' Asked how he would advise his successor, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said recently: `` Do n't try to copy me or anybody else. ... Do what you can do and be who you are to the very best of your ability. That's exactly what I did.''

 Two Palestinians reportedly were fatally shot by troops on Sunday, and soldiers blew up the home of a Palestinian accused of killing 14 people by forcing their bus to crash. Police in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> dispersed a crowd of Israelis who chanted `` Death to Arabs!'' and stoned Arab cars in anger over the bus attack on Thursday, the deadliest event in the 19-month-old Palestinian uprising. Police on horseback charged the stone-throwing Israelis, mostly Orthodox Jews in black hats and long coats, when rioting erupted after the funeral of <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, 74, one of the bus victims. Police said 11 Israelis were arrested Sunday, bringing to 27 the number arrested since the violence over the bus attack broke out on Friday. Israeli officials criticized the three days of anti-Arab violence, which left one Palestinian dead and nine wounded. Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> broke a three-month silence and condemned the violence. `` It is self-evident that this despicable crime carried out against bus passengers ... caused deep pain in the hearts of every citizen of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the 75-year-old <PERSON> Begin </PERSON> said in a statement released by his spokesman <PERSON> Yehiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadishai </PERSON>. `` But the responses we have seen in the last few days will only sharpen hatred between the two nations and it must be prevented,'' he said. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said Sunday on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> television news: `` I'm sorry for the attacks. These are irresponsible acts that do not help anyone, bring chaos to our land, and do not hurt the Arabs in the end.'' Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said his center-left party would decide Monday whether to pull out of the coalition government led by <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc. Several Labor ministers have called for such a move, saying principles adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> last week could discourage Palestinians from agreeing to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s plan for elections in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. A Labor pullout could topple the government seven months after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s elections. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television reported Sunday that high-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were urging Labor not to leave the government. A high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> delegation plans to visit <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 10 days to discuss the future of the government's proposal for elections in the occupied lands. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> summoned <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> on Sunday to complain that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> failed to condemn the bus attack as terrorism, a ministry statement said. The statement said <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> also told <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> `` has long ago broken the conditions set by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government for continuing the -LRB- U.S.-PLO -RRB- dialogue'' in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> had no comment on the statement. On Sunday, a senior police official said that investigators believe the bus attacker acted on his own. Palestinian sources said he apparently was avenging the beating of a brother by soldiers last month and the arrest of other relatives during the uprising. Soldiers blew up the home of the suspect, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadi </PERSON> <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rassem </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Nusseirat refugee camp on Sunday. The government often destroys or seals homes to punish Palestinians suspected of violent attacks. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has condemned the practice as a violation of due process rights because most suspects have not faced trial when their homes are destroyed. <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON>, 23, was in the hospital ward of an unidentified prison Sunday recovering from head and chest injuries suffered when the bus plunged into a deep ravine. Police say <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> grabbed the steering wheel from the driver and forced it to crash, killing 14 people, including 10 Israelis and injuring 27. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Ramin </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 20-year-old <PERSON> Ayman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> was shot in the chest and killed when soldiers opened fire on masked Palestinians building a roadblock to stop troops from entering the village, Arab hospital officials said. In <LOCATION> Madana </LOCATION>, also near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fayez </PERSON> <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON>, 21, was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest when troops opened fire on a group of youths who stoned an <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> patrol </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. A military spokesman said the army had hospital reports of a death in <PERSON> Ramin </PERSON> but was still investigating the circumstances. He said he had no reports of the Madana incident. The deaths would bring to 552 the number of Palestinians killed in the uprising. Thirty-three Israelis have been killed. Seven other Palestinians were reported shot and wounded Sunday in clashes with the army. Under <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s election plan, Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> would choose representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-rule. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> maintains the principles voted by <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday do not affect the plan, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> criticized the party's action as `` not helpful'' to the peace process. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> said no elections would be held until the uprising ends and that a program of building Jewish settlements in the occupied territories will go forward.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s new military leader, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON>, Sunday announced formation of a Cabinet that will try to end the nation's six-year civil war and revive its faltering economy. The 21-member Cabinet, in which el-Bashir doubles as prime minister and minister of defense, was announced over state television by Brig. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sulaiman </PERSON>, a member of the ruling junta who acts as government spokesman. The country has a $ 13 billion foreign debt and spends $ 1 million daily fighting southern rebels led by turncoat army Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Garang </PERSON>. They want greater regional autonomy. The cabinet is to be sworn in on Monday. But Western diplomatic sources have said they do not expect the junta, a 15-man military council headed by <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON>, to yield decision-making power to the Cabinet. The junta was formed after el-Bashir ousted Prime Minister <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> in a coup on June 30. The Cabinet includes three members of the military council, four southerners and two former officials who worked under former President <PERSON> Gaafar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nimeiri </PERSON> but broke with him shortly before his ouster in 1985. <PERSON> El-Bashir </PERSON>'s deputy in the military council, Brig. <PERSON> El-Zobair </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON>, was appointed deputy premier. Two other junta members appointed were Brig. <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu-Saleh </PERSON>, as police minister, and Lt. Col. <PERSON> El-Tayeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON>, as minister of presidential affairs. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Aly </PERSON> <PERSON> Sahloul </PERSON>, Finance Minister <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaki </PERSON> and Minister for <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaker </ORGANIZATION> el-Serag served as underscretaries in their respective ministries before el-Bashir's coup The southern Cabinet appointees are <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Niyal </PERSON>, minister of guidance; <PERSON> Nataly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yelker </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambo </PERSON>, minister of local governments; <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Ador </PERSON>, minister of relief; and the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenga </PERSON>, minister of labor and social insurance.

 A former state police detective who investigated Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s 1969 accident at <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> is suing the author of a book on the incident, claiming the author never paid for his information. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, the police detective lieutenant, claims that author <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Damore </PERSON> promised him $ 50,000 for his cooperation when <PERSON> Damore </PERSON> was writing `` Senatorial Privilege,'' an account of the accident in which the senator's 28-year-old passenger, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>, was killed. `` This is a contract that is oral in nature,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickerson </PERSON>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` However, there are some written memorandums that reflect the existence of an oral contract.'' The fatal <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> accident, which also helped to kill <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s hopes of being president, occurred 20 years ago this month, on July 19, 1969. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> told <PERSON> Damore </PERSON> that he met secretly on at least two occasions with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, and lawyer, <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, to pass along information about the district attorney's probe into the accident <PERSON> Damore </PERSON> said he paid <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> $ 1,000 to cover expenses but said he never promised the investigator any money. `` I told him ` you ca n't be paid for this information,''' <PERSON> Damore </PERSON> said. `` ` You'll hurt yourself and you'll hurt the credibility of the information,' I said to him, ` as far as money is concerned, forget it.' There was no contract here, none.'' <PERSON> Damore </PERSON> has filed to dismiss the lawsuit, but said that if it goes to trial he might be forced to subpoena <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` That alone is worth $ 50,000,'' said the author. The book was published in 1988 by Regnery Gateway, a conservative publishing house based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, after it had been rejected by a number of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> publishers. <PERSON> Damore </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Saybrook </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is a former <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION> resident who has written several books, including a flattering account of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s years on the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION>. One of the <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> book's most controversial revelations was an allegation that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> wanted to tell police that <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> had been driving alone on the night of the crash. That account was based on interviews with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Gargan </PERSON>, who went with the senator and another friend, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Markham </PERSON>, to try and rescue <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> after the accident.

<HEAD>Moldavians Mass in Huge Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of ethnic Moldavians and opponents from non-native groups gathered Sunday in a tense demonstration, Soviet TV reported. `` Today in <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>, there was a flaming tinder but there was no explosion due to the balanced steps taken by law enforcement bodies,'' a correspondent reported from the Moldavian capital in the western <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. It did not say what steps authorities took to calm the situation. Members of groups demanding more rights for ethnic Moldavians carried tri-color nationalist flags and banners and shouted slogans such as `` <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> to Moldavians'' and `` Get out, Occupiers,'' the correspondent said on the evening news program `` Vremya.'' One huge red banner visible amid the thousands of people on <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION>'s main square read, `` We are n't Guests, we are Home!'' That appeared to be a slogan of non-ethnic Moldavians who are members of a largely Russian group, Interfront, and feel threatened by the nationalists' demands. Soviet TV said <LOCATION> Kishinev </LOCATION> officials had authorized Sunday's rally but wanted it to be a forum for dialogue between opposing groups. Instead, the demonstrators heckled a Moldavian representative to the national parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, according to the television report. Ethnic Moldavians have been agitating for months with strikes and demonstrations to have their native language restored to its original form. They also have complained about crime and environmental problems. <LOCATION> Moldavia </LOCATION> has long retained close ties with <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, its neighbor to the west, despite repeated attempts by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to link it more closely with <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. The region of 4.2 million people has passed from <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> to Romanian and back to Soviet control over the past century. Moldavian and Romanian are the same spoken language, but the late dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> imposed the Cyrillic alphabet on the Moldavians after Soviet troops occupied the region during World War II. Moldavian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Semyon </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossu </PERSON> in February condemned nationalist activists for going too far but endorsed some of the language demands. Draft legislation that would gradually reinstate the Latin script still used in neighboring <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> has been published for public discussion.

<HEAD>Tanker That Spilled Oil into Delaware River Leaves for Repairs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARCUS HOOK, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Uruguayan supertanker that spilled more than 300,000 gallons of oil into the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> last month left Sunday for repairs in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indies </LOCATION>. The cleanup of the June 24 spill is about 80 percent complete, `` but we'll be at it for several more weeks,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON>. The tanker <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> left this oil refinery city just southwest of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and steamed down the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, reaching the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> shortly after noon, <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said. The 749-foot-long ship's destination is <LOCATION> Curacao </LOCATION>, a West Indian island about 170 nautical miles northwest of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said. A Coast Guard tug, patrol boat and helicopter escorted the vessel 12 miles down the river from <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hook </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Memorial Bridge to watch for leaks, the spokesman said. No contamination was spotted. Two commercial tugboats and a skimmer vessel used to clean up the spill also accompanied the tanker to the bridge. The helicopter remained over the <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> until it reached the mouth of the bay, and made periodic overflights after, <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said. A <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> representative was aboard the ship until it reached <LOCATION> Lewes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, at the mouth. The tanker had been scheduled to leave Saturday, but was delayed because an overboard discharge monitor had to be replaced, <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said. The monitor measures the amount of oil lost when a ship pumps out water taken on as ballast. The ship passed a final inspection by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> before leaving. The tanker's bottom has been temporarily patched and oil has been cleaned off its hull, <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said. The tanker ran aground June 24 off <LOCATION> Claymont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, near the <LOCATION> Delaware-Pennsylvania </LOCATION> line, ripping open its bottom and spilling 300,000 gallons of thick, tarry industrial heating oil. The cleanup of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> has recovered about 400,000 gallons of oil and debris, <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Presidente </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> is expected to reach <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, in five days, and is scheduled to go into drydock in <LOCATION> Curacao </LOCATION> on July 26, he said. The investigation into the accident is continuing, and it may be several months before a cause is determined, <PERSON> Weakley </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, on a delicate and historic mission to accelerate renaissance in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, told the Polish people Sunday the world is inspired by their struggle but cautioned it `` will require further sacrifices.'' `` History _ which has so often conspired with geography to deny the Polish people their freedom _ now offers up a new and brighter future for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said upon his late-night arrival in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> after a nine-hour flight from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate on his prediction of sacrifice ahead for the Polish people, but administration officials have made clear any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid will be tied to economic austerity measures by the Poles themselves. The Poles declined to approve a severe economic austerity program two years ago that would have raised food prices and put other pressures on their already lean economic existence. Officials said at the time the program would send prices for such consumer services as rent and heating up as much as 200 percent and that the price for basic food items such as milk, bread and meat might double. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was greeted by Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> as he came down the ramp of his airplane. Also present was <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON>, deputy speaker of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and an adviser to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> It was the first time a Solidarity representative has been included at an official Polish state welcome. After inspecting a military honor guard and shaking hands with dignitaries invited to the airport ceremony, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> strode to a speaker's platform for their brief remarks. Before leaving his own capital, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had made clear he is sensitive to the two <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations' need to transform themselves without antagonizing the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which borders both. `` It is not our role to dictate to them what they should be doing or the refinements of the system,'' he said at a departure ceremony. In <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` winds of change surely have touched the land here where so much has happened since my last visit'' two years ago as vice president. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has started a long and ascending path of democratic change,'' he said. `` This climb is accelerating but will not always be easy and will require further sacrifices. But if followed, it will lead to a renaissance for this remarkable nation. `` These are great days for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued. `` Solidarity is again legal. The beginnings of a free press now exist. A new parliament is in place. The Polish senate has been restored through free and fair elections. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is making its own history. And <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the world, is watching. `` The world is inspired by what is happening here,'' he said. `` Here in the heart of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people have a fervent wish. ... That <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> be whole and free.'' Tactfully, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promoted <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, the country's communist leader, who was at the airport when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president's plane touched down. `` The government of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and you, Mr. Chairman, have shown vision and courage in taking the path of the round-table accords,'' the president said. He made no mention of <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s role in trying to break Solidarity and in imposing martial law in December 1981. The Polish leader greeted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as an `` outstanding politician and statesman, the leader of the great <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people with which the Poles are linked by lively ties of friendship based on long tradition.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said, `` <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> residents who have come in such great numbers to see you and greet you this summer evening are giving an expression of this.'' Despite the late hour, thousands of people scattered in groups along <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 4.5 mile motorcade route cheered and waved as he rode past. Some of them waved huge <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pulled out of the airport, a large crowd waved and many people shouted `` Solidarity.'' In his departure statement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were `` on the threshold of a new era'' and that <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` a continent cruelly divided for more than four decades, now dreams of being whole and free.'' In a conciliatory gesture toward <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that signalled his determination to end the Cold War era, the president said his task was `` to see that we mend old divisions, that we fulfill the decades-old dream, and that the new <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> emerges _ secure, prosperous, peaceful and free.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 10-day trip also will take him to a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and include a side trip to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> _ the first official visit by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s oldest diplomatic partner. But the emphasis will be on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visits to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the two Soviet bloc countries with the most pronounced trend toward a Western-style economy and a democratic political system. The symbolism of it all is immense: No <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president has visited a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation since <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> in 1977 and never has a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president been to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s goal is to wean <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s orbit and toward a more independent foreign policy. But the president is being careful not to couch his mission in competitive terms _ nor to exhort Poles and Hungarians into reckless actions that could backfire. In a television interview aired as the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> party was flying across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s offer of economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will be a `` measured response.'' `` The one thing that might create ... a wedge rather than a continued movement of reciprocal progress would be to put such a large package in there that the Poles would perceive that we are trying to replace the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s support with support from the West,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' `` That's not our intention,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` We are not trying to replace. What we are trying to do is augment.'' As for challenging Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who barnstormed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last month and has just completed a visit to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disavowed any intention of being provocative. `` I think if we went there with hot rhetoric and our goal was to complicate things for Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, yes, there would be a danger,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said just before Air Force One took off from <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> and headed toward a sun just climbing above the eastern horizon. `` But I think I know enough about it ... and others upon who I'm relying know enough about it ... and know that's not going to happen,'' he told reporters At the same time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed: `` I'm not going to back off my principles because it might offend Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. I'm not going to try to put him in a box by throwing strains on the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. I will give my aspirations for a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> whole and free. What we want to do is encourage them.'' <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Newsmaker Sunday'' program, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit was taking place `` at a very important moment'' in history and `` that is why I see President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s visit as an element that would favor the positive processes which are already taking place and which are bringing East and West closer together.'' Recalling the talks that were held when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> as vice president two years ago, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said he recognized then that `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s matters are very close to him -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- and understood by him.''

<TEXT>
 A major government arms warehouse exploded and burst into flames near the city's airport Sunday destroying a large quantity of ammunition and weaponry, witnesses said. The explosion in eastern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> occurred close to midnight Sunday and shook buildings up to five miles away. It was not immediately known what caused the blast but the city has been the target of rocket attacks by Moslem guerrillas in the past week. The fire burned for more than two hours throwing glowing shrapnel into the night sky. It grew into a towering column of smoke. The extent of damage, and the type and quantity of weaponry destroyed, was not immediately known. Reporters were unable to visit the spot because of a 10 p.m.-to-4 a.m. curfew imposed by the government. Foreign Ministry Spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said Sunday that as many as 50 rockets hit the capital during the week, killing at least 15 people. The insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet forces intervened in December 1979 to back the government. Their withdrawal was mandated under a U.S.-mediated accord, and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> completed the pullout on Feb. 15. The guerrillas attacked <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s fifth-largest city, on March 6 in their first major assault after the Soviet withdrawal. The city would provide the insurgents with a seat for the government they formed in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where they have their headquarters. On Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said government troops were in complete control of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION> and surrounding hills, giving them a strategic advantage over the rebels. He also said government forces backed by a tank regiment had destroyed guerrilla bases and killed 81 insurgents as they advanced two miles to come within 32 miles of the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border. The government reports could not be independently confirmed.

 Lightning-bolt hair, microwave tie-dying and palm trees that dance to music were among the brave new possibilities offered at a national trade show Sunday. Thousands of gadgets and appliances from more than 600 producers were on display at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housewares </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> show. The three-day show, which ends Tuesday, brings producers and buyers together and allows for a midyear assessment of the housewares industry as the Christmas buying season approaches. `` Personal care is a billion-dollar business, kitchen electric is multibillion,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, vice president for marketing of <ORGANIZATION> Conair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. Both are among the multitude of products considered housewares. One trend appears to be putting patterns in hair, and the appliance industry is trying to stay one jump ahead of demand. Enter Impressions, a waffle iron-like device made by <ORGANIZATION> Conair </ORGANIZATION> that embosses designs like jagged lightning bolts in hair. Its suggested retail price is $ 29.95. Want to tie-dye a T-shirt, but short of time? There's Micro-Dye, a $ 3.49 kit by <ORGANIZATION> Dylon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Youngsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that allows one to tie-dye in a microwave oven in four minutes. `` It's a 60s to the 90s look,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Krueger </PERSON> of <PERSON> Dylon </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Zojirushi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bakery </ORGANIZATION> is `` the next stop'' in automatic bread-making machines, said show spokeswoman <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleishman </PERSON>. In addition to fresh bread, the $ 325 appliance makes jam, cake and frosting. `` It's very much for the sophisticated cook,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Fleishman </PERSON>. For sore muscles or tired feet, there's the personal massager, another item on the move. Massagers were a $ 30 million industry last year, and producers are expected to double that by the end of 1989. `` Massagers have been more popular in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and it's time the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> woke up,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which sells under the brand name of <LOCATION> Pollenex </LOCATION> `` We've come out with 16 new products this year,'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> said, `` and the twist massager is going to be a tremendous product.'' The 42-inch rope-type device goes for a suggested price of $ 29.95. For those who want to cool their throats, there's SodaMaster, put out by <ORGANIZATION> SodaMaster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Decatur </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` Add the fun of fizz to any drink,'' the company says. SodaMaster sells for $ 150, and adds carbonation to juices, water, wine or any cold drink. For that one more item to make life complete, there's the Dancing Palmtree by <ORGANIZATION> Gemmy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which goes for $ 15 wholesale. The artificial palm tree about a foot tall sports sunglasses and sways back and forth when exposed to music, almost like it's dancing.

 The investigation of the deaths of four children seemed to have hit a dead end seven years ago, until a newspaper reporter's questions led an officer to read through the file and reopen the case. Now <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 34, who originally blamed her children's deaths on bad luck, has been accused of killing them in separate incidents from 1977 to 1982 Formal charges were filed last week in three of the deaths, and police say she has confessed to the fourth death. Police say Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> smothered the children, at least twice after fights with her then-husband, but at the time of the deaths they did not have solid evidence to back their suspicions and bring charges. Authorities have said the case originally fell through the cracks when officials failed to communicate with one another. Police, social and medical agencies in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> counties were involved. `` The ` cracks' did result in part from the number of agencies and crossing jurisdictional lines,'' <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> District Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. `` But you've got to acknowledge also there were flaws in what was done.'' A few hours before her arrest last Monday, police say, Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> confessed to investigators from neighboring <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to killing 2-year-old <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> in 1977 and 11-year-old <PERSON> Jennyann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in 1982. She was indicted Thursday in <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> on charges of murdering <PERSON> Jennyann </PERSON>, and also 3-month-old <PERSON> Tibitha </PERSON> <PERSON> Janeel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> in 1980 and 3-year-old <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON> in 1981. <PERSON> James </PERSON> died in <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and that case will be handled there, said <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Slaton </PERSON>. The case was placed on `` no lead'' status in 1982, leaving it dormant, because there `` just was n't enough to go with,'' said <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Maj. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The deaths of <LOCATION> Tibitha </LOCATION> and <PERSON> James </PERSON>, for example, were originally attributed by medical examiners to sudden infant death syndrome. The investigation was reopened in December after an inquiry about the case by a reporter from The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Journal-Constitution who was doing a story on how government agencies handle deaths of juveniles, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. County police Director <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Clackum </PERSON> reviewed the case file and decided to reopen the investigation, he said. `` What we did when we reopened the case, we went back to square one,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. He would not comment on specific evidence, but said the new investigation included interviews with people who were not included in the first investigation. `` We wanted to make sure everything was in line before we interviewed Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. Since the time of the last death, she had remarried and moved to <LOCATION> Locust </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION>, a town of about 2,000 some 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and her new husband do not have children of their own. <PERSON> Jennyann </PERSON> reportedly asked for help from her natural father and a social worker, but was returned to her mother after being placed for a time with another relative. She was found Feb. 21, 1982, face down on her mother's bed, dead from what medical examiners at the time called `` unexplained asphyxia.'' `` You'd have to say the system failed in this,'' <PERSON> Keller </PERSON> said. Police have refused to say how Mrs. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> allegedly killed the children, though the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> newspaper reported that in at least two cases she is suspected of having smothered them with her body. `` It seems that every time that she would get into an argument with her husband and he would leave, something would happen to one of the children,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. During the first investigation, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said, there were `` real strong feelings'' that a crime had been committed. And pathologists' reports at the time made note of the previous deaths, he said But he noted that to arrest someone, there must be probable cause that a crime was committed. After the children died, he said, police `` went to the prosecutors that were handling this case and presented what they had to them. It was just a general feeling that there just was n't enough to go with.''

<HEAD>Allegations of Fraud Cloud Results of July 2 Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Election officials Sunday began releasing results of last week's elections in five states, and the returns favored the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The opposition accused the party of vote fraud. In the border city of <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or PAN, alleged massive irregularities and pulled out of the vote count. The ruling party, known as the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, had proclaimed victory all week in the overwhelming majority of state and local races held on July 2. The exception was <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> gave up a governor's seat for the first time in its 60-year history. Despite that defeat and PAN's allegations of fraud, the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> had repeatedly insisted it had maintained control of the state assembly and <ORGANIZATION> Baja </ORGANIZATION>'s city halls. In the northern state of <LOCATION> Chihuahua </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> had won all 67 city hall races, including the one in <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juarez </LOCATION>, and 17 of the 18 state assembly races. On the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Campeche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> announced a <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> sweep of the state assemby races. The election commission in the northern state of <LOCATION> Zacatecas </LOCATION> did the same. Elsewhere, the official count continued and results in some areas were not expected for days. In the central state of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, contested campaigns by the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and its archrival, the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, were followed by competing claims of victory and charges of fraud and voter intimidation. `` We wo n't give up a single vote,'' the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> chairman in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Fausto </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallejo </PERSON>, said Sunday as the state election commission continued to tally the vote. The <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> elections were seen as a key contest between the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> and its leftist opposition. The official counts that began Sunday involve adding up the tally sheets made by poll officials, who counted the ballots on election day. In the two most hotly contested states, <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION>, opposition parties had representatives watching the actual ballot count at most polling places. The parties say their victory claims are based on the tallies reported by their poll watchers and election workers. <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>'s historic concession in the <LOCATION> Baja </LOCATION> governor's race dominated the news here and abroad, drawing praise for President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> and his move toward democratic reform. It also overshadowed other races and the opposition charges of fraud. In 60 years of unbroken <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> rule that stretched from local election commissions to the tiniest city halls to the presidency, vote fraud had become so common that a whole vocabulary of slang arose to describe ways to rig elections.

 President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arrival at <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Military Airport on a sweltering summer night included a goose-stepping military honor guard, a Solidarity representative and a bit of Polish speaking by the president. `` Czolem,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shouted in a firm voice to the high-booted troops who formed the honor guard. The traditional military greeting usually is translated as `` hail.'' `` Hail, Mr. President,'' the troops shouted back in Polish. The nation was able to watch <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s long-anticipated arrival live on television, from the time Air Force One taxied onto the runway at 10:01 p.m. until his motorcade left for a government guest house on the edge of a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> park. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is in the midst of a rare summer heat wave, with temperatures in the 90s. Through the open windows in city streets, the broadcast of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arriving could be heard coming from almost every apartment. Polish Communist leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, looking excited, greeted the smiling president as he came down the steps of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jet, accompanied by his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>. Also present were young boy and girl scouts, who presented <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a bouquet of red and white roses, the colors that make up the Polish flag. `` This kid speaks beautiful English,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could be heard saying about one child. In a sign of the historic changes that have take place in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in recent weeks, one of the first dignitaries in the line to greet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON>, deputy speaker of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and a senior adviser to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. It was the first time a Solidarity representative has been on hand for an official state welcome ceremony. As he waited, <PERSON> Wielowieyski </PERSON> mingled easily with members of the government. In his brief welcoming remarks, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, wearing a civilian suit, told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` You are coming to a land in which a process of fundamental changes is underway.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` There is a great deal of work to be done. And we will work together to gain new ground, to expand our common ground ... Long live <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' Then the army and air force troops, carrying sabres and rifles with shiny bayonets, goose-stepped away as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> looked on. Crowds lined the road leading from the airport to watch <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speeding motorcade pass `` He's a terrific guy. We're very happy he came, but he went by too fast,'' joked a middle-age female office worker after the column of dozens of cars sped past. `` For <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, this is a very important thing, a visit from the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said a professor watching near his home in the city's <LOCATION> Ochota </LOCATION> district. `` The emotional support is the most important thing ... We also hope there will be some monetary deal'' from the visit. The professor's neighbor, an English teacher, said, `` Everyone expects ... Some arrangements to help us out of this economic crisis.'' She added that as an educator, she looks forward to more student exchanges with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision giving states new authority to restrict abortions means a new round of fights in the states about the contentious issue, two women on opposite sides of the dispute agreed Sunday. `` It's the voters who are going to hold the candidates to a new level of accountability and they're going to lose their jobs,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, associate legislative director for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed. `` We've proven that the pro-life margin is enough to help elect pro-life representatives.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> disputed that, saying, `` no, no, no, no, no.'' The debate occurred on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' The disagreement by the women mirrored comments a week ago in the wake of the 5-4 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision which said the states could have new authority to restrict abortion. Representatives of both sides said the fight would now turn to state legislatures. Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said, `` we're going to do what we've been doing for the past 16 years -LRB- since the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision legalizing abortions -RRB-. `` We have a very strong grassroots organization in place, which has been very active in helping to pass protective legislation, the kind of legislation that's finally been upheld by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after years of striking down even minimal restrictions.'' `` There are a lot of people out there who for many years now have felt that they have been unable to do anything about this issue,'' she said. `` What the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> did was to return aspects of this issue back to the democratic processes and the people.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON> said, `` you know the lives and health of women should not depend on the accident of their residency any more than the right of the freedom of the press should depend on where a newspaper is published.'' `` We may have lost faith in five justices of the court, but we have not lost faith in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public,'' she said. She said one target will be <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who said he is willing to call the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> legislature into special session to write new restrictions on abortion. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he expects intensive lobbying from both sides. `` I suspect that it will be very aggressive, no question about it, from both sides,'' he said. `` I would hope that we each enjoy the freedom of speech, but do it without harm to anyone, without damaging public or private property, that we communicate our thoughts and be as aggressive as you like. I know it's an aggressive kind of issue.'' Gov. <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> said `` I hope we can develop another way that we do n't have to just respond emotionally, that we can realize the world has changed, and women have become used to the idea that our present day other choices of freedom include the idea of choosing when, whether they want to have children.''

 Three former government housing officials reaped millions in `` unjustified profits'' and increased costs in two troubled housing programs through a mortgage company suspended from government work because of questionable business practices, a federal audit says. The three _ including <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, now ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> _ are among those who capitalized on their knowledge of the housing programs and the lender's lax enforcement of government regulations. They formed a joint development venture after working briefly at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. That venture was called <ORGANIZATION> Winn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which according to another <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit, was the development company involved in one of the projects. The mortgage on the project was insured by a company known as <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortage </ORGANIZATION>. The audit by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general detailed how the trio used `` paper'' corporations to increase their profits, and how <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> Mortgage used improper calculations to inflate mortgages and rent subsidies paid by the government. The audit does not accuse the three former officials of criminal wrongdoing, but recommends internal administrative sanctions against <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION>. A company spokesman said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s loan portfolio is sound, that it has not defaulted on any <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> coinsured loans and that the company has already filed a 2,500-page response to the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> audit. The inspector general audited 14 projects in the agency's moderate rehabilitation program financed and coinsured by <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION>, located in <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, and found that in none of the cases did the lender follow <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rules or `` prudent underwriting practices. Three of those projects were developed by companies partly owned by <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, who served one year as an assistant <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary and federal housing commissioner before being appointed ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Two other former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Queenan </PERSON>, were partners with <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> in one of the projects, the 160-apartment <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pointe </ORGANIZATION> complex in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev </LOCATION>. The report, which did not name the owners of the development companies, said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> `` manipulated rents and appraised values'' to get the highest allowable mortgage for the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pointe </LOCATION> project. According to the report, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> overestimated <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pointe </ORGANIZATION>'s anticipated rents and the property's value by including the government assistance and overstating the sales prices of two comparable properties That resulted in a Benton-approved, coinsured mortgage for <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pointe </ORGANIZATION> that the audit said was $ 2.5 million more than it should have been. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee headed by Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., is investigating a number of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> activities, including whether the moderate rehabilitation program has been used in some projects to jack up the mortgage value The moderate rehabilitation and mortgage coinsurance programs are among four that recently have been suspended, revised or restricted by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> after inspector general's reports revealed evidence of widespread abuse and mismanagement during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Our portfolio is sound,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, adding the company has not defaulted on any of its <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> coinsured loans. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> faces about $ 650 million in coinsured loan defaults from several mortgage companies whose practices now are under review. `` We specialize in low-income housing and the people we financed just happened to be those guys,'' <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> said the company already had made `` a 2,500-page, four-volume'' response to the IG's audit, which he would not discuss further. Another <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> group project was singled out as an example of <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s aiding in the `` pyramiding of profits'' by contractors and subcontractors through `` contrived identities of interests and paper conduit companies.'' In that instance, <ORGANIZATION> Sundance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, a company <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> listed as part of his holdings on a 1988 financial disclosure form, owned 25 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartments </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arapahoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo </LOCATION><LOCATION> . </LOCATION> The form also showed the company was formed and then sold in 1987 after the project was completed. <ORGANIZATION> Sundance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> selected <ORGANIZATION> Mead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as the contractor to rehabilitate <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> then formed M.A. <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as a construction company with common ownership. Sundance Housing and M.A. Builders then formed <ORGANIZATION> Sundance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Sundance Builders then became the general contractor and <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> a subcontractor Property owners and developers with common interests are eligible for certain profit and risk allowances in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s coinsurance program. However, the agency does n't allow for the added profit or overhead costs when a subcontractor appears to be a `` paper'' corporation, a company with no demonstrated ability in the field or no significant business outside its sphere of interest. Investigators determined that all three prohibitive conditions existed on the <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vista </LOCATION> project and four others and concluded that `` unjustified profits totaled $ 1,442,296 for the five projects.'' A 202-unit project at the Windsong apartments in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, another <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> group project, also was among the five cited for the `` paper'' corporations scheme in the audit. `` The arrangements should not have been approved,'' the auditors concluded. Other names and projects connected with alleged influence-peddling and favoritism in the moderate rehabilitation program show up in <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>'s portfolio of questionable coinsured loans cited by the inspector general. They include the 316-unit <LOCATION> Pebble </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> Apartments project developed by <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and the Four Seasons Apartments in <LOCATION> Gastonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, former executive assistant to then-HUD Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, a developer who paid former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> $ 300,000 as a consultant on one project, were paid $ 123,000 as consultants on the Four Seasons project. The Siegel-Watt project at the Kingsley Park Apartments in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, Md. was also among those that used `` paper'' corporations to build in excessive profits and overhead, to the tune of $ 336,373. The inspector general found actions by the <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION> lender `` resulted in material misrepresentation of mortgage amounts and rents'' that will force the government to overpay rent subsidies estimated at $ 37 million for the 15-year life of the housing assistance contracts. In addition, mortgages to moderate rehabilitation projects coinsured by <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> and the government were excessive by $ 22 million, the report said. The inspector general recommended <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> `` take appropriate sanctions'' against <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>. The company has been barred from making additional loans under the coinsurance program until Nov. 1 and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the review board is expected to take up the <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> case in mid-July. Although Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> had said last week <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> was under grand jury investigation, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Neri </PERSON>, assistant inspector general for investigations, said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has shared its audit information with the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> which would decide whether there is evidence of any criminal wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Down Despite Summer Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gasoline prices continued an uncharacteristic summer decline caused by increased oil and gasoline supplies, an analyst said Sunday. The nation's average retail price for a gallon of gasoline was $ 1.16.76 on July 7, a decrease of 1.67 cents since early June, said <PERSON> Trilby </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>, publisher of the biweekly <ORGANIZATION> Lundberg </ORGANIZATION> Survey of 12,000 gas stations. The price has dropped because refiners, terminal operators and importers had increased supplies to meet new federal clean-air regulations, <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. `` The drop reflects efforts on the part of the oil industry to step up their gasoline production and imports of gasoline during May and June in order to avoid any supply tightness or shortage,'' <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said that higher demand by summer drivers and policy changes in other oil producing nations could still push prices higher later this year. Gasoline reached its peak average price of $ 1.18.43 per gallon on May 19, a sharp rise at the time from the average price of 98.04 cents in early January, the survey found. At the self-service pump July 7, regular unleaded gasoline cost an average of $ 1.06.78 per gallon, while premium cost $ 1.22.52 per gallon and regular leaded was $ 1.06.12 per gallon. For full-service gasoline, the average cost for unleaded was $ 1.32.11 per gallon, premium cost $ 1.44.03 per gallon and regular leaded was $ 1.30.5 per gallon.

 A 3-year-old boy who disappeared last week emerged from dense woods with three dogs Sunday, walked up to search crews and asked for a cookie. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON> was hungry and had wet feet but was otherwise fine, authorities said. He had gone into the foothills of the <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> on Friday on an imaginary fishing trip with a neighbor's dogs, two adult Australian shepherd dogs and a small white puppy. `` I knew that if any 3-year-old could survive, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> could do it,'' said his his tearful mother, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON>, 38. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> probably survived by sleeping with the dogs, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, an emergency room physician at the hospital. The boy, dressed in a short-sleve shirt, pants and high-top sneakers, left his house about 1 p.m. Friday. He carried a 3-foot length of plastic pipe to use as a pretend fishing pole. He was reported missing after he failed to return from <LOCATION> Fall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, just 200 feet away from the family home. The boy's father, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON>, said he did n't lose hope that his son would be found safe because the two had spent a lot of time together in the woods. He said he had a lot of confidence in the dogs, which belonged to <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a family friend with whom the Lefflers had been staying for about six weeks. `` <PERSON> Virgil </PERSON> told us, ` Do n't worry, my dogs will sleep with him and keep him warm,'' said <PERSON> Leffler </PERSON>. The boy later said he'd slept with the dogs both nights and that they'd helped him find his way out of the woods. Lt. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Clackamas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's office estimated 300 people were involved in the search Sunday morning. The effort included several teams of tracking dogs and a helicopter from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> 304th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The boy came into view about a three-fourths of a mile from where he disappeared. The dogs were trotting alongside. A helicopter took <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where doctors said he would stay overnight for observation. The youngster gave a `` thumbs up'' sign to onlookers at the hospital.

<TEXT>
 A dolphin that spent more than a week in city waters, resisting efforts to herd it back to sea, was found dead Sunday in the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nearly 50 miles north of here. The bottlenose dolphin was found floating off the town of <LOCATION> Garrison </LOCATION> on the east side of the river, said marine biologist <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadove </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Okeanos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, which rescues stranded sea mammals. The sea mammal was alive Saturday, <PERSON> Sadove </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. An autopsy was to be performed on the gray, 5-foot-long animal at an Okeanos laboratory in <LOCATION> Hampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> on </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the organization is based. <PERSON> Sadove </PERSON> declined to speculate on what caused the animal's death, but said it was not unexpected. He said last week that its condition had noticeably deteriorated. The dolphin's skin was peeling due to the lack of salt in the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>. The dolphin, of the same species as the dolphin that appeared in the television show `` Flipper,'' was first spotted June 20 in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. It stayed in the river for 11 days, attracting a steady stream of curious onlookers. The dolphin resisted efforts by biologists who tried to herd it back into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> by banging on pipes in the water. Two weeks ago, it headed north up the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION>. Scientists had planned to capture the dolphin Tuesday and take it to the sea.

<TEXT>
 The widely publicized all-star revival of `` Twelfth Night'' by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Shakespeare Festival is bawdy, boisterous, even boorish _ an idiosyncratic, often low comedy jokefest that sacrifices love, not to mention <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>, for laughs. The reason? There are a lot of stars on stage at the Delacorte Theater in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where `` Twelfth Night'' opened Sunday, and director <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Guskin </PERSON> has encouraged them to revel in their own eccentricities, no matter what it does to the play. Because of that directive, the production belongs to the strongest performers, in this case, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, a consummate song and dance man. <PERSON> Hines </PERSON>, dressed to look like a mummer in a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> New Year's Day parade, plays Feste, the fool. Feste dominates the evening, even making the quartet of lovers _ <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> and <PERSON> Orsino </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Olivia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> _ seem like supporting characters. Out the window goes much of the play's ideas about romance, particularly concerning sexual identity and illusion as well as its more thoughtful moments about death and reconciliation. <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, dressed as a boy, still pines for <PERSON> Orsino </PERSON> who longs for <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON> who sighs for the young man <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> pretends to be. And <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>'s long-lost twin brother <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> still arrives to straighten out the mess But they all seem secondary to the comic business at hand. Most of that business, fortunately, concerns <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> who has the grace, style and personality to get away with just about anything, even dropping his pants or dancing with surprised female members of the audience. He's helped in the comic antics by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON>, a gruff, inarticulate Sir <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> Belch </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> as the effete Sir <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguecheek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> displays a goofy charm accentuated by a straw-blond wig that makes him look like a dissipated Breck shampoo girl. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldblum </PERSON> gives the production's strangest performance. Playing <PERSON> Malvolio </PERSON>, <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>'s villainous steward and would-be suitor, <PERSON> Goldblum </PERSON> scampers around the large stage as if he were auditioning to replace <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> as the cockroach in `` Metamorphosis.'' His speaking voice is even stranger. Oozing insincerity, he affects a sing-song, stop-and-go cadence that obliterates any sense of <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s language. <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfeiffer </PERSON>, a wan, indifferent <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>, also tramples many of her speeches, rushing through them before she finds herself out of breath. There is more life _ and feel for the language _ to be found in <PERSON> Charlaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodard </PERSON> as <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>'s sprightly maid <PERSON> Maria </PERSON>. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> as a stuffy, even sexist <PERSON> Orsino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Winton </PERSON> as <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON> are adequate but bland. The best member of the quartet of lovers is <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Mastrantonio </PERSON>. She conveys <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>'s sense of sexual confusion and desperation in great comic style, but the actress does n't neglect the music to be found in <PERSON> Shakespeare </PERSON>'s moonstruck poetry Director <PERSON> Guskin </PERSON> has set the play at the turn of the century in a <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> country, not unlike <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION>. It allows costume designer <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Button </PERSON> to provide some elaborate costumes. And set designer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> has conjured up a peach-colored marble gazebo that dominates one side of the stage, with a tiny replica of <PERSON> Olivia </PERSON>'s house perched on a rocky cliff on the other side of the playing area `` Twelfth Night'' ends with a wistful song by <PERSON> Feste </PERSON>, delivered by <PERSON> Hines </PERSON> with great feeling. It releases a wide range of emotions that are missing from the mostly one-note, relentless buffoonery that precedes it.

 A lightning-sparked fire raged out of control Sunday along a 20-mile front in northwestern <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, threatening the community of <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> and forcing evacuation of a hospital, a nursing home and a park. Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> issued an emergency declaration for the area, making state money available, and ordered about 30 National Guardsmen to help an estimated 150 firefighters battle the blaze. The blaze also threatened the site of a former <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> cavalry post where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed. The fire burned to within 1 -LCB- miles of the city of 1,300 and authorities feared a shift in the wind could endanger the town. The fire started Saturday on the west side of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> and Park Superintendent <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotherham </PERSON> estimated that 10,000 to 12,000 acres trees, scrub and grassland in the 22,000-acre park's rugged canyons had burned It also had charred part of an adjoining wildlife refuge and private land. `` It looks really bad. A lot of those trees are 150 years old. ... It will take 100 years to rebuild it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rotherham </ORGANIZATION> said. The blaze grew to about 20 miles long and six miles wide, had burned 50,000 to 100,000 acres and was far from contained, said deputy state fire marshal <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>. `` We could see whole lines of trees exploding,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, a state game and parks commissioner who flew over the fire. A mushroom cloud of smoke could be seen from <LOCATION> Scottsbluff </LOCATION> about 90 miles away. `` It's not a pretty sight,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who flew along the perimeter of the blaze. `` There's so much, only so much that can be done, and they're doing everything humanly possible,'' In addition to a rugged landscape of buttes as high as 4,900 feet and long, narrow canyons, temperatures around 90 degrees and variable wind complicated firefighting efforts, officials said. `` Everything was against us,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rotherham </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It's been extremely hot. When it hit, it just kind of exploded things. This area is extremely rough _ they could n't get to it.'' About 150 firefighters from about 25 to 30 departments from <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> were fighting the blaze, he said. About midday, the fire inside the park was within one-half mile of historic <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the former cavalry post where Crazy Horse was killed by guards in 1877, <ORGANIZATION> Rotherham </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said an undetermined number of private cabins had burned in the sparsely populated area. <LOCATION> Crawford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> treated several people for minor injuries, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Skavdahl </PERSON>. Earlier, the four patients at the hospital were taken by bus to the <ORGANIZATION> Chadron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> because of the smoke and closeness of the flames, said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wigington </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Chadron </LOCATION> director of nursing services. And about 25 residents of the Ponderosa Villa nursing home were taken to a dormitory at <ORGANIZATION> Chadron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. `` The elderly people are at higher risk. They do n't breathe as well,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, director of nursing services at the nursing home. More than 600 visitors were evacuated from the campgrounds, lodge and cabins at <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> because of the shifting wind and smoke, although authorities said there was no immediate danger to the tourist facilities, said <ORGANIZATION> Rotherham </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was extremely smoky, just so you could just about breathe,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rotherham </ORGANIZATION> said. State Sen. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON>, who lives on a ranch near <LOCATION> Chadron </LOCATION>, said the fire was the worst she has seen in the area. `` There have been three big fires out here in 15 years and right now I think that this is probably the worst of all of them,'' she said Sunday. <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> said the rough country will hamper firefighting efforts. `` I do n't know how they can go about fighting a fire like that,'' she said. `` It's been very dry out here.''

 A 16-year-old girl charged at a robber who was holding an ax to her mother's throat, saving her mother but getting slashes that required 200 stitches, authorities said. `` He said, ` If you scream again, I'll hit you even harder,' and I just screamed louder,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> as she recovered from Saturday's attack at her family's copy business. `` I saw blood everywhere but I did n't know how badly I was hurt.'' `` All I could think of was that I had to get that ax away from my mother's neck,'' she said. <PERSON> Alvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, a 32-year-old ex-convict who has been living at a nearby halfway house, was arrested Sunday and was being held at the city jail, Lt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> was taken into custody after his sister called police and said her brother was ready to turn himself in, <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said the assailant entered the Rose Copy shop _ named for the girl _ about noon and asked to use the bathroom.

 Six of the 10 richest people in the world are Japanese but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still leads the world in the total number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes magazine. For the third straight year, <PERSON> Yoshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON> led <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION>' list of private billionaires even though his wealth was n't quite as much as it had been 12 months earlier. <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON>, head of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Seibu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, has a personal net worth of at least $ 15 billion _ nearly $ 4 billion less than estimated last summer due mainly to a rise in the value of the dollar against other major currencies, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said Sunday. The estimate was far greater than the $ 2.8 billion that Fortune magazine placed as <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON>'s worth in its September 1988 ranking of those it considered the world's richest people. In last year's list, <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> estimated <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON>'s net worth as $ 18.9 billion. The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that <PERSON> Tsutsumi </PERSON> edged out second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, has an estimated net worth of $ 14.2 billion. In last year's survey, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> placed <PERSON> Mori </PERSON>'s worth at about $ 18 billion. The third-richest on the list was American <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> <PERSON> Walton </PERSON>, founder of the third-largest retailer in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Walton </PERSON> and his family are worth an estimated $ 8.7 billion, up from <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION>' 1988 estimate of $ 6.5 billion After the <ORGANIZATION> Waltons </ORGANIZATION> came <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Reichmann </PERSON> brothers, owners of the <ORGANIZATION> Olympia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of about $ 8 billion. The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and industries, according to <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, were: <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyuk-ho </PERSON>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, candy, real estate, $ 8 billion; <PERSON> Hirotomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Takei </PERSON> and family, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, publishing, real estate, $ 7.8 billion; <PERSON> Kitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, real estate, hotels, $ 7 billion-plus; <PERSON> Haruhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoshimoto </PERSON> and family, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, real estate, $ 7 billion; <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausing </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, liquids packaging, $ 7 billion; and <PERSON> Eitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Itoyama </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, land, $ 6.6 billion. <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said it identified 226 individuals or families around the world with personal assets worth more than $ 1 billion. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was the country with the most billionaires, with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ranked second, with 41, and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was third with 20. American also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988 survey, 47, followed by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 32 and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s 16. Among the richest of the world's rich are people who did n't necessarily come by their money in an honest way <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years. Three of them made <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> `` World Billionaires'' list, including <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaviria </PERSON>, leader of the notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of $ 3 billion. The other cocaine kingpins on the list were the <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> family, worth more than $ 2 billion, and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>, with more than $ 1 billion. In compiling its list, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> does not consider royal families and heads of state `` because their wealth derives more from political heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal fortunes, not capitalistic ones.'' The magazine also excludes dictators, such as <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> or <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Decline in Corporate Name Changes in First Half</HEAD>
<HEAD>Embargoed until 12:01 a.m. EDT Monday; Time set by source.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A few memorable names such as the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Air-Shuttle, The <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> disappeared from corporate record books in the first half of the year. But overall, the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies that changed their names fell 18 percent in the first six months of 1989 compared with a year ago, the first such decline in four years, according to a survey for release Monday. The identity consulting firm <ORGANIZATION> Anspach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grossman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Portugal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> attributed the decline to a slower pace of business merger activity than a year earlier. The firm said 767 American companies changed their names in the January through June period, down from a record 931 name changes in the first six months of 1988. It was the first such decline since 1985. Despite the slower pace of merger activity, mergers and acquisitions remained the most frequently cited reason for name changes in the latest period, accounting for 351 changes, or 46 percent of the total. Corporate downsizing, spinoffs and asset sales accounted for 177 of the name changes or 23 percent of the total. The Air-Shuttle, for instance, was renamed the Trump Shuttle after developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought it from troubled Eastern. The survey said there were 139 elective name changes, or 18 percent of the total. Included among these were <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s adoption of the name <ORGANIZATION> AmBase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utilities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s change to <ORGANIZATION> Entergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Derrick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s switch to <ORGANIZATION> Amdura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The remaining name changes were done to reflect corporate restructuring or reorganization, changes to a holding company and other assorted changes in legal status. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Portugal </PERSON>, a principal at <LOCATION> Anspach </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grossman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, said some companies are finding value in sticking with their names or a shortened version of them rather than creating entirely new names. He said they have found an existing name `` can have real value, like any other corporate asset.'' He said F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> appeared to be following that strategy by streamlining its name to <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Fuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> did so by changing to <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. Even <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western, which became <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last month, turned to an old <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> name many people recognize, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a maker of bottled fruit drinks, capitalized on its major brand name by changing to <ORGANIZATION> Veryfine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cars </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> became Sterling Motor Cars The number of thrifts, banks and other financial institutions that changed their names fell to 195 in the latest six-month period, down from 254 a year earlier, the survey stated. It said an increasing number of thrifts dropped the `` S & amp; L'' from their names in favor of `` bank,'' possibly reflecting recent concerns about the large number of thrifts that have required federal assistance. One of the more unusual name changes by a bank was the decision by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to change its name to <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> for Business. The New York-based bank _ which formerly catered almost exclusively to women customers _ said the change reflected its belief that women no longer were discriminated against by other banks and by a decision to expand into middle market commercial lending. Overall, <PERSON> Anspach </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON> <PERSON> Portugal </PERSON> said, the number of manufacturers changing their names outpaced changes by financial institutions for the first time, 229 to 195. The next most frequent changes by industry were 64 in communications, 57 in technology and 37 in retailing.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has dropped its estimate of the number of cars and light trucks likely to be sold this year industrywide by up to 300,000 vehicles, further evidence of a softening car market. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> on Friday lowered the company's estimate to about 14.7 million from about 15 million cars and trucks, an estimate the company held for months <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Iacocca </PERSON> last month predicted a sales year of 13.5 million to 14 million vehicles, with roughly two cars being sold for every light truck <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has held to its 15 million vehicle estimate with the same breakdown between car and truck sales. <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> backed away from the car-to-truck ratio, saying he expected truck sales this year to remain at last year's level of about 5 million units. That means the reduction in sales volume would come from the car market. `` I'm sure the June -LRB- sales -RRB- numbers were the thing that knocked them off their pedestal, so to speak,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Earlier this week, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> reported its domestic car sales during June were running 12.3 percent behind the pace during the same month last year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s June car sales were 12.4 percent lower than last year's and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s were down 17.5 percent. But sales during June of last year were exceptionally strong, mostly because of attractive incentives. This June incentives also were offered, but they did n't generate the same kind of buying interest as they did in 1988, a fact <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> acknowledged Friday. Last year was the second-best sales year in industry history, with 15.8 million cars and light trucks driven off dealership lots. The 16.3 million vehicles sold in 1986 made that year the best in history. Although he expected lower sales volume for the industry, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said it would still be a good year. `` The auto industry has been coming down gradually since its peak in 1986,'' <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said after receiving an award as manager of the year from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've had quite a run here,'' <PERSON> Phillippi </PERSON> said of the past five years of vehicle sales. `` We have been due for a correction.'' While <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> have been losing market share during the past year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has been gaining. Also on Friday, <PERSON> Petersen </PERSON> said more plant closings and layoffs are possible during the third quarter beyond the normal breaks for summer vacation and model changeovers. However, he addedm that he did n't think the layoffs would be significant or long-lasting.

<HEAD>Greek Bank To Be Sued for $1.5 Billion By Angry Depositors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROCKS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Greek bank whose U.S.-based officers are charged with racketeering bilked depositors of hundreds of millions of dollars, an attorney alleged Sunday. The depositors plan to file a class-action lawsuit Monday seeking $ 1.5 billion in damages from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION> and 14 of its officers, said <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Kangles </PERSON>, lead attorney in the lawsuit. The bank is the subject of a racketeering investigation by federal authorities, who on June 21 raided branches in four states, seizing documents and arresting the officers. A federal complaint filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> charges the bank with illegally accepting more than $ 700 million in deposits from customers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and sending the money overseas to avoid taxes. `` You had widows investing ... all the money they had to get the higher interest rates'' offered by the Greek bank, <PERSON> Kangles </PERSON> said. `` There's nothing they can do. There's a deep feeling the money's not there. Bank officers told customers that interest _ as much as 18 percent a year _ would be paid in Greek drachmas and would not be subject to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> taxes, <PERSON> Kangles </PERSON> said. He said about 300 people were party to the lawsuit and that their ranks could swell to as many as 3,000. He said the $ 1.5 billion represented treble damages based on a conservative estimate of about $ 500 million in deposits. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION> is a separate entity from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION>, which also operates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION> owns about 47 percent of the mortgage bank, federal authorities say. Phone numbers for the mortgage bank's Chicago-based officers were unlisted, and calls Sunday to the two Chicago-area branches went unanswered. According to court documents, the bank advertised in Greek-language newspapers, promising that the accounts would be secret. `` They put it in the newspaper,'' <PERSON> Kangles </PERSON> said. `` Almost everybody believes what they read in the newspaper.'' The seven branches, in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, were not even legally authorized to accept money from customers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, authorities say. Rather, the branches were opened with the ostensible purpose of encouraging investment in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kangles </PERSON> said some depositors had gone to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> to try to get their money back, and were told accounts were frozen. Some of the depositors could face criminal charges if it is shown they willfully sought to evade taxes, <PERSON> Kangles </PERSON> said. But he said most of the people did not report the money on their tax returns because they believed the bank's claims of tax-free status. Part of the damage award the depositors are seeking would go to pay penalties the depositors would owe the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kangles </PERSON> said.

 Maverick labor organizer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> met with about 200 striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants Sunday, urging them to broaden their battle beyond the picket lines and target the airline's stockholders and other investors. `` These workers have tremendous skills that can be put to use, whether it's canvassing neighborhoods, putting together mailings ... or speaking to the media,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, 45, said after the meeting at a hotel at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` They've got to be mobilized, they've got to be transformed into a powerful economic and political force that can go out and build economic and political support,'' he said. With the strike in its fourth month, the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> hired <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> last week to try to bring the strike to a successful end. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said he and the union will hold a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> news conference Wednesday to name specific actions they will take in the next phase of their strike. `` Once union leaders realize that everybody can become involved in a campaign's strategy and tactics, then they can win,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, who has incurred the wrath of some union leaders for his maverick style, said his organization, <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, is working without a fee to help beat <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a man considered one of union's most formidable foes `` This guy is a tough nut to crack,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said of the man who has come out on top in past union struggles with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, another unit of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` I think we can play an important role in making this a successful struggle.'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said he will contact 65,000 to 90,000 community and union leaders nationwide and push for their support not only against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, but also against corporations that are investing in the carrier. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> refused to name any specific actions he'd take against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> investors. In past strikes, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> has caused controversy by forging ahead in spite of the reservations of union leaders. `` Ray has a tremendous talent as an organizer, particularly in a strike situation, to get members involved and enthusiastic,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. `` Where he has a problem is that he sometimes tends to substitute his judgment for that of the elected leadership.'' The flight attendants union hired <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> because they have faith in his leadership abilities, said <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>, the union's financial secretary `` We've had thousands of people ask us, ` What can we do?''' she said. `` We were n't able to give them the kinds of jobs which we would like to have given them. Now we can.'' `` We hired <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> the organizer, not <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> the renegade,'' she said.

<HEAD>INS Says Airline Allows Illegal Aliens To Enter Country</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Strikebound and financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> may face a new problem _ with immigration officials who say the carrier is doing little to stop illegal aliens from flying into this country. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>, district director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been warned repeatedly to tighten up checks of aliens taking flights to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said of particular concern has been an increase in Cuban nationals arriving at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Eastern flights from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and other Latin countries. Forty-seven Cubans were arrrested Saturday for immigration violations, he said. <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said he plans to meet Monday with a federal prosecutor to discuss possible charges against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION>. Air Panama may be linked to a phony passport operation, <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. `` The airlines have got to become much more responsible in that area,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said Saturday. `` Eastern is very slack on this and always has been.'' Eastern spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> denied the airline was lax in checking documents. But he said there has been a problem with forged papers. Airlines must check immigration papers before issuing a ticket to a foreign national to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We do admit, and I think we've explained this to <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION>, we're coping with a flood of forged documents, no question about it It's an age-old problem in our business,'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said `` We will certainly study whatever complaint he plans to bring up,'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> added. Some Cubans arrested last week told the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> they bought passports in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, used them to board their flight, then gave the passports to a Panamanian official before takeoff. `` Apparently in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, it appears that the Panamanian government is condoning and actually arranging for Cubans to get on flights,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said. `` Possibly both <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> staff may have full knowledge of this.'' <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said he had heard nothing about passports collected on an Eastern plane. `` I'm going to vigorously pursue this with the attorney general,'' <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON> said, saying <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s flight crew would had to have known about the activity.

 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON>, former president and chief executive officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer subsidiary that was closed in April, has left <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> to form another company. <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON>, who headed <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, said he briefly explored the possibility of purchasing <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION>'s assets from <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>. But he and former <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Moschner </PERSON> decided to start a new Twin Cities company, he said. The new company will make special-purpose, high-performance computers, <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON> said Friday, adding that its product line will not resemble a general-purpose supercomputer, which was the ETA product. <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON>, who presided over <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to challenge Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in the world supercomputer market, was removed from the helm of <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> last October in a restructuring that folded <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> into the parent company. He was reinstated at <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> in February when <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> reversed its earlier plan. That prompted speculation that <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> was for sale or seeking an investor and that <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON> was a key ingredient in that strategy. <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> was closed following losses of more than $ 100 million last year. While <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> fell victim to its own technological delays and to <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION>'s worsening financial problems, <PERSON> Ledbetter </PERSON> became well-known in the supercomputer industry and was credited with having fought an uphill battle to make ETA a competitor.

<HEAD>Group Says Ford Uses Loopholes To Avoid Paying Gas-Guzzler Tax</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> exploited loopholes to avoid paying $ 200 million in `` gas guzzler'' taxes during the 1986 model year, a consumer advocacy group claims. <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> of the Center for Auto Safety said that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> substituted its 1986 Thunderbird for several larger, less fuel-efficient cars in compiling projections to determine which models would be subject to the gas-guzzler tax, a special levy placed on models that fail to meet fuel-efficiency standards. `` By slipping this wolf into sheep's clothing, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> avoided up to $ 200 million in gas-guzzler taxes,'' <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON> wrote in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> did nothing illegal but appeared to have violated the spirit of the complex gas-guzzler tax law. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Certification Division, said he could not confirm the $ 200 million figure. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> questioned its methods for figuring tax liability but said it had done nothing wrong. `` <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said that, in the future, it would take special care to avoid this situation,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buist </PERSON>, director of the automaker's <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emissions </ORGANIZATION> and Fuel Economy Office. In a similar case, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> was cited in <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> documents for using loopholes to avoid paying $ 29 million in gas-guzzler taxes in the 1988 model year.

<HEAD>New Bid For Allegheny Flops With Unsecured Creditors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An attorney for unsecured creditors of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rejected an offer of $ 700 million for the troubled small appliance maker. The attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sable </PERSON>, said creditors are making significant progress in negotiating their own plan for reorganizing the company under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act. The bidders, <ORGANIZATION> Steinhardt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japonica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, told stockholders, creditors and lawyers in a letter that they would use cash, debt and stock to take over the Pittsburgh-based company. They offered few other details. `` It's not something that's going to make a great deal of difference at this point,'' <PERSON> Sable </PERSON> said Friday. `` There's a lot of resistance to opening it up to a sale at this point.'' The company declined to comment. Several previous efforts to sell <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> failed. Among them was a $ 750 million offer from <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The investment banking firm withdrew its offer after management failed to meet its performance goals. <PERSON> Steinhardt </PERSON> said it manages $ 1.5 billion in financial assets. <PERSON> Japonica </PERSON>, founded by two former vice presidents of the investment bank <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION>, recently offered $ 1.6 billion for <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> railroad, but lost out to a higher bid.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Sale of Coleco to Hasbro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal bankruptcy judge has approved the sale of financially troubled <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s major product lines to the nation's largest toymaker, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Under the terms of the deal, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> will pay $ 85 million in cash for most of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s products, including such widely known toys as the Cabbage Patch Kids and the Scrabble and Parcheesi board games. Approval of the sale Friday signaled the end of the nearly yearlong bankruptcy case of the Avon, Conn.-based toymaker. Judge <PERSON> Prudence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abram </PERSON>, who approved the sale, predicted that the complex case, which has involved a frequently acrimonious battle between creditors, could be wrapped up by the fall. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on July 11, 1988, citing debts of $ 540.3 million. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Alperin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>'s executive vice president, testified Friday that the <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, company wants to complete the purchase by next week so it can begin advertising and producing the Coleco products before the Christmas sales season begins. Once the sale is completed, most of the remaining 80 employees at <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters will be laid off in phases as the business is closed and the court case completed, said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer After the sale, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> will retain a few minor toy products, some real estate and more than $ 135 million in cash _ the $ 85 million from <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> plus $ 50 million in the bank. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> plans to sell its remaining products and real estate and reorganize as a new company. Most of the new company's stock will be owned by <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s creditors, with current stockholders owning a minority interest. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest creditors, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> businessmen <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Perlmutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Marden </PERSON>, will receive a total of $ 65 million of the cash gained through the reorganization. The payment is $ 26 million less than the total owed to them, but the two agreed to the reduced amount to settle a lawsuit filed against them by the unsecured creditors' committee in the bankruptcy case. The committee's suit charged that <PERSON> Perlmutter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marden </PERSON> cheated <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> out of $ 71 million through separate business dealings with the company from 1986 to 1988. When <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> reorganizes, it will have to come up with a new name because <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> is buying the right to use the <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> name on toys. <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> joked during testimony Thursday that executives had considered but rejected the name `` Toys Were Us.''

<HEAD>UAL Stock Soars On Takeover Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, again may be a takeover target, and trading in its shares closed out the week with plenty of loft. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> was the most active issue traded Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, soaring by $ 13.50 a share to close at a new high of $ 166. Nearly 1.9 million shares changed hands Friday and the $ 166 eclipsed the previous 52-week high of $ 152.50 set the previous day. In a court ruling released Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> sided with the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> by invalidating parts of a <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union. These provisions gave the Machinists the right to reopen their contract and strike if the airline were acquired. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots argued that the provisions amounted to illegal anti-takeover measures aimed at blocking the $ 110-per-share bid for the company they first proposed in 1987. `` We have never abandoned our pursuit of the company,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots unit. `` Those covenants were impediments to our financing, and now they're apparently out of the way.'' <PERSON> Dubinsky </PERSON> said the union is considering a revised bid for the airline. Even before news of the court ruling reached the market, there was a buying surge earlier Friday, attributed by analysts to speculation that an offer for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> might come from its management. A <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman declined to comment on the developments.

 The explosion of a major pipeline in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> decreased the country's gas supply by 20 percent, forcing cuts in gas exports and supplies to domestic factories and consumers, a government official said. Gas Minister <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernomyrdin </PERSON> also said Soviet consumers should conserve gas used in kitchen stoves and brace for shortages of rubber and plastic goods made from the petroleum products the pipeline carried. A 1,153-mile pipeline carrying a mixture of benzine, propane and butane from western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to chemical factories and kitchen stoves in the country's center burst June 4 as two passenger trains were passing. A spark from the Trans-Siberian Railroad trains touched off an explosion and fire, incinerating more than 600 passengers 745 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said workers noticed a drop in pressure caused by the leak but increased the flow instead of shutting the line down. On the day of the accident, a <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the gas flow from the region was quickly diverted to an alternate pipeline and that no significant disruption occurred. It was not immediately possible to explain the discrepency in the two official's assessments. <PERSON> Chernomyrdin </PERSON> told the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, in an interview published Saturday, that the pipeline carried 13,500 tons of the 17,000 tons of liquefied gas that western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> supplies daily to the country's center. He said the accident caused a daily production shortfall of 5,000 tons. <PERSON> Izvestia </PERSON> did not say how many tons of gas the nation produces, but it said the accident caused a 20 percent reduction in gas supplies in June. <PERSON> Chernomyrdin </PERSON> said many petrochemical factories are either idle or working at half strength because of the gas shortfall. He also said raw petroleum products supplied to industry will be cut by 25 percent in the third quarter of the year, causing losses in the millions of rubles. The gas shortage and decreased plastic and rubber supplies will affect Soviet consumers already grappling with shortages of meat, butter, toothpaste, sugar and matches. <PERSON> Chernomyrdin </PERSON> said gas supplies to the 41 million stoves in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be cut 6 percent in the third quarter. The minister urged people to conserve gas in their homes and use alternate fuels in country houses. The disruption also is hurting the nation's attempts to obtain foreign currency badly needed in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive to modernize domestic industry. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the world's largest oil and gas producer. <PERSON> Chernomyrdin </PERSON> said the loss of the pipeline would force a 60 percent reduction in gas exports in the third quarter, depriving the country of $ 12.5 million in foreign currency income. Because it wo n't be able to fulfill some contracts with foreign customers, the Soviets will have to pay $ 1.6 million in fines and spend $ 31.2 million in foreign currency on repair equipment. In all, he said, repairs will take half a year and cost more than $ 156 million. Natural and man-made disasters have hampered the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> administration. The nation spent millions to clean up and rebuild after the 1986 <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power plant accident and the December 1988 earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>.
